Orcas Island Voices,"Washington, United States",Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: Orcas Island Voices

I n early 1990, I went to Orcas Island in Washington's San Juan islands to stay with family and friends at an older estate nestled on 80 beautiful wooded acres. It was a hot August afternoon and everyone but myself left to go play tennis. After lounging around awhile outside I got hot and decided to cool off inside.

The house was very lovely so I gave myself a self-guided tour. I ended up in what looked like attic space saw a lovely wood framed mirror of which I peered inside. Suddenly, I could hear voices around me, wildly talking in an attempt to be heard. Surprised and a bitshocked, I ran downstairs and fled outside. I was not going back in that house alone! When the owner's son returned with my family, I asked who might be haunting the house. I was told that there was a ghost in the house and it was a woman who had killed herself several decades earlier. She had stuffed her car's tail pipe with a rag and ran the engine in the garage until she died of carbon dioxide poisoning. She left this world but didn't leave the manor.

Mommy,"Washington, United States",Apparitions / Voices / Touches,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Apparitions / Voices / Touches :: Mommy

T here was a period in 1995 where a little girl lived in my house. I was laying in bed one morning relaxing before getting up and I heard a small girl's voice next to me say, ""Mommy."" It was so sweet sounding though that I wasn't afraid. About a month later, my husband of the time was fishing around in the library looking for a pack of cigarettes he had hidden when he heard a little girl ask him, ""What are you doing?"" Startled, he looked up thinking it was perhaps me but no one was there. This freaked him out and he promptly ran out of the house.

I don't know who this little girl was, why she called me mommy, or where she went shortly after these few incidents. I think sometimes only the ghost knows why or how they are there.

Sierra,Turkey,Family / Friends Visits,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Family / Friends Visits :: Sierra

O ne day my Aunt Sierra went with me to the beach and said she was tired. ""I cant wait to sleep on my pillow!"" she said. My aunt was killed a week later. One morning, at 1:30, my cousin and I were talking about her passing away, then a folded, secure pillow case fell off a shelf. My cousin and I hid under the blanket, we knew it was her. I looked up first and when I did, I felt like something I cannot explain, some feeling of fear, or was it comfort? Anyway, I believe the pillow case had something to do with that pillow Sierra wanted... you decide.

Driving Down the Road,France,Apparitions / Voices / Touches,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Apparitions / Voices / Touches :: Driving Down the Road

O ne day I was driving down the road late at night around 11:00pm and my car just shut off, I couldn't see anything because my headlights were off and my flashlight was missing. So I was on a dirt road and decided to see if there was help nearby. I heard foot steps and I turned around but no one was there. I found my flash light on the road and I turned it on and the light was pointing at a tree and I saw the words ""heaven is close."" Then I started to panic and I guess I passed out or something, and I ended up in my car again and it was turned on. I looked at the clock and it was 2:30am. I was scared out of my wits and dived back to my house in a hurry. I wonder what happened that night, can any of you help me understand this experience?

The Thing We Couldn't See,"Iowa, United States",Non Human Entities,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Non Human Entities :: The Thing We Couldn't See

I 'd taken Dynishka to my mother's for a weekend visit. I'm not sure on the year, but I'll guess around 1987. Mom lived in Iowa. Dynishka and me were visiting from San Francisco.

For years I'd promised Dynishka I'd someday take her for a trek through my 'haunted' neighborhood. This particular time she held me to it.

We began by heading north up mom's street, which meant we were heading up a rather steep hill. At the top of the hill we crossed to the opposite side of the road, then entered a yard.

It was quite dark. As I groped to find familiar paths from my childhood, we stepped over plant material that felt spongy, and I remember thinking things had changed since last I'd made the neighborhood rounds. The yards there, in the old neighborhood, are massive, with backyards the size of football fields or better.

Finally we'd got (trespassed heh) to the back of said property, and there found a lovely little bridge crossing a small creek ... then a short jaunt and we were on another path that lead through the next yard, then on to the street north of mom's.

We headed west, past dark homes resting in ample yards ... toward the 'S' curve in the road. At the lower half of the 'S' - toward the north - was the house with the totem pole.

Le'me tell ya, this thing is weird. It doesn't stand upright, but is instead curved like a huge doughnut sunk half in the ground. It felt cold like ceramic or plaster, but I now guess it's composition to be of fiberglass. It was 'decorated' (I use the term loosely) with an array of oddities; a huge ear (about a meter in length), the face of a King off a deck of cards (unsure which suit), a large brain (perhaps 5x human brain size), um ... mushrooms, gosh, I can't remember it all! The thing looked like an acid trip realized in an incredibly weird sculpture. (I'll try to get down there this summer and take photos ~ assuming it's still there.) We stayed for just a short time. I was leery of the large dog I knew to have patrolled the property some time before. Though it was creepy, we hadn't yet felt haunted.

We made off for the church grounds. Once there, we lay down in the parking lot to catch a glimpse of the expanse of stars above.

That parking lot, historically, was always where I would acquire (if you will) 'the littles' ... the little folk, who then would always follow myself and my guest on the remainder of our explore. (More stories for another time?)

That night, though we thought we'd heard 'the littles' tell-tale whispers and giggles ... something else seemed to pervade. Not a sound, but a sense. Of darkness ... no, worse. It felt malignant. Vile. Evil.

Dynishka and me sat bolt upright and instinctively began to scoot slowly so our backs were together as there we sat.

The 'little's' whispers and giggles were stifled as birds and crickets before a storm. The silence was obvious and unnerving.

We moved to stand, and a growl met us. Though let me explain, it was less a sound than a feeling. Make sense?

We decided we should flee ... and I decided to cut through the Robinson's ... a densely wooded yard that opens to a field which leads back to mom's street.

The growl moved in front of us. Mind you, I could physically see nothing, but the presence was unmistakable.

I gently touched Dynishka on the shoulder, indicating the direction of our next move with a nod of my head ... but I didn't stray my eyes from the spot my senses told me was occupied by the *Thing*.

Suddenly I burst off toward the road, not even wasting time to go through the Robinson's ... instead we went through the Kouskie's yard ... long as the other yards but not as densely treed. As we moved toward the back ... perhaps 100 feet from the house in the side yard, the *Thing* tried to get in front of us. By now, it was making such a racket I thought I'd go mad. I can't tell you now the sounds, I can't make my mind remember them. In fact, I wasn't sure at all if the sounds were in my head only and not out of it. Then I noticed from the corner of my eye that lights had flickered on in the Kouskie's house, and heads could be seen peering out toward us through assorted windows.

Somehow, knowing that others could hear (or sense?) the *Thing* terrified me even more. I'd ducked down to hide next to a truck-topper (sans truck), which had tall grasses all around it where the lawn mower couldn't reach. Dynishka dropped to her knees next to me, gasping. ""What is that?"" she screamed in a whisper.

For a moment, I didn't feel the *Thing* impeding our path. I took the moment to bolt. I hate to say it, but I was literally out to save myself ... not even stopping for a millisecond to check that Dynishka was surviving!

I'd got to the gate that separated the Kouskie's yard from mom's neighbor-across-the-street's yard. I was freaking out and not having an easy time with the latch, when again the *Thing* loudly made it's presence known. Finally the gate was open and we were sprinting across the expansive lawn toward the driveway ~ a long and winding drive. The formal garden surrounding the house is separated from the front by a long line of trees, which run parallel with the creek (mentioned earlier in my story). As we approached said line of trees running so fast nary a step touched the ground, we awoke what sounded like hundreds of sleeping birds, who all at once fled from the trees screeching and making a horrid sound.

Then I wasn't sure if it were birds I heard, or the thing which pursued us, or both. I should mention here ... outside of abject fear, there also seemed to be some weird time/space thing happening. I can't explain or describe it, everything just felt twisted and not real. Perhaps it was just terror.

Finally, out of the trees and making our way toward the front fence/gate (imposing gothic-looking black-iron jobby that was closed argh!) we didn't break step until we hit the gate and made to climb over. I felt as the men in ""The Omen"" who were running from the evil dogs in the cemetery, and had the terrible thought I'd impale myself!

I managed not to. We ran across the street toward the warm glow of the lights lining my mother's front walk, then could detect the comforting sound of my dog Benjy barking in the backyard.

We ran up the drive and crashed through the back gate to collapse on lawn chairs ... panting and laughing-almost-crying and trying to get a word out.

As we got our thoughts (translate as sh*t) together, and could finally talk, we sat and related in hushed voices what each the other had felt and seen etc. As we did so, we could hear that my horses in the pasture behind mom's house had come up to the fence [which kept them out of the backyard proper]. My dog trotted down the stone path to say hi to them, and we followed. Eventually, we stood at the fence, petting and cooing to the animals. Before me was Zeus, our largest stallion.

I remember now, hindsight, that he was acting odd (they all were). Skittish. But at the time, I guess I was trying to make things as normal as possible, and I shook it off.

Presently, Zeus took a long step back, an awkward movement, because he did so with only one leg. He then looked straight at me (into my eyes? Dunno, too dark) and commenced to urinating (?!), a long and drawn-out piss. His stance was, how shall I say, almost threatening, like he was a bull preparing to charge!

As Dynishka and me (and poor Benjy) were witnessing all this, the *Thing* dropped down on us from above. There were no trees directly above, just an 'old fashioned' type electrical line. It dropped to the ground directly between Zeus and me, but on *my* side of the fence. When I say it dropped, I mean, we could hear it ... feel the thud reverberate through the ground at our feet (we were all standing very close ... within a 3-4 foot circle).

Again, let me remind you I could physically see nothing, but my brain ... attempted to create a mass in the general vicinity of the *Thing* ... still I seriously don't remember physically seeing anything.

Anyway, the horses, including Zeus, erupted into wild neighing, bucking and kicking, then scattered as if wolves were after them.

Absolutely speechless, I looked at Dynishka, my mind groping for any sort of reasoning. Benjy broke me of my reverie (though I doubt it lasted more than a few seconds). Benjy was barking and making for the house. Again, we followed him.

For a moment, I could not see the house nor back porch, our supposed safety. Instead, I saw myself from behind running in panic, as though I saw through it's eyes.

We made it to the porch, Benjy was already inside via his own doggy-passage through the backdoor. I was tempted to jump through it myself, but my higher logic convinced me to use the doorknob instead. Dynishka and me didn't stop until we'd run to the front of the house ... to the front and formal living room (used only when mom has guests). Once there, we were oddly calmed. Collected. Moving pointedly.

I went to the secretary in the corner and removed a pen and paper. Dynishka switched on the stereo and retrieved a bottle of merlot from the wine cabinet. I sat on the sofa, pen in hand, with a mind to write of our experience. Dynishka sat on the floor near the serving/coffee table and poured us both a glass of wine. Though out of breath, we refused to show it. We were fine. My cats, one-by-one, began to saunter into the room ~ noticing that we were out-of-sorts, but not wanting us to think they cared enough to show any concern.

Just when everything was beginning to feel all right, a huge catfight erupted under the sofa upon which I sat. I mean, you could see fur flying out from below, and of course you know how awful is that sound! There was no doubt in my mind (at that time at least) my cats were fighting the *Thing* right under my caboose!

Now that's where the story ends. I know Dynishka and me took that bottle of wine to my bedroom where we sat with every single light on (including closet lights). We did not speak further of the incident that night. We simply waited for the sun, and thankfully the wait was uneventful.

I did eventually finish penning the whole story (by hand, somewhere in the region of 20 pages front and back). I held on to it for many *many* years, too. Though now, since I bought my house in '98 August ... I have been unable to locate the sheets, alas, I've done my best in this retelling.

Bed Time,New Zealand,Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: Bed Time

I t was a school night and I had had some real rough times at school. I had just finished my dinner and went to have a bath to relax but just could not stop worrying about all my homework. As I went off to bed I felt as though someone was watching me get dressed, but being used to it I just took no notice of it.

I jumped into bed and stayed awake worrying. I heard my dad turn off all the lights and go to bed so I knew it was late.

As I finally got to sleep, I awoke to someone jumping on top of me as I was on the other side of the house I freaked out thinking if my mom and dad could hear me. I felt as though he was pulling my soul out of me through my stomach. I tried to scream but he had hold of the throat so it felt like he was holding my voicebox in his hand. I tried and tried to fight him off but he just wouldn't move until I tried to scream one more time and he vanished (I knew it was a man because I could feel big strong hands and I could also smell him).

I ran into my mom's room and told her what happened and she got two lovely ladies to bless the house. I never stayed in that room again.

Weird Night,United Kingdom,Apparitions / Voices / Touches,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Apparitions / Voices / Touches :: Weird Night

M y friend Janine and I worked in an old Hall in Lowestoft, Suffolk in the early nineties. I was living about a mile from the Hall, we finished work at about 11:00pm and were going back to mine for a drink. There we were, me wheeling my cycle and her holding a plate with a slice of lemon meringue pie on it walking down an unlit dual carriageway, halfway down this road was a layby hidden from the road by a small island covered in trees and bushes. We heard a van pull into the layby and a minute later we heard a noise behind us, looking back we saw a man pretending to pee while looking back the way we had come, strange...

He turned and looked straight at us, jumped onto the road and started to chase us. We shot down the road, it was late with hardly a car about, Janine pulled me across the road in an attempt to force a car to stop but they just swerved around us beeping their horn. The road was empty again. The man was gaining on us, my bag had caught on my bike so I had to haul it on my shoulder. He reached out and grabbed my hair, I swung my bike and knocked him back. Running across the road we saw an oldish man walking down the central reservation and ran towards him shouting for help. He was dressed in weird clothes, a tweed suit and the trousers came to just below his knees like plus fours. We looked back, the guy had seen him too and had turned around and was running back to his van. We were only about ten feet from him but the old guy seemed not to see us and kept looking into the distance as though nothing was happening. This infuriated us and we ran towards him demanding to know what he was playing at, when, just as we reached him he disappeared! Absolutely gobsmacked we ran on until we got to the farmhouse where I lived and called the police. The guy who had chased us fitted the description of someone who had attacked a girl in the next village to us! One of the policewomen told us that many years ago a man and his family had crashed not far down the road and that he had tried to walk to the village for help but died of his injuries before he got there, he'd been seen quite a few times before. He may not have saved his family all those years ago, but he sure saved us that night. The upside of this is that all through this Janine managed to keep hold of that pie, nothing has ever tasted so good!

Suffocated by Evil,"California, United States",Psychic / Medium,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Psychic / Medium :: Suffocated by Evil

I have many ghost stories and will post them here separately.  This is the most ""impressive"" one though...

I was asleep one night when I awoke, realizing that I couldn't breathe.  Now, I have several cats (don't most psychic people?) and, on occasion, they will lie down on my face while sleeping... such is their way.  (As a wise person once told me - the one thing to always remember about cats is - if they were bigger, they'd eat you.)  :-)  So, I assumed this is what was happening.

However, when I was fully awake, I realized that I couldn't move and furthermore, that it was my pillow that was covering my face.  I was lying on my side and the pillow I had my head on, was folded up over my face.  So, once again, I assumed a cat had just slipped under there, but... that wasn't it.

I started to panic because I couldn't move and I also couldn't breathe!  Now - the pillow just wasn't covering my face - it was being *pressed into* my face.  I finally was able to, using all my might, move my head just a little bit back and forth.

After a couple seconds of that, the pillow suddenly dropped from my face and, standing right next to my bed, was this tall, thin ""Death"" figure, except all in white.  Like a skeleton in a long, heavy, hooded robe that covered all but the hands.  Where the face would be was just ""ethereal"" whiteness.

Within a split second, this figure reached down and grabbed by bedspread and pulled it over my face and held it tight, trying to suffocate me again!  I thought, ""This thing is going to kill me - I have to do something!""  But, again, I couldn't move - I was paralyzed.

Then, I remembered, that I had been studying up on auras and I realized - this was my only chance.  Again, with all my might, I envisioned an energy field around me and, when it had solidified, I pushed it as hard as I could towards this ""thing"" by my bed.

Suddenly, the bedspread flew off my face (and nearly off the bed) and I was able to see this ""thing"" being flung back to wherever it came from!  It just quickly flew back away from the bed, getting smaller and smaller until it disappeared.

When it was gone, I was suddenly able to move again, so I immediately jumped out of bed and flung on all the lights and started screaming and crying... still being frightened out of my mind!

I couldn't stop screaming and crying about it for 2 days - I had truly felt like someone had just tried to kill me.  I couldn't go to work... I couldn't do anything.  It took about a week for me to be able to go back into my bedroom and then, about a month for me to be able to go to sleep without having ALL the lights on.

People who know this event ask me how I could still live there.  I tell them - if something evil is out to get you - it will find you where ever you are - moving won't change that.

My Haunted Apartment,"California, United States",Psychic / Medium,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Psychic / Medium :: My Haunted Apartment

H ere are random little ghostly events that have occurred in my current apartment.

The first ghost experience I ever encountered there was awaking one night to find a full size horse standing by my bed!  (Quite a sight in my tiny apartment!)  I screamed ""What is that?"" and then noticed there was a cowboy on the horse, dressed in traditional ""Old West"" garb.  He tipped his hat to me, lightly kicked the horse with his spurs, and the horse sauntered off through the wall.

Now, I live on the 2nd story and the wall the horse went through was an outside wall.  So, people always ask me, ""Well, didn't the horse fall once it was outside?""  Hello!  It's a ghost!  If it can go through a wall, do you think a little thing like *gravity* would be a concern?  :-)

Another time, I awoke to find a guy standing at the foot of my bed.  He was dressed in a dark blue checked shirt and khaki pants.  He was about maybe 50 and was kinda pudgy.  He didn't seem threatening at all.  Once he realized I saw him, he just disappeared.

Another time, I was trying to fall asleep and noticed a ""lump"" under my blankets moving from the edge of the bed towards me, kinda slowly.  I assumed one of my cats had crawled under there and was approaching me, so I put my hand out to pet it on top of the covers, saying, ""Oh, what a cute kitty!""  However, as soon as I put my hand down for the pet, the ""lump"" disappeared - nothing was there!  That totally freaked me out - because, it had been a pretty big ""lump"" - definitely cat sized.

In my bedroom, I have a huge window that takes up at least half of the wall.  Living in the middle of the city, there is always significant ambient light coming through that window, not to mention my neighbors very bright security light he always has on.

Anyway, one night, as I turned off the light to go to sleep, suddenly, I was thrown into total darkness.  Like - have you ever been deep in a cave where no light can go?  The kind of darkness that is total, complete and ...threatening!

So, I immediately turned the light back on and looked out the window to see if maybe the power had gone off in the city or something, but, no, all my town's lights were still on, shining through my window.

So, I turn the light off again and...total evil darkness again!  Almost like, being thrown into another dimension!  So, the light came on immediately again and stayed on the rest of the night!

Another time, I awoke just in time to see this hairy creature running at me carrying a club over his head, like he was going to hit me with it!  I screamed and the creature stopped and was suddenly flung backwards, getting smaller and smaller until it disappeared.

Now, most of these things have occurred at night, so skeptics could say, ""Oh you were tired, so you imagined it"", etc.  However...

Several times, during the day, in my living room, I will have this little cloud of small lights appear and swirl around near the ceiling for several minutes at a time.  Since I am usually engrossed in my TV show, my cats are usually the ones to notice them first.  They will all run to just below the cloud and all stand up on their hind legs and reach out with their paws towards the lights, chattering the way cats do when they are excited.

Then, just as suddenly as they arrived, they are gone.  And, the cats go back to their business...of sleeping and destroying everything I own!  Oh well....

Beads Taken Off  by Ghost?,Canada,Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: Beads Taken Off  by Ghost?

H ere's the gist. My best friend (chrissy) has a ghost that came to her door a couple of times and it really freaked her out so one night she put prayer beads on the doorknob and it didn't reappear for the past year. Last friday I went to go changing in her room but the door wouldn't shut because there were things blocking it, so I took the stuff off and put it in her laundry basket. I closed it and started changing (no one was home but chrissy and her step sister), they were all downstairs, and the door opened, I shouted ""chrissy, wait, I'm changing"" then I closed it back. It immediately opened right back and I said ""stop it"", then I tried to close it again, I leaned on the door, and I felt the door knob twist so I open it but no one was there. I went downstairs and told them the whole story but they said they were down there the whole time then chrissy asked me: ""did you take the beads off the door?"" I told her I did, then we all freaked out and sent her step sister upstairs to put it back on. However, they weren't there at first, but when we looked back on the doorknob they were suddenly there again. I know I took everything off the door... It was a scary night.

Safe Ride Home,"California, United States",Psychic / Medium,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Psychic / Medium :: Safe Ride Home

I had been living in Santa Barbara back in 1993 when I found myself suddenly unemployed.  After several months without luck finding a job, I started going to the local Temp Agencies for work.  One by one they turned me down, telling me that, with my Engineering degree, they weren't going to be able to place me because I was ""overqualified"" for anything they had to offer.  So, out of the 7 Temp Agencies in town, the first 6 had turned me away, without even taking my resume!  However, the 7th place not only took me in, they actually gave me a job and I found out later that this last place was run by two ladies who both had strong psychic abilities and many of their workers also had psychic abilities.

So, anyway, at the job they got me, I became friends with this one girl (who also worked with them) who was a strong psychic.  She would tell me what I had for breakfast that day or what I would find in my mail when I got home, stuff like that - it was kinda freaky!  I was really into using a Ouija board at that time (and have since learned why one should never do that...) and that was this girl's main practice, so we would get together all the time and use her Ouija board, which she had had specially made...it was round and made of wood and elaborately decorated.  It was actually very nice, as a piece of art.

Well, this girl's background story was that - in every incarnation she had been through - she had always ended up being killed by this evil spirit who was jealous of her relationship with her ""soul mate"".  Apparently, also, she had always been killed with the same jeweled dagger.  So, in this incarnation, she said she had identified her ""soulmate"" and the ""evil spirit"" (whom happened to be married to each other this time around) and she had a photograph of them, with this woman having a jeweled dagger stuck in her belt, as some kind of ""decoration"" perhaps.  Anyway - so take this part of the story as you will...

So, we were doing the board one night and were talking with her ""Guardian Angel"".  Suddenly, an evil spirit took over the board and started swearing at us and threatening us, so we decided to send it away and call it a night.  At this point, it was about 2 in the morning.  We were discussing what had just happened, and, I mentioned to my friend that I would try to help her in anyway I could spiritually, to save her from her repeating ""fate"".  She thanked me and I gathered my things and left.

I was about 10 steps outside her door when suddenly, someone screamed in my ear!  It was almost like someone ran past me, screaming at me, because the volume was very low then very loud then very low again.  I spun around, but, of course, no one was there.  My friend lived in an apartment complex, but, being 2 in the morning, all was quiet around.  I was scared and went back to my friend's place.  I thought I knew what I had heard, but we brought out the board again and called for her Guardian Angel to confirm it.

So now, I am scared out of my wits thinking her evil spirit is now after me!  It took awhile to calm me down and my friend said that she would ask her Guardian Angel to accompany me home, to make sure I was safe.  I kinda ""poo-pooed"" that in my mind, thinking that wasn't possible, but agreed.  So, I get in my car and start driving home.

Several minutes later, when I was on the freeway of all places... what should happen but... suddenly a man (her Guardian Angel I assume) appeared sitting in the passenger seat of my car!  Solid as you or I!  He was about 35, blonde hair, wearing a red plaid shirt and blue jeans.  His body was turned towards mine and he smiled at me and waved and then disappeared!  I thought to myself, ""Huh!  Waddaya know!  He *did* follow me home!  That's cool!"".

Then, when I got back to my apartment and parked my car, this man appeared again, solid as before, sitting crosslegged on the hood of my car, again smiling and waving at me.  Then, the next morning, as I was taking a shower, suddenly two eyeballs appeared in the wall of my shower and looked around, then disappeared.  That freaked me out the most, but only because I was naked at the time in the shower!  I assumed the eyeballs belonged to this Guardian Angel.

So, nothing bad happened to me in regards to the ""evil spirit"" and I never saw the Red Plaid man again.  Many people ask me, ""Weren't you scared when he showed up in your car, when you were going 70 mph?"" and I say, no, actually, a sense of peace and calm came over me each time he appeared and I knew that I was safe with him.  It was a very interesting experience.

Sounds in the Attic,Norway,Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: Sounds in the Attic

A few years ago a friend of mine rented an apartment in an old house. A year after he moved in, he started to hear footsteps from the attic above. He told us about it, and we just laughed an told him he was paranoid and that he just hallucinated it. So one friday night while we were watching movies over at his place we heard the noises too. It was definitely footstep we heard, like someone was walking slowly back and forth. We could even hear the ""footsteps"" moving around the attic. So we paused the movie and listened closely. The noises stopped, and we saw the rest of the movie.

Afterwards we sat and discussed what the noises could have been, and just as we were talking about it the ""footsteps"" reappeared. We freaked out, but decided the we should check it out. Armed with frying pans and knives from the kitchen walked towards the attic. The stairs up to the attic was in the hallway, because all of the tenants in the building had access to it. The door to the stairs had a heavy padlock plus a regular lock in the door. We unlocked the door and sneaked upstairs. We turned on the light and there was no one there. The attic was empty except for an old sofa and some mattresses, so there was really no place to hide. Scared as hell we turned off the light and locked the place.

On later occasions we heard the noises, but we never really did anything about it, we just accepted it for what it was and though it was cool to have our own ""ghost pal"".

White Ghost,India,Misc,"S omeone must have pulled the emergency chain for the train, I thought, as it stopped so suddenly. The sudden cessation of movement caused us all to fall forward.

Shaken, we stood up and put our heads out of the now motionless train's windows. Most passengers crowded outside.

It appears that someone had been crossing the line, and had been struck by the train. It was just one station before my intended destination: Baharampore.

Someone remarked that the body was still lying there. I was about to have a look for myself when someone caught my hand firmly. It was none other than the fellow passenger with whom I had been talking throughout my four-hour journey from Kolkata.

""There's nothing to see in that lifeless body. There is only a lot of blood and some mutilated limbs,"" he said. ""It would make you very upset.""

It was half past four in the evening. My fellow traveler told me that he was also going to Baharampore, so we hired a one-cycle-van, being the only available transport for hire locally.

We talked ceaselessly as we traveled along. Sometimes about politics, sometimes about the present education scenario and sometimes about the high casualty rate in the traffic system. However, I couldn't help my mind returning to that unseen body. Who had lost his precious life, I wondered. I was twenty-six years old. There are so many things to see in life. Death was something I just didn't want to think about.

It was my first trip to Baharampore. A friend had invited me to spend a weekend at his home. I thought it would make a good escape from the clatter of Kolkata. It would be a change from the monotonous and weekly hustle-bustle of my everyday life.

On finally reaching my friend's house, I decided to say nothing about the accident or my ten-minute cycle-van journey. Actually, I'd enjoyed that open cab ride. Other than that mishap on the train, the whole journey had been most pleasant. I didn't want to make my friend unhappy by discussing sad things. Ankush, my long-time friend, was a good person, and his mother was anxious about the dish she was preparing for me. I didn't want to spoil anything that evening.

Since I was a city dweller, they were worried that I might find their rural home, which lacked electricity, difficult to get used to, but I really enjoyed sitting on the roof of their home on that starry night, soaking up the atmosphere, drinking coconut milk, eating fresh vegetables and fruits, and listening to his friends, whose native pronunciation of the very Bengali words I used was so very different from mine.

They asked me endless questions. About my work, my family and myself, which I was pleased to answer. I tried to respond in as much detail as I was able. They seemed pleased to hear that I am a writer. But, before long, I was rescued by Ankush.

Then one of his friends mentioned the accident that had killed an eighteen-year-old girl that very afternoon.

Ankush said to me, ""Hey, I think you must have been there. Didn't you see anything of it?""

I told them everything I knew, and explained the reason for my silence.

To my utter surprise, they laughed uproarishly, as though it was a common happening.

Ankush said that, indeed, it was not a rare thing thereabouts. They were quite accustomed to accidents on the railway line.

I listened to what they were saying to each other without taking any further part in the conversation.

Ankush smiled at me, and tauntingly asked me if I was scared.

On hearing this, I became angry. I didn't see that they had any right to accuse me of this.

Bhuvan, one of the friends, said to me, ""Well, could you go to where it happened? Right now. Alone? If you can, we can presume that you are not scared.""

Accordingly, we immediately went to the place where the accident had happened, but deliberately kept a fair distance from the exact spot. They dared me to walk right up to the place where the young girl had been killed. It was barely visible as it was lit only by the light from the stars and a partially concealed moon. Only the signal glowed red.

Despite Ankush's protest, I started walking forward. It was really difficult for someone like me, to accept this as fun. Nevertheless, I wanted to demonstrate to them that I was really a brave man, and that I could accept their silly dare.

Walking in the dark was difficult as stones were scattered everywhere. I found I was sweating as I walked. But it was a challenge that I simply had to win.

Suddenly, before me, I saw a shadowy white object quivering exactly where I was heading. I stopped for a moment. It could be an hallucination, I reasoned. I started walking forward again. But, now, the apparition was quite visible. It was a person draped in white. And that wraithlike person was doing something. Who or what was it? Was it an illusion or ... ? The possibility that it was something paranormal sent a chill was running down my spine. I almost died with shock as someone put a hand on my shoulder. I just stopped breathing and closed my eyes.

In that gloomy light I found it was none other than Ankush who had been following me. He also saw what I had been seeing.

We drew closer and found what we had seen was an old person swabbing the place with water. There was no body, nothing of the dead girl remained.

""Eto rakto! - So much blood!"" he was quietly saying to himself over and over.

It turned out that he was the stationmaster, whose son had died in the same way in a train accident twenty-five years previously. On one such cold night, such as this was, he was being chased by police officers and, without warning, a train thundered along and ran over him. After that sad incident, the stationmaster became mentally disturbed, and always took it upon himself to erase all evidence of such accidents.

Late Night Spook,Canada,Misc,"O ne night, after a long day at school, I decided to go to bed early because I had a bad headache. There is a forest in my back yard and I sometimes feel like someone is watching me, but that night it was worse, so I looked around and saw shadows moving. I decided to ignore it and went to bed. As I fell asleep, I started having this dream that a guy was chasing me in the forest. After running for a while, I turned around to see if he was still there but couldn't see him, so I stopped, turned around and he grabbed my wrists very hard. It felt so real like if I wasn't in a dream. I woke up, and to my horror, I saw that both my wrists were bruised in the shape of fingers. I still freak out when someone grabs my wrists.

The Haunting of Buffalo Ridge,"Ohio, United States",Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: The Haunting of Buffalo Ridge

O ne of the infamous spots around here is Buffalo Ridge, a hilly road that's just a bit northwest of Cincinnati in Cleves. It's actually home to the Mitchell Memorial Forest, a park complete with a nature trail, lake for fishing, and a playground for the kiddies! Woo hoo! Not only that, but SUPPOSABLY this road is where Charles Manson himself spent his Cincinnati years! (I say supposably since I know his family lived around here at some point, but I never really looked into whether or not he grew up around Cleves. Not that it's important to the story anyways) Well, the urban legends of this road are outrageous. Stories range from being chased across the road at night by white vans, to phantom cars from failed gang initiations, an evil dog with glowing green eyes, ghosts that run across the road searching for their missing parts for all eternity, and most importantly, the Crematorium. You see, the urban legends say this road was the site of a corrupt crematorium that dropped bodies out in the woods, blah blah blah. And now supposably bodies are still out there somewhere.

Well, in high school I actually had an english teacher who told me that one time he and his friend drove down there, pulled over and juuuust happen to open a random barn door for whatever reason, and found chickens hanging from the ceiling on chains, and their blood being collected on leaves below. So they ran back to their car, and of course Gravedigger or some other monsterous truck comes tearing out of a driveway and chases him all the way out of Cleves! EXCITEMENT!

That's all well an good, but as I soon found out from personal research.. there was never a crematorium there. What IS there to this day, however, is the ruins of Cincinnati's first Planetarium, hidden in the woods. In fact, if you're still reading and want to know more about it, I made a website explaining the whole background of Buffalo Ridge (with pretty pictures!). At the time I made that site, I had tried just about everything and experienced nothing more than a police officer pulling over and literally laughing at us as we explained to him that we wanted to see dead people run across the road. I can feel my self-esteem rising. It also occured to us that the park's staff had rangers in white vans visiting it frequently, thus killing the chased-by-white-van experience for us.

And so! with all that out of the way, I can now explain my story. About two weeks ago, I lead a couple friends that are new to the area down to Buffalo Ridge. These friends being my old friend Jonathan, who's the same age as me and grew up in Indiana, and Kay, his as-of-now-girlfriend. I think. Well, we get there at about 9:00 pm when the sun was close to setting all the way, and as usual I have them park down the road a bit near another road (the name of which slips my mind) and walk back up to a ""No dumping or we'll own your butt"" sign. Behind which, is a trail leading down the woods and into the ruins of the old Planetarium.

Being the loser who loves to tell the local history that I am, I was talking pretty loudly about the area, while Kay and Jonathan walked behind me. They both carried a couple flashlights to see better in the thicks woods, and I just toughed it out in front. Oh yeah, I'm a real man! ...I try. Anyways, we come to what I can only describe as the foundation of the building. A bunch of bricks and torn metal in the hill side is all I got.

We sat down and started chatting it up, about whatever, and a good 30 minutes passed. Jonathan and I were discussing manly things, like whether we should go get those tiny fries at Steak n Shake, or an even manlier jug of root beer at the Jolly's up in Fairfield. Around then, Kay started mumbling about how ""the air changed"" or something to that degree. So, in hopes to see something spooky, I climbed down into the foundation of the ol' planetarium, and took Jonathan's flashlight so I could navigate walking around on the fallen stones and what not. At one point, I remember Kay saying we should get going, and by then I had already made my way to the other side of the rubble and was wanting to look around some more. But! Jonathan didn't like making her nervous, so I agreed to climb back out.

So, being the nice guy I am, I started to make my way back across the rubble. At this point, I shined my light back up the wall I had climbed down to see Kay and Jonathan, when I saw it! A man I couldn't really make out from where I was, was approaching the two of them, so jokingly I shouted ""Hey, better tell that guy that we aren't sacrificing babies. Or drug dealers. Or drug dealers sacrificing babies!"" and went back to my climbing across the rubble. Eventually, I made it up the wall and... no one was freakin there!  Annoyed, I walked back up the trail to Buffalo Ridge, and found Kay crying while Jonathan hugged her. Aww. So I asked what happend to our guest, when Jonathan starts RANTING on, and ON about how ""This dude just totally came out of no where, walked right up to me.. and vanished!!"" Which made our heads spin.

From then on, we were pretty ecstatic, running back to the truck with Kay frightened, while Jonathan was excited, and I was pissed. I want a ghost to walk up to me and disappear! and I didn't even see it since I was walking over some flippin' stones and what not. Never again will I look where I'm going! ...Ok, bad idea. So finally, the story has become one of the only real ghosts we've got to talk about. But it's a fun story none the less, and has actually gone down at the Art Institute I go to as ""Jonathan and Alex vs. the Invisible Amish Ninjas.""

My Aunt,"South Carolina, United States",Family / Friends Visits,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Family / Friends Visits :: My Aunt

A bout 5 years ago my aunt moved in with me and my family because she was really sick and her kids lived out of state. I was always real close with my aunt and looked forward to her living with us. I was closer to her than I was with my mom.

Anyway, she stayed with us for about 5 months, then decided to move out west so she could be closer to her kids. After about 2 months of her moving out west, her daughter called me and told me my aunt was in the hospital and the doctors didn't think she was going to make it. I was upset, but I was also thankful that I had a chance to become even more close to her in the 5 months that she stayed with us. A week later I was laying on the couch half awake and half asleep when I had a dream that my aunt was skipping down my driveway telling me good bye and that she would be back. She was real adamant about the fact that she'd be back. She climbed into her SUV and drove off. Just as she was driving off in my dream, the phone rang and woke me up. It was my mother telling me my aunt just died. I knew that's what she was going to say even before she got the words out.

What was weird about the dream is my aunt looked healthy. She actually had some weight on. She was always skin and bones because she was so sick and the fact that she was skipping. My aunt could barely walk let alone skip. Plus she didn't own a car because she was always too weak to drive. I like to believe she came to tell me good bye in my dreams, but as far as her coming back, I kind of wish she would. I say I 'kind of' wish she would because I've never seen a ghost and know for a fact that I would go insane if I did.

Well, I'm curious as to what everyone thinks and if anyone agrees that she came to me in my sleep to tell me good bye. Thanks!

An Old House and My Apartment Building,"West Virginia, United States",Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: An Old House and My Apartment Building

I was in the Navy and living ashore at Norfolk, VA in the early '70s. It was an old two story house.  The main floor had a kitchen, dining room and living room. The second floor had a master bedroom, that nearly half the size of the house, a smaller bedroom and a bath.

One day I was in the master bedroom folding laundry. People came and went all the time (had a couple of roommates and they had friends) so the doors were seldom (if ever) locked.

I heard the front door open and close and called out I was upstairs. I heard heavy, plodding footsteps on the stairs, pausing at the bend in the middle. It was as if whomever was really tired and it was all they could do to walk up the steps.  From where I was standing I could see clearly down the hall to the top of the stairs. The footsteps continued to the top and down the hall towards me. No one was there. The steps were quite audible. At the treshold of the bedroom door they stopped.

I stood there shaking like a leaf then quickly exited the room. Some time later I returned home to find every light in the place on. A roommate was sitting in the living room, white as a sheet, holding a poker from the fire place, in front of him.  I asked what was wrong. He said he was watching tv when the door to the outside (the former front door since the house at one time faced Chesapeake Bay but at sometime was moved across the street, and turned around, so our ""front door"" had been the back door at one time and our back door the front) began turning on its own. He asked who was there and no answer. Then the door started shaking as if someone were trying to enter but couldn't. He went to the door and called out again, no reply. He opened the door and no one was there. And, the screen door was closed and lashed, with no breaks in the screen for someone to reach in.

I told him of my experience earlier and he said he had heard footsteps as well when no one was home. He never told anyone believing they would think him crazy.

Eventually others reported hearing strange things as well. The old house is no longer there. It was on a spit of land which has since been ""re-developed"" with freeways, ramps, etc.  -sigh-

My apartment building, in Huntington, WV, has several spirits. Residents in two apartments on the other end of the hall (I live in the back) have reported seeing an old woman, in a white blouse and long black dress enter their apartment, walk through and exit.  At one time this building had a landlady from who owned the place from about 1911 to '51. This could be her keeping any eye on her property. (I am the senior resident in the building -three story brick apartment, erected in 1906- having moved here in July, 1979, and people will ask ""You've been here a long time, have you heard of this or that happening?"")

One evening in the early '80s a neighbour and I were playing cards. No radio, tv, or such on. Suddenly we heard loud noises coming from his apartment, as if it were being ransacked. Scott went to check and nothing was out of place. I have also had the feeling someone would be watching me from that apartment when no one was living there. (My kitchen windows and that ones form a sort of L shape.) I named the spirit ""Casper"", after the cartoon character Casper, the friendly ghost since he means no harm, merely curious. And when I have feeling of being watched I always wave and greet him.  :)

It was August 2nd. A hot, muggy night. The cat I had then was laying on the floor facing the closed bathroom door. This was before the Net so I was watching tv and Muffy was in my line of vision. Suddenly she roused herself, started a low growl, twitching her tail, looking at the closed door, then to me, back to the door. I told her there was nothing there. Like a scene from a cheap movie I went to the door, put my hand on the doorknob and said, ""See, there's nothing in there"" and opened the door. Suddenly a cold rush of air passed through me, at least 20 degrees cooler than a moment before. After that Muffy was calm again and went back to her dozing... For a couple of years on that date I could feel the presence.  I haven't for the last few years.

Ann's House,United States Minor Outlying Islands,Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: Ann's House

I n 1978, my parents bought a 30 year old house which was originally owned by an actress who's full name I will not reveal, Ann was her first name... She was famous in the 30' through 50's era. Anyway, I was born in 1979 and from an early age I remember a few instances where I was spooked.

My first odd experience occurred one normal night when I was about 4 or 5 years old. For some reason I awoke and got out of bed. I heard something in the kitchen which was directly down the hallway from my doorway. It was very late or early in the morning. When I peered down the hallway I saw a rabbit on our kitchen counter; its eyes were bright and its body was almost see through - like a projection. I was scared and tired, so I ran across the hallway to my older sisters room and slept there the rest of the night. Sure enough nobody believed me the next day. Over the next few years I always heard noises in my closet and cupboards in my bedroom. And all the while living there I always heard shuffling and pounding in a large walk in safe in the downstairs part of our house. In the ten year span living there I always felt like I was being watched, and I would never go inside the house unless my parents or someone else was with me. When I got off the school bus, I would wait outside until my mom got home. It was not until my mother told me a few things that she probably would not have revealed had she known how I would react. I overheard my mother talking to my aunt about how the previous owner told her that an actor, by the name of Ann ""blank"", had built the house. Even more interesting, the previous owners laughingly said they would occasionally see her walking down the halls. Once, my mother even admitted to me that she was home alone reading in the living room when she felt someone touch her on the shoulder, it was a comforting gesture but scared her when she turned and saw no one around. I was scared of that house.

When I was about 12 we moved to a house my Dad built, same city but miles away from the old house.  The first night staying there I remember waking and looking out my bedroom window to see a white figure running down the lonesome road at a swift and graceful pace. Also, my beloved dog was in my sight and he ran from the object with tail in between legs... not typical, this dog was a butt kicking machine. It was weird but I was able to fall back asleep, next day nobody took me seriously. The last incident happened shortly after, I remember just laying down in my bed, it was a matter of seconds before I saw this woman hovering over me and she did not speak but it was like she said ""I have followed you"". I layed there paralyzed but managed to say ""GET OUT, LEAVE ME ALONE"". And ever since I have been totally ghost free, knock on wood. Long, maybe boring story for you guys, but real to me, too real.

Ghost Encounters,United States Minor Outlying Islands,Misc,"S ome will argue there is no such thing of ghosts. I understand those individuals may feel frightened by the thought of phantoms or banshees roaming our world. Or some individuals may just assume that ghosts are a bunch of silly fictional myths that our kind made up for amusing fairy-tales to be told over the past centuries. However, ""seeing is believing,"" and if I never saw the things I've seen in my lifetime, perhaps, I too would question their existence.

My first real poltergeist experience happened when I was about five years old. It was late at night and I was awoken by a sound coming from the dining room. I heard the dinner table chairs roughly sliding against the tile floor. When I finally realized I was awake and not dreaming I became horrified. A few seconds went by the chairs suddenly stop moving. Then the ever most terrifying thing happened. I heard an unearthly woman's voice call to me. The voice sounded like it came from the kitchen adjacent to the dining room. I can't recall everything she said but I'm pretty sure she was just saying my name over and over. The hardest thing I had to do was get out of bed and run like heck to my mother's bedroom across the pitch black hall. Eventually, after the paralysis wore off, that is exactly what I did. I remember tripping on the laundry basket as sneaking over to my mom's side of the bed. I didn't want to wake her and be sent back to my room. She woke up immediately when I crawled into her arms. She told me it was just a nightmare and to go back to my room. She had to turn on my bedroom light and walk me to bed. Naturally I couldn't fall asleep for quite some time that night, even with my twin sister asleep in the room. I remember having to stare at our Dr. Seuss light fixture for comfort. Every time I glanced at the bedroom door I would quiver intensely. I did not dare go investigate the kitchen or dining room until the next morning.

Of course everyone laughed at me the next day when I explained exactly what happened. My older brother and dad even had an on-going joke about the ""ghost chair"" (which was the only unassigned chair when the five of us were eating at the dinner table.) They would kid and demand my mother to fix up a plate of food for the ghost. I kept thinking to myself one day they'll see.

That day wasn't too far away, at least for my brother and sister. A few years later on a stormy early evening, the three of us were left home alone. At that time our brother was old enough to baby-sit us but too immature to properly company us. He used to tease us all the time about ghosts. ""Ghostbusters"" had just come out in the theater so of course that was still fresh in everyone's mind. One time he even made, what he convinced us to believe, a PK meter that would indicate if ghosts were near by. The little stick on the home-made PK meter would move sporadic-like so he would tell us that this house was haunted and filled with ghosts. But during this occasion, he decided to just tell us scary stories instead. With the lightning, loud thunder, our parents gone and my brother's wickedness, we became two very scared little girls. My brother eventually came to his senses and then tried to comfort us. He kept trying to reassure us that ghosts are make-believe. Then he said these words, which I will never forget... ""There is no such thing of ghosts; if there was they would show us a sign."" BOOM! Instantly after those words came out of my brother's mouth, all the lights went out. They eventually came back on a couple seconds later. My brother never teased us about ghosts since.

That incident may not sound tremendously frightening, but as a child it seemed as if I were living in a horror picture. My next occurrence may very well be the most petrifying. I was about eight-teen or nine-teen years old. My sister and I went for a drive to Siesta Key in Sarasota. The sun was just about setting and we decided, before we go home for the day, we should drive around the Key's ritzy subdivision to gawk at all the pretty mansions. We came across an empty lot, which is unusual because it was fairly decent in size and located right on the canal. All the other lots in the area consist of massive homes neck and neck of each other. It was so peculiar to see such a large waste of space which had so much value.  My sister wanted me to pull over on the curb so we could walk around to go exploring. She said ""let's pretend we own this lot and we're going to build a big mansion here."" As we were walking through the palmettos further within the lot, a sudden freezing cold chill overcame us and the sky instantly turned grey. My anxious sister said ""we need to leave NOW!"" She believed she was being intuitive and was shown a sign. She imagined something bad would happen to us if we stayed there. She even said ""I think someone is living here like a bum or some crazy person."" ""No, it's okay. We're fine."" I hesitantly replied; although I started to sense some uncertainty about staying in that lot. She said ""well I'm going back to the car."" I then quickly followed her thinking to myself I'm brave but not brave enough to be here alone.

We drove off into the subdivision to complete our little adventure in searching for a favorite mansion to drool over. It was now officially night time so we agreed to head out. As trying to find the exit of the Key we unintentionally came across our vacant lot. I stopped the car positioned head on so we could glance at it one more time. Because it was dark out we could see the lights from another home on the opposite side of the canal glaring through the trees.

My sister said ""oh look! You can see through those people's windows over there."" We both were staring at the same spot and then that's when it happened. A silhouette of man or creature appeared before us, maybe about twenty or thirty feet from the car. It looked like it was staring at us with evil intentions. The odd thing was that this shadow had no face. He was completely transparent. ""Do you see what I see?"" my sister muttered. I said ""Yup."" I don't think I ever pealed out of somewhere so fast than I did that day. We were frightened but it made for a good laugh on our way back home.

Up until then I never really felt threatened by a ghost; before they would just make themselves known. This one was different. He made it extremely obvious he did not want our presence on his territory. I would imagine he must have made attempts to horde off any other unwanted guests; after all it was the only empty lot in the whole neighborhood.

My only other evidential ghost encounter up to date occurred about two years ago. One late night I was sitting in my driveway trying to contact my spirit guide who I call Sunbeam. Spirit guides are thought to be predestined spirits who help guide us (subconsciously) through our lifetimes, similar to the belief of guardian angels protecting us. When I communicate with Sunbeam I don't physically see her or hear her voice. I just talk to her as if I am saying my prayers out loud. While sitting there rambling I abruptly noticed, to my left, a luminous apparition of a fair skin woman with long blond wavy hair floating down the street about three feet above the ground. She was wearing a soft blue and white renaissance-like gown and some sort of hat or veil. The instant we made eye contact she vanished before my eyes. I assumed I saw my spirit guide but I didn't have that comforting feeling I often felt when I'd communicate with her. Plus that wasn't how I envisioned her. If anything I thought she would look like just a ball of energy if she chose to appear to me. At times I believe that spirit guides do not prefer to appear to us because they have no desire to prove themselves to us. I then realized I had just seen a ghost.

My theory on ghost or lost souls is that they are deceased people who some how get stuck in a parallel dimension in between Earth and the Afterlife. I don't think everyone will become a ghost after they die. Only those who do not want to face the reality of dying or those who felt they did not want to leave here with any unresolved issues, are the ones who get trapped in this realm. The amount of time as a ghost varies for each individual. Some could be a ghost for centuries or more, some could be one for a couple weeks. It's not uncommon for someone, after they die, to linger around as a ghost for a little while before they cross over and ""head towards the light."" Some may be confused or in denial and need extra guidance or confirmation of their death. Once they accept their death they should be able to go Home.

If ever encountering a lost soul it is important to tell them they are dead and assure them that they will be okay if they just trust life and have faith. No matter what religion they were, or if not religious at all, they all still go to the Afterlife which is our true home. Keep in mind they cannot physically harm you. Most are just depressed and have no intention of hurting anyone.

Ghost encounters can be very overwhelming. During an encounter many people say they felt an eerie and cold presence. I suggest that feeling we get isn't because ghosts are dangerous or evil, but possibly because we sympathize with their pain.

Southern Gothic,"Washington, United States",Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: Southern Gothic

I n 1987, I was living in a house in Atlanta with four roommates.  We lived there for just over a year and during that time, we had several experiences with what we later became convinced was an actual ghostly presence.

The house we were renting was well over a hundred years old, having been built sometime just after the American Civil War when Atlanta had been burned and destroyed by Union forces.

The house was a beautiful old Victorian home located in an area of Atlanta known as Inman Park.  We were all pretty young (in our twenties) and trying to get started in our respective careers, so the prospect of sharing the rent for a wonderful old two story, five bedroom house with a full basement was an attractive one.

One week after moving in, we were all asleep in our rooms when we were awakened by screaming from our roommate, whom I'll call Hanna.  We all jumped out of bed and went into Hanna's room.  She was sitting up, saying that she had woken up to see the dark figure of a man standing next to her bed, looking down at her.  She said that when she had screamed, the figure turned and walked out of the room.  She was very scared and highly agitated.  Myself and the other male roommate (the housemates consisted of two male/female couples and one single female) immediately checked out the inside and outside of the house, but we could find no intruder.  (This happened around two or three o'clock in the morning).  We finally got Hanna to calm down and everyone went back to bed.  The next day, we just chalked up this first incident to nervousness about living in a new home that just happened to be a creaky and somewhat spooky old antique house.  (However, Hanna would not hear of that explanation and in the ensuing days, continued to insist that she had seen this dark figure standing by her bed.  She refused to stay in the house alone after that).

About two weeks after that first incident, we were again all asleep when suddenly there was a very loud crash and the sound of tinkling of glass from the hallway that separated all of the bedrooms and a common bathroom.  Once more, we all jumped up and ran out into the hall where we found that a full-length mirror that had been mounted on the bathroom door had shattered into hundreds of pieces all over the floor.  Since everyone had been asleep, we could not figure out how this had happened as the mirror frame was still securely fastened to the door and only the glass itself had broken.  (Atlanta is not prone to earthquakes and the street was not a busy one, so we ruled out the possibility that a large truck or something had passed by and caused vibrations to occur inside the place).

Later, similar ""poltergeist"" activity would manifest itself in many other ways: there was one instance when I was home alone in the house watching television when, for no good reason that I could later ascertain, three candles that were sitting on the fireplace mantle suddenly fell off onto the floor, almost as if someone had swept them off with a hand.  Then there was the phenomenon that we all experienced at one time or another where personal objects and other items would go missing, only to turn up later in a place where the owner would swear that he/she had not left them.  (On one occasion, missing car keys were found lying right in the middle of the person's bed after a thorough search had been conducted for them by everyone home at the time).  Other strange activity came in the form of knocking and tapping sounds heard coming from either the attic or the basement when it was certain that no one was in either space.

The last incident that involved the sighting of an actual ""entity"" occurred about two months after we had moved in.  We were having a small party at our place and a house guest, who none of us had met prior to the party, was taking a personal tour of the place on her own.  She suddenly came running up from downstairs saying that she had just seen a man standing in the corner of the basement.  She said that when she had called out to him, he simply disappeared!  We immediately went down to the basement to check and of course, found nobody there.  This was most interesting because there was only one entrance into the basement and a person who might have been trying to play a trick would not have been able to escape past anyone without being seen.  (As noted, that house guest who saw the figure in the basement was a brand new acquaintance whom we later determined had no prior knowledge that our place had any sort of ""unusual"" activity connected to it).

After about six months of all this, things seemed to quiet down and no more ""ghost"" activity was noticed or reported by anyone.  We began to convince ourselves that maybe, just maybe, we had all overreacted to some degree and perhaps we were all just being overly-imaginative about the whole thing.

Finally, toward the end of our time living in the house, my wife and I were out at a restaurant one evening having a drink and dinner.  We struck up a conversation with another couple sitting at a table nearby, two people who were complete strangers to us and whom we happened to meet that night by total chance.  When they asked us where we were living in Atlanta, we told them about our place in Inman Park.  They said, ""Really, we used to live in Inman Park.  Which street do you live on?""  When we told them, they said, ""That is interesting, we used to rent a house on that same street.  What is your address?""  When we gave our address to them, they said, ""Oh my god, we used to rent that exact same house ourselves,"" immediately followed by the women saying, ""Have you seen the ghost yet?""  Well, you can imagine that both my wife and I were completely flabbergasted to have received such validation about our ""ghost problem"" from two complete strangers!  We ended up comparing notes with them and they told us about many strange happenings they had witnessed in the house that were quite similar to our own.

That experience thoroughly convinced me that there really is something to the whole subject of ghosts and afterward, I no longer dismissed similar stories that I heard from other people quite so easily.

The Baca Family Experience,"California, United States",Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: The Baca Family Experience

H i, my name is Ruby, I am 25 years old and I live in Los Angeles, CA. To tell you the truth, I am completely fascinated with the idea of the afterlife, I've spent time searching on the net, and reading books, to find true stories, some of which I can correlate, and to learn more about the whole existence of the paranormal. I do not doubt at all that it is true, throughout the course of my life I've experienced some paranormal activity, although some were very ephemeral, but it was there, I guess it would be silly of me to say it was tangible, anyway I'd like to share my most incredible experience with you.

About 2 years ago I had taken over my step-mother's daytime job, the agreement was to watch over a sweet elderly woman, named Margie, for about 1 month, so I did, the job description was that I had to stay and live there throughout the course of my employment, so I agreed, besides, the Baca's were incredibly benign individuals.

At first it was great, I fell in love with Margie, she had a funny character, she also had senile dementia, but she was great none-the-less, every morning I'd wake her up and take her to the restroom, and on our way there she'd stop and say ""look!"" and she'd point straight ahead at what I saw was nothing, and I'd just smile and continue my task, that was about as weird as it got while with Margie, but late at night...

8pm was the end of my day with Margie, I'd retire to my room, which was the back room of the house, near Margie's room, a rather nice room but also the coldest room in the house. The first week was smooth, no signs of nothing, but by the second week I had experienced the unusual, I had brought my portable DVD player with me and one night I decided to watch my John Lennon documentary. I had fallen asleep watching it and I remember sneezing, about 4 seconds after that I heard a distinct ""BLESS YOU"", I got up so fast and frightened, I rewinded the DVD making sure that perhaps the documentary had somehow mentioned those words, but there was no ""BLESS YOU"" mentioned, I got up and opened my door to look out the hallway, but everyone was asleep and everything was quiet and dark, I was completely perplexed. The voice I heard was of a man, the next morning I ran the whole DVD again and no BLESS YOU'S, so I decided to leave it as that.

Another night I was in my room and I was about to start grooming my eyebrows but I was interrupted by a phone call, so I put my tweezers down on the bed, I later returned to find them gone, I started looking all over for them, under the bed, by the closet near-by, I even took every piece of bed garment off and shook it, I looked everywhere, 10 minutes later and a look of mass confusion on my face, I decided to go ask Paul (my boss) if he had borrowed them, he said no, so I went back to my room and I'll never forget the feeling I had in my heart, they where right in the middle of my scavenged bed, I was in shock not to mention slightly scared. I looked all around me and I remember my heart beating so profusely, I found it hard to sleep that night.

And finally on the last week of my stay I had awaken at 7am as usual, I began to make my bed, it was a queen size bed and it had 3 layers of sheet work, so I proceeded, when I came to the second layer I extended the sheet and laid it flat tucking in the right side. Now take in mind that this bed is a queen size so I have to walk over to tuck in the left, so as I finished tucking in my right side I walked over to do my left and to my surprise it was already neatly tucked in! I freaked out! Once again I stand alone looking all around me and I say ""THANK YOU, CAN I HELP YOU WITH SOMETHING?"", but the room echoed in silence. I couldn't hold it in any longer, I decided to confront my boss Mr Baca, which is Margie's oldest son. He confessed that prior to his purchasing the house, two lesbians owned it, and when he spoke with them, they warned him that the house holds spirits but they are benign spirits and that they like to play tricks on people. Paul bought it none the less, he lived in that house for like 20-30 years with his wife and 3 children.

Later down the years, his wife passed away sometime in '99, he believes that she roams the house, helping and cleaning as she always had, and the room that I had was their two older son's room, so she spends a lot of time in there. I felt at ease when he told me that, and pleased to have ever graced her presence.

I have always felt that I could deal with the dead, that I would try to help and understand them, this experience has proved to me that I do attract spirits and I am more than willing to help, I've had many more experiences but I will share those another time.

I hope you've enjoyed my story and if any of you experience similar activity, don't be frightened, I think your energy frightens them more than they already are, so try to hold this sense of comfort and don't be afraid to speak to them.

Dream Ghost,Canada,Family / Friends Visits,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Family / Friends Visits :: Dream Ghost

M y father passed away in 1988. In 1990 I had a very vivid dream about him. In the dream he was talking about my brother. The scene changed to a different location with my father on a hill holding my brother, crying and telling me that ""they shot him real bad""! He kept crying and saying this over and over.

In April 1990, two weeks after that dream, someone called me and told me that my brother had been shot and that he had asked for me.

The dream ghost experience freaked me out, because the scene in the dream was the location that my brother was shot at.

My brother survived the shooting. The one thing that my father did not say in my dream, was that my brother died. So after I got the news that he was shot, I knew that he was still alive and when people asked me if he was dead, I told them that he was alive.

A Bad Experience at Bachelors Grove,"Illinois, United States",Apparitions / Voices / Touches,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Apparitions / Voices / Touches :: A Bad Experience at Bachelors Grove

B ack on October 15, 2004, my girlfriend thought it would be a good idea to take me to Bachelors Grove Cemetery, a week before my birthday, as one of my presents.  I am really into the supernatural, so I was really excited about it.  I even went and bought a digital voice recorder, and got out my digital camera.  We left that saturday, at about 12:00p.m. I live about an hour and a half away, so I wanted to get as much out of this as possible.  When we arrived, we parked across the street, in the forest preserve parking lot, then walked across the street (there is nowhere to park other then there, and if you try to park elsewhere, you will be towed, and get a ticket.) The walk from there is not very far, but as we got closer to the gate, it started to feel really odd.  I turned on my recorder, and it would skip from 17 seconds, to 23.  I kept it going, and we took a whole bunch of pictures.  It was about 42 degrees that day, and it started raining, so we hurried it up, and took as many pictures as we could.  While we were there, we noticed a really bizarre feeling of being watched, and I kept getting the feeling something was breathing down my neck.  We decided to leave after being there about 20 minutes.  It was creeping us out, and we were the only ones there.  I left the recorder going till we got to the end of trail leaving the grounds.  Once we got to the car, I replayed all of our footage.  I almost literally had a heart attack at what I heard.  I heard a voice whisper to get out, and other things, like at one point I said to my girlfriend, take a picture of me next to here.  Then you hear, almost in a taunting manner, yes go ahead take a picture.  The really freaky stuff started happening after we got home.

That night, (now keep in mind, I am extremely healthy, and I never get sick.)  I felt perfect that day, and out of nowhere that night, I got a bad cough, and sore throat.  There is no way possible, I could get that sick, for being in the cold, dressed as warm as I was, for 20 minutes.  Anyway, the next morning, when my girlfriend came over, I was worse.  I had a fever of about 101, and I had been having diarrhea.  I was so sick, I could barely move.  She brought her laptop over, and we viewed the pictures together.  We got a lot of things on camera.  We got a picture of a man by a fallen tree, a full body apparition of a woman floating, holding what looked to be flowers.  Lots of other pictures were of faces, and white mists.  After that ordeal, things got worse.  About a month after that, we moved into an apartment together, and after only two months, we were in a car accident.  A month after that, she lost her job for no reason, followed by me losing mine.  No matter how many interviews we went on, we could not find a job!  That whole year was bad luck.  We got sick all the time with flu bugs, and had problems with our apartment.  We lost our place after barely a year!  We had to move in with my parents, and it was months before we found work again.  I really believe the cemetery had something to with it, because before that, we were happy, and healthy.  I will never go back there again.  My friends want to, but I tell them they are nuts.  There is something more to that place then people think.  I never believed in curses, or anything like that, until that happened.  Things have gotten a little better for us, but not perfect.  It's been two years.  I still have my voice recordings, and pictures, and I listen to the strange voices still. I show my pictures to people, and I have tried putting them on ghost sites, but they have never been displayed, like I hoped they would be.  To all of you ghost hunters out there, I would highly recommend you never go there.  That place is haunted, and a good find, but it's better to just leave those spirits in peace.  They obviously don't want people there.  Thank you for reading this.

The Burning Man,United Kingdom,Apparitions / Voices / Touches,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Apparitions / Voices / Touches :: The Burning Man

A bout 9 years ago me and a mate used to go to this caravan site a couple of miles up the coast from were I used to live.  During the summer we used to drink in the sites pub called the Mermaid, booze on the beach and chat up the holiday maker's daughters etc.  One year, a couple of months after the summer crowds had left, we'd gone to the bonfire that they have there to watch the fireworks and generally just join in with festivities.  We ended up staying late, just wandering about the site before finally ringing a taxi and waiting for it outside the Mermaid, inside the doorway of a rundown toilet block near the edge of the cliff.  It was quiet but there were still a few people about.

Anyway after a couple of minutes of us standing there, I'd seen something at the cliff edge, in a shallow ditch around 30 yards away; it looked like the start of a fire and I mentioned it to my mate - I remember saying 'What the hells that!', and I think his response was something along the lines of 'I don't even want to think about what that might be'.

We carried on watching and the fire grew until finally something blue became apparent in its center.  I couldn't tell what it was at first but it quickly materialized.  It or rather 'he' was a man in a blue boiler suit (with shoulder straps), wearing a tan cowboy hat and an orange shirt and he was digging hard into the ditch.  As he dug he got lower until around the point only his torso was visible the image seemed to evaporate, the fire closely following suit.  Me and my mate didn't speak during the sighting and I don't think we spoke much on the subject on the ride home but whenever I talked to him about it after that he'd always made a joke or fobbed it off.  I reckon some people just won't believe in ghosts...  As it is I haven't seen this mate for years and that experience is the only thing I really remember regarding him; that caravan site (Tunstall, near Withernsea, near the city of Hull - England) and that - what I can only describe as a spirit.

Some woman who I told about it in a nightclub some years later said maybe it meant something... I can't think what but sometimes I think maybe she had a point.

Man Walking Through Car,"Tennessee, United States",Apparitions / Voices / Touches,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Apparitions / Voices / Touches :: Man Walking Through Car

I have had several supernatural things happen to me over the years.  My great grand mother was a gifted psychic and I guess that I inherited a little bit of an ability to see things that others can't. This will be the first of several true stories that I hope to submit.  Back around 1980, I was on my way home.  It was close to midnight.  I was driving up this hill when I spotted this man in a long trench coat.  He had on a hat and was looking down. He was slowly walking out to the middle of the road.  I could see the headlights from another car coming from the opposite direction.  It was just getting ready to top the hill and I knew that they would not have time to stop and would hit the man.  I just braked and sat there waiting to hear the man get hit. Instead, I heard the car whiz past me. I opened my eyes and found the man walking through the hood of my car. I felt as though I was going to faint. I waited until he got on the other side. I then got away from there, only to have another weird thing happen to me about two miles down the road.  An army jeep pulled out in front of me.  I laid down on my horn and braked, but the jeep disappeared right before my eyes. That was a very traumatic event for me that gives me chills after all these years.

The Oxford Light,"Ohio, United States",Orbs / Lights / Mists,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Orbs / Lights / Mists :: The Oxford Light

I t's me again! and I have a lot to say. I'd appreciate getting some comments on this, since it's probably the weirdest thing to ever happen to me. First, for those who ignore me/don't know me/think I'm a figment of their imagination, I live in Ohio. It's full of ghost stories, and for almost three years, I believe, I've been investigating the history behind local urban legends. I also have a website, where I keep meaning to document my findings.. but um. I get lazy.

Here in Southwestern ohio, perhaps the most known ghost story is: The light. It's the most cliche story ever told, and I've heard several variations of it from all over the country. It's especially hard for me to take this story seriously since it comes straight from a college town, which are full off shenanigans! Well, to get to my point, here's our local version of a ""Light"" story, copy and pasted from Ohioexploration.com:

"" - This haunting comes from just outside of Oxford. The story goes that two forbidden lovers would meet up a certain driveway along the road. The girl take her father's car and pull out to the end of the road and flash her lights three times to signal to her boyfriend to come over. One night as he began down the road, a young boy was riding his bicycle in the road. The boyfriend, riding a motorcycle, didn't see the boy until it was too late. Both the boy and the boyfriend died. The girl later hang herself in the barn, of which, on remnants remain. It is said that if you go to the spot where the girl would flash her lights, and flash your lights three times towards the road, you can see small flashing red lights (the reflectors off the bicycle) and then a motorcycle headlight coming down the road. Some have even reported seeing many flashing lights, like at the scene of an accident, after the headlight disappears ""

Well heck! What's not to love?! So for the longest time, my friends and I have been investigating this story. First we had trouble finding the correct road, then for well over a year we apparently had the wrong spot on the road. In another version of the story, the girl supposably haunted her house also on this road, but it was burnt down. We actually found some burnt remains, but nothing I honestly think was a real house. Just a barn, with a tasteful rope haging from a broken rafter! But, finally, a friend explained to me that the way it works is you park in front of (Still inhabited) house on the road, and flash the lights, not this empty lot we were going to. This made me awfully suspicious, and I was ready to bust this myth faster than Adam and Jamie.. er.. on a good day.

So last thursday night, my friend and I decided we were going to beat this myth. I grabbed my video camera, two walkie talkies, and we made a plan. my friend, Tony, would drive, and I would get out of the car and station myself further up the road, then Tony would get in position, and flash the lights while the video camera recorded everything he saw, and I'd radio him if I saw any cars coming. We gathered the equipment, and headed out. After a stop at burger king (Mmm.. grease and salt), we made it to Oxford-Milford road at about 9:50 PM, which is lined with country houses, and other places I thought for sure could be an obstacle. But once you're far back on that road, it's pretty dark. The houses are all down hill, and covered in bushes, with few house lights I can remember. We pulled up to the correct spot.. and flashed out lights.

Sure enough, and much to my disbelief, there it was! A single, bluish-white light seemed to actually make it's way down the road. I mistook it for a car and cried out ""Tony! Car coming! Turn your car back on, we don't want an accident!"" Well, luckily, he knew better. This light just faded in and out from ontop of a hill, perhaps a yard away from our car, never actually coming down at us. I fumbled with my video camera the whole time. The oddest thing, as Tony pointed out to me, was that the light was straight ahead of us, and yet our car's windshield showed a reflection that looked like headlights when passing behind trees! Or, as Tony described it, ""like it's underwater.""

Well, the light faded away, and we drove up the road looking for clues... aaand immediately drove back! However, this time we pulled into a drive way and turned around to face the direction the light would be coming from, only to find ""The Light"" was already shining back at us, before we even turned off our engine, or even our headlights! It was odd though.. the light was incredibly bright, this was obviously no idiot with a flash light pulling our leg.. and yet, I was incredibly suspicious. So I gave out a war cry (""I'M KICKING YOUR BUTT, LIGHT!"") and Tony charged our chariot towards the light to find.. nothing.

Up the road, we saw a car coming, so finally I realized ""Ok, there must be a reflection! That's it, cars that are coming down the road must be reflecting off something! Ha! Genius!) and so I hopped out of the car, and stood to the side of the road. Tony circled back around to the correct spot, and shut the car off. He flashed his lights, and we waited. He reported nothing. Then finally, I saw some headlights coming down the road, and expected Tony to radio with me ""ALEX! LIGHT!"" ..but nothing. Really. a big truck with monster head lights straight out of a Steven King novel was gunning down the road, and eventually turned off of it, but Tony saw nothing but darkness.

So, hopping back into the car, we drove around looking for anything. Eventually, we both realized there was a light behind us, and thought it was a car. We.. were wrong. Tony realized what I thought was a car behind us had the ""watery glow"" and so he pulled over. Again, this light faded in an out, and just seemed to hover brightly about a yard away from us. It was then I realized something, I didn't see just the blue-ish white light, but also a yellow light that blinked. Like a turning signal! So again, I was convinced this was a car returning to their home. Heck, we weren't even in the designated spot to flash our lights! It was like it followed us this whole time! So, we drove off to the ""correct spot"" and out of curiousity, we flashed our lights while the engine was on. This time, nothing happened, so we finally left.

The next day, I had a friend at Miami University in Oxford hit the libraries for me. (I got friends in looooow plaaaces! ... Sorry. My attempt at a joke) and immediately, he ran into a librarian who had an entire manila folder full of people who saw ""the light."" And yet, there are NO records of a motorcycle accident, or a house burning down. Heck, the librarian lived in Oxford for 30 years and claimed she never ""even heard of an ambulance going down that road.""

So, that leaves me with this. I have a dvd handycam, with a dvd-r that now contains footage of a so-called magic light. Not the best footage, mind you, but it's a .vob file that I'd like to figure out how to convert into something I can put on youtube or something. (Help with that would be great, if anyone is still reading this!) Also, I plan on making a daytime trip to the road in hopes to look for any visible explenations, or talk to some people about the light (At least, anyone who doesn't look like they'd rip my head off for asking since I'm sure oxford residents hate college students), and I'd also like to try getting better footage of ""the light"" in action. Anyways, hope that interests anyone, and if anyone has any suggestions of something I should look into, lay them on me!

Ghostly  Airplane,"Tennessee, United States",Psychic / Medium,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Psychic / Medium :: Ghostly  Airplane

T his is my second true ghost story. I have so many experiences that I am going to try and submit them all. About thirty years ago, I was on my lunchbreak. I was returning back to work. I was driving down the street next to Centennial Park in Nashville when I spotted a giant white passenger airplane. It was hovering just over the trees. I had never seen anything that was that white. Instead of regular airplane wings, it had angel wings. Beside the wings were letters and numbers that were midnight blue. I could not remember any of them. I do remember how two of the passengers looked like. One was a girl, who was waving at people on the sidewalk below. The other was a man that was reading a paper. I realized that I was the only one seeing all this because the people walking on the sidewalk were completely unaware of what was right over their heads. Finally, a car was blowing at me from behind. I pointed at the airplane, but they continued to blow. I was backing up traffic. I was about three blocks from where I worked. I got back there as quick as I could and went on up to the fourteenth floor, which I worked on. I ran over to the windows and looked for the mysterious spooky airplane. I have never spotted that airplane again. Of course, all my co-workers thought I was crazy. But I know what I saw. I only wish that I had pulled my car over and parked. I could have continued to watch this supernatural angel-winged airplane.

Ghost in the Chair and the Writing on the Wall,"Colorado, United States",Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: Ghost in the Chair and the Writing on the Wall

T here was a time when I was growing up back in Indiana that we were remodelling part of the old house.  We'd peeled the wallpaper off the walls around the stairway that went up to my bedroom and had just put on a fresh layer of spackling compound to level-off and even-out the old plaster in preparation for gluing cork and mirror tiles on the walls the next day. (Yes, it was the 70's.)

In the middle of the night I got up to go downstairs to pee.  (Nice to remember that even as a kid I had to do that once in awhile.)

There was a rocking chair in my room that the family cat, Rascal, liked to sleep in at night.

With my glasses off everything was blurry and there was just the moonlight and the street light through the two windows at opposite ends of the room.  One window was at the top of the stairs.  I thought I was seeing Rascal's fuzzy white shape in that old wooden rocker, so I leaned down to pet him on my way to the steps.

But as I reached down, my hand passed through the fuzzy, furry white blob I'd thought was the cat and my fingertips touched the rough material of the cushion he would have been sleeping on.  There was a sudden cold tingling feeling, like an electrical charge, except it was really, really cold.  It chilled my hand to above the wrist almost immediately.  This is gonna sound weird, but, its outermost edges ""gathered blue"" as I looked at it.  My mind was still in shock from my hand passing through my cat, and I know it doesn't make sense now, but it felt like it was ""drawing blue"" out of the room and the tingling intensified till my elbow hurt.  Then, whatever it was took off through the back of the chair moving fast, like I'd startled it.

It shot across the room and over to the staircase, an elliptical blob of bluish-white light that never touched the floor, but rolled in the air, slightly churning as it moved.

Stupid as it might sound, I chased after it.  It shot over to the stairwell, then down, keeping itself above the steps and sort of leaning into the wall until it finally passed through the wall and out of the house somewhere just shy of the other side of the landing.

I was still at the top of the stairs, and looked out the window and down, trying to see if I could find it moving out of the house.  I caught sight of it briefly, just a glimpse as it darted above the hedges and tomato plants in the side yard, then suddenly shot upwards, out of sight.  As it moved up, it seemed to peel backwards, like it was turning itself inside out, just before it disappeared.  When I stopped seeing it, it was about ten feet above my head, and almost halfway across the neighbor's back yard.  That thing moved fast! and weird....

I kept watching the sky for few minutes to see if there was anything else out there, till I really had to pee.  So, I went down the stairs and over to the bathroom to relieve myself... then went back to bed.  It was awful late in the night and I didn't figure anyone would want to be woken up just to hear about something that was already over, so I went back to bed.

When I woke up the next day and walked down the stairs, the spackling compound was dried and would have been ready for setting tile -- except now it was all scratched up.  But it wasn't like claw marks, which you would have expected to follow a straight path or make curving arcs, lifting the compound, if it really was the stupid cat and I'd just imagined everything else in the moonlight... no, these marks were more like a series of badly drawn lightning bolts.  It looked like they'd been ""squiggled"" into the compound.  They were all jaggedy, in short -almost methodical- bursts. Like someone was writing something but forgot how to use the alphabet.

But the really weird thing goes like this: The spackling compound wasn't dragged through...  I don't know how to explain this, but hang in there with me for a minute.  Imagine dragging your finger through some cake frosting (that's pretty much the consistency of spackling compound) to make the letter Z like Zorro would.  Notice how the frosting is displaced outwards by the movement of your finger.  Notice how the heaviest amount of frosting ends up in a little pile pushed at the end where you lifted your finger away from the cake to lick the frosting... notice how the frosting lifted up with you to follow your finger as long as it could before seperating and falling back slightly.  Now here's the really weird thing: with these markings in the wall, THERE WAS NO HEAVIEST EDGE OR END, anywhere!  Period.  All along all those little jagged letter-ish shapes the displacement was even, as if you'd started at the center (of each axis) and pushed evenly outwards to displace the mud (that's what you call spackling compound).  Even.  Smooth.  Uniform displacement. Everywhere. Plus, when I said these things were ""letter-ish,"" I meant that they were of fairly uniform height and consistent width, prety much like you were scribbling something down in a hurry.  (Yeah, I know, alien spaceghost graffiti from the other side.  But, this really could have been some kind of writing, it looked that intentional.  Know what I mean?)

Believe me, my brother and I studied these markings a long time, twisting around to look at these things from all angles, even holding up a mirror to look at them backwards, before we had to smear on the glue and tile them over.

Dreams of Haunted Places,Canada,Old Hags / Night Attacks / Sleep Paralysis,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Old Hags / Night Attacks / Sleep Paralysis :: Dreams of Haunted Places

I sometime encounter ghosts in my dreams.  Theses dreams always leave me freaked out especially if I'm scared about the experience. Some of my dreams are reoccurring.  In some dreams I manage to help a spirit and other times I'm just so freaked out by the energy or the negative presence. I wake up and wonder why do I go there in my dreams, and think to myself upon waking ""oh no! not that dream again"".  I've had a few really scary dreams about ghosts I'll never forget. One was when I was pregnant.  I encountered a female ghost who tried to kill me by strangling me, and somehow I knew that she had actually killed herself in real life because she had suffered a loss of an unborn child.  Don't ask me how I knew this but I knew she was really upset and jealous of me because I was expecting and I woke up screaming ""No!"". Because I was trying to get her off of me, she had me down on the ground and I felt like she was on top of me while I woke up. I woke myself up yelling for my life. I was so shakened up that I told my partner about it. In real life I am clairvoyant about spirits and ghosts as well.

Little Girl That  Walks The House,American Samoa,Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: Little Girl That  Walks The House

T o tell you the truth I've never seen what I'm about to write... but my mom and the neighbor did and I totally believe them. I lived in a house that was divided into three parts and there were three families that lived there. We happened to live in the smallest part of it. You have to remember that I was about 8 years old at the time, so I never really thought much about the house. But even when I was 8, I still felt a small vibe in the bathroom. Now our house was just a living room, kitchen, my room and the bathroom, all in that order and very small. In the bathroom there was a small slant in the celling that was meant to be there, but it made you feel just... scared. In the bathroom, there was no shower because of the slant but the bath looked almost like an old style kind of bath. Let me tell you what my mom and the neighbor saw. On the stairs of the house, Dana (the neighbor) and my mom saw a little girl around 12 years old. They said that she was dressed in old fashioned clothings with little boots. They didn't get a bad feeling from this girl. At around 3:00 in the morning, my mom also heard a ball bouncing from that girl. Dana also saw a bunch of ghost cats. They did get a BAD vibe from hearing a man's foot steps up stairs. Loud. But the man soon left. It was just a plain creepy house!

A Friday Night Sitting,"Washington, United States",Apparitions / Voices / Touches,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Apparitions / Voices / Touches :: A Friday Night Sitting

F irst some background... I am from Washington state and lived on the coast till I married, my grandparents lived in a very small town called New London it can be found outside of Hoquiam on Highway 101 heading north. My grandmother was a medium and had sitting's each Friday night in my grandparents living room this house was built by my grandfather and Great uncle from a Logging Bunk house it was two stories and had two bedrooms and a one car garage.

My grandfather built (and held several patents) band saws that were used thought out the west coast and Canada in big Saw mills. I believe there are still some of them around. He had a very large machine shop, with office attached, that he made the saws in so he needed a very large driveway for trucks to be able to come and go in, the drive lead up to the house, and was all gravel, so when someone drove in to the driveway there would be no way that you could miss the crunch of the gravel from the tires going over it when it got to the house and at night with the light of 2 big street lights flooding it with light it was very unlikely anyone would be able to get to the house without being seen.

The sittings were not something that you had to pay to be invited to, it was just word of mouth and being there at 7 pm in the evening and staying till it was over.

This took place on a fall evening, I remember that because it was when the sun was setting earlier again, and it was dark before the evening started. There was some 9 maybe 10 people that had come that night, my father and myself included. The hall way light was turned on so that the back of the house was lighted if someone needed to take a break they would not have a problem. The drapes that were over the front window and the side window looking over the deck that lead to the front door was left open to let the light from the street lights come into the living room.

Right at 7:30 the sitting started as any normal Friday night...  Two people had come in for just a very short time and it was like there was a lull then from outside we heard a car turn into the driveway and come slowly up the drive and stop right under the window. I wanted to get up and see who it was but my dad shook his head no at me and whispered to sit still.... the engine turned off and first one car door opened then two more opened and closed with the first one you could hear foot steps walking in the gravel then nothing when they walked across the grass to the side walk and then up the wooden stairs and walking across the deck to stop right at the window. My dad got up to go and open the door but looked out the window to see who was there first and stood stock still... my grandfather took one look at him and then turned to look out the front window where the car was at.... or should I say should have been....  there was nothing there.... after what most likely was only a few seconds but felt like a lot longer it was like they seen what they wanted and had turned back around, walked back down the steps and opened the car doors closed them started the engine and backed slowly out of the drive way. Every one of us that night heard the same things we all stood up to watch out the front window... there was nothing there.

A Get Together With Friends,"Washington, United States",Poltergeists / Physical Manifestations,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Poltergeists / Physical Manifestations :: A Get Together With Friends

W hen I was a child, my father would invite neighborhood families to the house for the evening.  Where other families would just play games like cards or board games, my father would come up with the idea of rocking the table about half way thought the evening just to have something different to do.

The night that I remember most clearly was when I was about 7 years old it was decided that I would rock the table with him.  The table we would use was the dinning room table.  This table was a very large cherry wood table that set 12.  As we where a family of 10 We lived in a large 5 bedroom house on 40 acres of property, the rooms were all very large and the dinning room was no exception.

That night we put all the chairs back against the wall to have them out of the way then moved the table to the middle of the room. I was standing at one end of the table with my palms on the table at about elbow length from the end of the table with my body not touching it, my father stood at the other end and also put his hands on the table at elbows length or more onto the table also where he in no way touched the table other than just the palms of his hands.   It was quite in the room as my dad told me to clear my mind and only think over and over again ""if there is someone here rock the table"" that's what I did. It was slow at first but the table kind of moved just a little bit like some one was pushing against it as if they were getting up from a chair. Then the table started raising up off the floor from my father's side of the room I might add there was no way that I could have done this to have it tip towards me and with him only having his palms on the table there was no way that he could do it either...  He started to ask questions that would be yes and no answers he said if it's No, rock one time, if it's Yes, rock two times.  This question and answers only went on till he thought it would be fun to see if we could get them to put the table up on one leg and go around in a circle on that one leg... he asked if they would do that for us tonight...  The answer to that question was a bone jarring, Yes.

The table started rocking back and forth very hard for just a few seconds till it got up so far that my dad had to move to the side of the table to keep his hands on it.  It was tipped up on the two legs on my side and stayed that way for all of 2-3 seconds then tipped up onto one of those legs and stood that way for a second or two and then started to turn slowly we had to walk around with it to keep our hands on it, at first it was just walking, then I had to run to keep up with it! Needless to say the neighbors that had come to the house were terrified of what they were seeing as never once did my father have anything more in contact with the table then the palms of his hands.  And they knew that there was no way that I could have done what they were seeing.   The table was going to fast for us to keep up and I lost hold of it and let go and it came down on all four legs and just stood still, I can still see my step mother's face when she looked at her table to make sure it was ok after what it had been put though...

That was the only time I ever agreed to rock the table with my father with people from the neighborhood at the house.  As that kind of put me at a disadvantage to say the least with the kids I went to school with.

A Ghost is Attacking Me,Colombia,Old Hags / Night Attacks / Sleep Paralysis,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Old Hags / Night Attacks / Sleep Paralysis :: A Ghost is Attacking Me

I think a ghost is attacking me or I'm going crazy. The first incident happened about 2 years ago at around 7:00 am in the morning. Someone, who I thought was my dad, came in my room to wake me up so that I could open the gate, and he told me to watch over the house while he was gone. Well, my dad wears a black sweater and black sweat pants to bed so I didn't look at the face, I was so tired and mad that I had to get up at that time. When I got up to open the gate, I found my dad sleeping in his bed! That really pissed me off, so I woke him up to find out he had never come in my room. My sister has had a similar experience but it took the form of my step mom. It told her to get ready for school at 2:00 am in the morning, so she got up and took a shower.

Last year, on October 31st, at around 2:00 am, I woke up and when I closed my eyes to go back to sleep, I could feel someone in my bed! I tried to open my eyes but I was paralysed. This happened every night for about 2 months. In the past few weeks its been starting up again and its getting stronger, like one night, I woke up at 2:12 a.m. and I was awake for about 20 minutes. I was watching the clock and when I closed my eyes I started hearing loud whispering that sounded like a leaky sink, and before I could open my eyes it was on me and I tried to scream with all my might, but I only got some weird noises out. My sister heard them but didn't think anything of it. Now when it gets on me, I'm not even sure if its on me anymore, I dont feel it holding me down, I relax my muscles and still, I can't open my eyes. I've managed to open them a few times but I don't see anything. When I'm finally able to move, I stay awake, but sometimes it comes back on me or does whatever it seems to do.

ANYONE KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT THIS, PLEASE WRITE A MESSAGE, I DON'T LIKE WAKING UP IN THE MORNING TO FIND OUT TEN MINUTES LATER I STILL CAN'T MOVE.

Ghost by the Highway,"Georgia, United States",Apparitions / Voices / Touches,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Apparitions / Voices / Touches :: Ghost by the Highway

I was once driving back home from a long trip. I was driving from Texas going back to Georgia. It was about 2:30 AM EST and I finally made it back to the state of Georgia. As I first entered Highway 96 in Georgia doing about 55 miles per hour I noticed a glare on the left side of the road about half a mile up. As I got closer to the glare it appeared more misty then finally clear. The object was in the form of a woman mid-aged but it had no legs. It appeared to have full body but stopped at the legs. The object did not appear to notice me pass by. Again, I was doing about 55 miles per hour so it was a quick glipse but I know I saw it. I even looked in my rear view mirror to confirm the object, and yes, it was the real deal. No I was not sleepy at the time. No I do not do drugs and No I do not drink and drive. This experience was 100% real. If you ever get the chance drive on Highway 96 EAST in GA and see what you find.

Silver Horseshoes,"Colorado, United States",Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: Silver Horseshoes

A handful of odd things happened back in the house I grew-up in, in Indiana.  I've already told you about the ghost in the chair (and the writing on the wall).

Sometime after that incident, my mother, my brother Chuck, and I were in the living room, in the late evening, watching television when a loud noise startled us.  It was a loud clanging kind of sound from down in the basement.

We had a really musty old basement -- half of it was a dirt floor crawlspace that opened into the poured concrete part of the basement.  It was just a storage area, full of old paint cans, fishing tackle, tools, storm windows, a big freezer that usually held a whole hog and a side of beef we'd pick-up twice a year to live off of.  There was a sump pit that the washer drained into and the furnace and hot water heater were down there.

The ""ceiling"" of it was just the exposed floor joists of the ground floor rooms -- one of which we were sitting in when he heard this loud clanging noise from the basement.  Startled, we went down to see what was going on.

The stairs had no backs (just the treads, no risers).  Our dog, a big German Shephard, was always afraid to go down in that basement.  She'd almost pitch a fit to have to go past that door to get out in the backyard.  But there we were, me, and Mom, and Chuck, standing on those openbacked basement stairs looking at the cement floor, where a single horse shoe was laying.  The cement was chipped were it hit.  It was spraypainted silver.

We had a silver pair and a red pair for playing horshoes, and these were real ones -- heavy.  We kept them hanging on a pair of nails driven into one of the exposed floor joists.  As we stood there, the second silver one fell onto the first.

That was startling.  Freaky weird.  Just as it happened I saw a white-ish line shoot up from the horshoe already on the floor.  Nobody else saw it.  But to me, it looked just like some kind of shape reached up and tapped the other one, sort of like looking at a thin man sideways.  I can remember us talking back and forth about how maybe us running through the dining room to the stairs might have knocked it off the nail....

But we were on the stairs when it fell.... and the nail it fell from was still just like it ought to be.  A big 10 penney nail stuck in at about a 45 degree angle.  The horseshoes would have had to have ""walked"" up the nail and gotten themselves over the big nail head.

My brother was taller than the rest of us and he grabbed the nail to see if it was loose or could be twisted.  It was tight as ever.

We hung the silver ones back up on the same nail they fell from and went back upstairs.  I think we spent the rest of the evening waiting to hear if they were gonna fall again, or not.

They never fell again that I know of.  And it had been at least a month since anyone had played horshoes -- so they'd been on that nail a long time.

The House In Cypress,"California, United States",Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: The House In Cypress

W hen I was in the 4th grade, my family moved into a house in Cypress, California. On the outside it looked like any other on the block, but on the inside it was anything but normal.  The layout of the upstairs had been changed by the previouse owner and went from a 4 bedroom to one large loft.  But there was something else in the house that for the longest time only us kids encountered.

On the first day as we moved in, we watched a spice rack that was at the back of the counter, It slid across the tiled counter and over the lip at the end of it and crashed to the floor.  Our parents did not believe us when we told them, they just thought one of us had done it ourself.  But as the weeks went by, things continued.

The clock in the kitchen would periodically jumpoff the wall and land on the refidgerator 3 feets away, never once did it hit the ground.  The T.V. and Stereo would turn on by them selves tunded to a station with nothing but static.  Three to four times a week we would hear scratching noises on the east side of the house, and there were no bushes or trees on that side.  My little sister and I would every so often hear someone moving around in the upstairs closet when no one else was up there.  My parents however thought this was just all our imaginations, until one night.

My sister Kina and I, along with two other of my sisters, were up in her part of the loft one night (which was on the East side of the house) watching T.V. We started to hear music from the music boxes on the other side of the loft where my other two sisters beds were.  They decided to go see what was going on and as soon as they turned the corner by the stairs, that is when it happened.

From outside Kinas window a voice called out to her, in a scratchy whisper, it called her name over and over.  By the time it called her name the 3rd time we were already heading down the stairs, followed by my other two sisters.  They were running because as they got to the music boxes, it stopped playing.

We ran to our dad and after telling him what happened he decided to go check it out.  We followed him up the stairs to the window all of us moving as one.  But you could have heard a pin dropped with the silence that followed him opening the curtains.  On the window was two smeared handprints on the outside and hanging from the beam of the roof was a noose.  My dad thought someone had tried to break in and called the police.

After they arrived and checked the house and the surrounding property, they found nothing.  They told my dad that no one could have gotten to that side of the house from the outside, only from the inside was it possible.  That is when they informed my dad what had occured at the house years before.  It seemed that the owners, prior to the one we got the house from, had a teenage daughter.   One day when they had come home early they discovered her body swinging from a noose from that very window, and on the outside of the window was two smeared hand prints. Thats all my dad needed to hear.  We moved out that week, realizing that for some reason she was still there and did not want any other children in that house.

From time to time I go by that House in Cypress and alway get the feeling something is watching me.  But to this day when I hear something outside the window I hesitate to look, in fear something may be looking back.

A Little Boy,"Tennessee, United States",Apparitions / Voices / Touches,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Apparitions / Voices / Touches :: A Little Boy

I n February 2006, I was in a park near downtown Nashville Tennesse and I saw a little boy about 4-5 years old. He was wearing bloody pajamas and looked like he had been crying. He vanished behind a mound of dirt.

I saw him from a distance of about 10 feet, it was broad daylight (11 a.m.) and he looked very real, not vaporous/transparent.

I found out later about 2 years ago a little 6 years old boy had been murdered by his mom's boyfriend. His body was dumped on that pile of dirt.

Attack on my Auditory Senses,"Virginia, United States",Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: Attack on my Auditory Senses

I n 2003 I had a girlfriend who had just moved into a manufactured house. I pretty much lived with her. My life was miserable at the time (just to add). As the weeks went by she told me that she thought that the house was haunted, that she kept hearing noises and seeing things out the corner of her eyes. I just chalked it all up to her over active imagination. As more weeks went by I started to believe what she was saying. The house just seemed like it was somewhat active. I too was hearing these noises at night and seeing things in my peripheral vision, more so then at my  parents house or just most anywhere else.

But yet I was still skeptical until a series of 3 nights, all 3 nights in a row. It wasn't unusual for me to stay with her 4 and 5 nights in a row but something was different about these 3 nights. We headed for bed around 10:00PM on a Tuesday night. For some reason this night, I was having trouble sleeping, my girl was asleep in minutes. At around 11:00PM I began to hear a very faint but strange noise. It sounded as if someone was slamming a very big metal door shut and open shut and open over and over again. You know like one of those big dungeon doors from an old medieval castle. Not unlike someone smashing a sledge hammer against a steel beam. Very strange I thought but very faint, as if in the distance. I tried to ignore it but it wouldn't go away and as the time was passing it was slowly getting louder as if it was approaching me or something. About an hour passed and I was relieved that it went away. I told my girlfriend about it the next morning but she had heard nothing. Wednesday evening more of the same, we went to sleep around 10:00 PM but yet I still found it hard to sleep and the noise persisted this night too but was noticebly louder than the night before. I even awoke my girlfriend to ask her if she could hear this strange sound and she looked astonished, she had no clue what I was talking about. I was thinking that I was starting to go crazy or something. It was strange because the noise only persisted with my eyes closed and would slowly get louder and dissipate within about an hour. I thought maybe it was all some weird dream or something, I didn't know what to think.

Then came Thursday evening as we were heading for bed I became sort of apprehensive about trying to sleep but I went along to bed anyways with my girl. Around the same time as the nights before. At first I was relieved that this night seemed quiet. But then it started, this night was different then the first two. The noised started significantly louder this time. The noise pierced my ears. The noise was so loud that it made my whole head physically rattle everytime it repeated itself. This time I opened my eyes and the noise continued louder and louder. My ears began to hurt very intensely with each clash of metal. How could this be I thought, how could she still be sleeping, it's as loud as a freight train. Then I looked out her bedroom door and froze solid. The noise seized. What looked like a small human figure. More of a black mist seemed to dissipate. I woke my girlfriend and explained to her what happened. She looked at me like I was nuts. She had heard nothing.

After this night I never experienced anything like this again at her house. Something about those 3 nights was not right. I know a couple of things though. I wasn't dreaming, that noise actually caused me physical pain (in my ears), something was in the doorway of her room, I never again doubted her when she said she saw or heard something. For the rest of my life I will never forget those 3 nights.

15 Years of Terror,"California, United States",Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: 15 Years of Terror

W hen I was 8 years old my Mom and Dad purchased a home located in Burlingame, California.  They got a great deal on the house and were thrilled at its location, and the town.

I recall the first time I entered the house I said to my Mom ""It is so dark in here."" My Mother reassured me that with a little paint and new drapes it would be bright and sunny. I think that the darkness I noticed wasn't just because of the dark walls and drapes, there was something much darker hidden in the seams of the house.  This darkness didn't stay hidden for long.

Before we moved our belongings into the home my Dad, and one of his friends, Dick, went to the house to refinish the hardwood floors.  They were in for a challenging set of experiences.  When they turned on the sander the radio would blast, when they turned off the radio the light would go on. Then the electricity would shut off. They checked the fuses, but none of them were burned out.

My Dad called the power company, the man who came out said there was nothing wrong with the connection from the power pole to the house. He told my Dad that he needed to call an electrician.  The electrician witnessed the strange and inexplicable relation between unrelated switches and the response from remote locations throughout the house. The electrician told my Dad that the entire house needed to be rewired.

To their surprise after this announcement all the electrical appliances and lights worked as expected. All returned to normal operation at that time. This stunt repeated many times over the years. We just had to wait it out because there was nothing wrong with the fuses, fuse box, the connection to the power pole. There was no technical explanation. I will say that being in a totally dark house due to the actions of invisible intruders was quite terrifying. We were at their mercy, and they had little to no mercy.

After we moved into the house we immediately noted that at times it sounded as if someone was walking across the floor, or there would be what sounded like knocking on various doors throughout the house. The back door would open and slam closed, which would be followed by what sounded like footsteps coming up the stairs.

My parents explained to me that these sounds were the sounds of the house settling. Often when I went to bed at night I would hear heavy breathing right by my face. My parents told me this was what the water heater sounded like at night when it was heating the water.

I would hear my Mother call, and when I answered she would say she did not call me, and visa versa.

I often found long auburn hairs in my bedroom. I couldn't figure this out. I didn't know anyone with auburn hair.

My parents became acquainted with the next door neighbors. They commented to Mom and Dad that they hoped that they lived there longer than other people that had moved in. The house had always been sold, never rented, but it was rare for any family to live there more than 3 months. The neighbors had lived next door for over 20 years.

There were times when I woke up with someone holding on to my ankles and pulling me off the end of the bed.  This terrified me. When I told my parents they assured me that I was only having a nightmare.

I woke up in the mornings to find pieces clipped from my hair. This left short jagged pieces I couldn't style. My Mom told me this was from the pin curls I used.

One afternoon I was in my bedroom and couldn't shake the feeling that someone was staring at me.  This gave me the creeps, so I decided to go out to the living room. In that I felt so uneasy, I stepped down on the first step in front of the door and reached around the corner to turn off the light.  When I turned off the light I saw a young woman sitting on the bed right next to where I had been sitting. She had long auburn hair. She was transparent.  I didn't believe in ghosts. My parents had told me over and over again there was no such thing. Now I was faced with the terrifying reality of a ghost sitting on my bed.

I ran to the front bathroom, slammed and locked the door. Then it dawned on me that if she was a ghost and what they say about ghosts was true she could walk through the wall and I would be locked inside with her.  I unlocked the door and ran to the living room in the front of the house.

In the morning I told my parents about my experience.  They exchanged glances and then they told me that they knew that the house was haunted. The ghost I described to them is the one they called ""Florence."" It took them about 3 years to believe the house was haunted.  They didn't believe it until they had exhausted themselves by sneaking through the house trying to find the intruders making all the noises, and never finding anything. Then one night when they had just gotten into bed, turned off the lights, and above the end of their bed were two floating heads staring at them.

They both saw these apparitions, and could not deny what they saw.

This put them on a trek of using an Ouija board to try to communicate with the ghosts. Knowing what I do now about the response to this board by earth bound spirits I am certain this practice only made things worse. There were many ghosts. I only saw two fully manifest apparitions, but my parents saw and experienced many more. I saw ""things"" but only 2 specific ones.

It was a common experience to see items, such as books, fly across the room. One time my Mom was taking a nap on the couch in the living room. The couch seemed to be shaking. She opened her eyes to discover that the couch was being transported by floating across the room with her on top of it.

One could explain doors opening and closing by themselves being due to not being latched properly and a breeze caused it to open and close.  This explanation could not be applied to the sliding door between the 2nd and 3rd bedrooms. This sliding door often slammed open or closed.  This was very unsettling.

Quite a few times my parents came into my room in the middle of the night to see why I was screaming. I was not aware of screaming. As far as I knew I was sound asleep. They would describe the screaming as if I had ""seen bloody heads rolling across the floor.""

There were times my parents acted out of character. They would be much harsher than one would expect.

Shortly before my Mom passed away she told me that the change of life made her ""strange."" I asked her what she meant and she told me that one time she was chatting across the picket fence with our elderly neighbor. She said that it took all her strength to force herself to go back into our house without attacking and strangling the neighbor.  I told her, ""Mom, that wasn't the change of life - it was the ghosts. The ghosts made them say and do things that were out of character. I could see ""it"" in their eyes and their mannerisms - that they were ""different"", not themselves.

I experienced times when I was attacked, pushed, and man-handled by the ghosts. I told my parents, and they told me that I was letting my imagination run away with me.

Their invalidation of my experiences made life very difficult for me as there was no where to turn for help.

Family and friends that visited were often treated to a ghost experience from simple footsteps and door knocking to having their blankets pulled off of them in the middle of the night by unseen hands.

One time my Aunt was at our house for my birthday party. It was too late for her to drive all the way home, but she didn't want to sleep in the house. She slept out in our travel trailer with my teenage slumber party.

One time we were watching television when Hans Holzer and Sybil Leek were visiting San Francisco. They were ghost hunters. They announced that if anyone thought their house was haunted that they would be glad to come out and get rid of the ghosts. I begged my parents to call them.  They didn't want to because they didn't want anyone in the area to know the house was haunted. They said that when they sold the house that such information would prevent them from getting a good price.  I was so hopeful and then crestfallen.

When my parents retired and put the house on the market the ghosts became especially active. We had occupied the house for 15 years, and I think the ghosts were pretty happy with the arrangement.

He told my Mom that he wanted to move into the travel trailer so they didn't have to be concerned with constantly cleaning and preparing for the stream of realtors streaming through the house with potential buyers.

Then one morning my Dad announced that he was lowering the price on the house by a considerable amount. We all tried to discourage him from doing so since they were counting on the profit from the sale to buy retirement property and perhaps build a home. He wouldn't listen to our arguments.

Mom and I were sitting in the kitchen while Dad walked the new owners out to their car. Mom and I heard the back door open and slam closed. We heard footsteps coming up the back steps. We got up together and looked down the hall to the stairway. We could still hear the footsteps ascending the stairs, but there was no one to be seen.

After they moved all of their things out of the house, handed over the keys, and had left the property for good, Dad confided why he insisted on moving into the trailer and lowering the price on the house.

The night before they moved out into the trailer my Dad was startled awake by a hand over his mouth and nose. He was being suffocated by the man ghost, who we had come to call Dave.

Dad was a strong guy, but he said that it took all the strength he had to wrestle away from the grip of the ghost.

We heard that the first renter in the house was a minister. I was elated thinking that a minister might pray the ghosts out of the house. The minister moved out almost as soon as he had moved in.  After a series of short term renters the house was replaced by an apartment building.  Neighbors told my parents that the house had been moved.  I don't know if the house was moved, and if it was moved I wondered if the ghosts go with the house or haunt the apartment building built on the site.

I know I would never want to go back and find out for myself.

My Mother Saw Ghosts,"Virginia, United States",Family / Friends Visits,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Family / Friends Visits :: My Mother Saw Ghosts

W hen I was an infant my family and I lived overseas. I think we were in Bulgaria at the time... My parents were out for the night while my brother and I were being babysat. Long story short, my mother woke up in the middle of the night to see relatives of hers -who were deceased- telling her to call home (I think there were 3 of them). She told me that she waited a few moments to make sure she was not dreaming... with them still telling her to call home... well she woke my father up and of course the ghosts were gone. They phoned home and the babysitter checked on my brother and I only to find me not breathing from an apparent viral infection that made my throat swell up. I was taken to the hospital and the doctors said any later I could have died from asphyxiation. She tells me the same story every time without adding or leaving out any information. I believe her without a doubt.

My Ghost Story,Canada,Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: My Ghost Story

I 'm a big believer of spirits and supernatural things and I'm not a professional, just a teenage girl wanting to tell my story.

When I was young, like around 2-4, I lived in this big family house. All my family lived together, my grandmother, grandfather, two uncles, me and my mom. I can still remember every detail about the house, the vents on the floor had pretty details, the carpet was red and there was lots of stairs. When I was little my mom would try to put me to bed or take me to the bathroom, and I would scream and cry and tell her over and over there was a lady upstairs. At night I would crawl out of my bed and sleep on the stairs until the adults went to bed. My mom was worried and took me to the doctors, she probably thought I was a psycho 2 years old, but the doctor said ""how could a little kid that young lie!"".

Time passed and my mom and I moved out of the house, meanwhile the rest of my family stayed. We moved away and only two years later, we moved back into the same HOUSE. I was older around 5 or 6. and I remember going upstairs, still scared, but I was snooping for my birthday presents, I opened my closet door and the lady was standing there looking at me, I turned around, started running to the stairs and, as I was turning the corner to head down the stairs, I saw her spread her arms and try to lean over me. I fell and slid all the way down he stairs. After that I would sleep in my own room alone. I felt like I was being watched. The doors would open and close. No one believed me, my grandma tried to say ""maybe it was your guardian angel"".

Then one night, my mom woke up at 3:30 in the morning, she said there was a flash of light. She looked at the clock, it was 3:30, when she laid back down and looked up the lady was hovering over on top of her! My mom just put the covers over her head like a little kid. That's when she started to believe me. After that our dog stared barking all the time and growling for no reason, we would hear foot steps and things would open and close.

So after a while, my grandparents moved out to an apartment building for older people and my uncle moved out. We called a priest to come bless the house, but we moved out before he had a chance to come. The next people who moved in had 5 children. My grandma and me went back to check on our mail and we started talking to the lady. She started telling us about weird things that have been happing, like her baby swing was off and when she came back down stairs, it was on maximum speed. I haven't been back to the house since I was like 6 years old, but sometimes I like to drive past the house just to see it. I do miss the house but I wonder what the lady wanted. I don't think she liked kids but you're probably thinking ""you were so young, how can you remember?"". I can remember everything to a T.

Through a Child's Eyes,"Kentucky, United States",Children Who See Spirits,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Children Who See Spirits :: Through a Child's Eyes

M y mother, sister, nephew and I stopped on the side of the road, which happened to be at a family cemetery, so my mom could turn off her cell phone. This was on halloween night. My 2 year old nephew looked up at the grave yard and said ""Nanny, there's three babies"" and starts to open the car door. My mom asked him where and he pointed over toward a couple grave stones. He then started to motion for them to come to where he was, and said ""come here babies lets play"". Well, I was starting to get a little freaked out needless to say, but what really caused the hair to stand up on the back of my neck is when he looked at us and said ""over there"", and pointed straight to my grandmother's grave. Out of the blue, he said the nickname ""PJ"" (which is my brother, my nephew's daddy). My grandmother used to always call my brother PJ, never have we ever called him that and no way could that child have heard it anywhere, because no one ever calls my brother that but my grandma, and she passed away. At that moment my mother was like ""Daylan, where did you hear that name"" and he said her. He pointed at her grave and then said ""I guess thats my daddy!"". I burst out in tears and I know deep down in my heart, that child saw something that we couldn't.

Ellie's Visitation,Australia,Family / Friends Visits,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Family / Friends Visits :: Ellie's Visitation

E llie is my other-half's favourite Auntie. She's in her mid-to-late 60's. Ellie's husband, Terry, died four years ago and she has lived alone ever since. Recently, Ellie has been in hospital with an e-Coli infection and as part of her treatment, the doctor's put her into an induced coma for a week. It was pretty touch-and-go with the prognosis not necessarily being positive. Thank heavens, Ellie recovered and is now at home. Weak ... but almost back to her old self.

At any rate, my other half and I got in the car and went to pay a call on her yesterday.  I am a believer in _most_ things paranormal, my other-half: a skeptic! As Ellie had been in a coma, I was interested to see if she'd had a NDE. When questioning Ellie about the time she was in the coma, she could not recall anything *peculiar*. However, the conversation then turned to ghostie's ... Ellie relayed the story about her sister, Lynne, now dead these past two years.

Lynne died of a heart-attack which was completely unexpected, and a great shock to Ellie, as Lynne had no prior history of heart problems.  Ellie and Lynne were great friends and Lynne's demise has left Ellie a little lost. She misses her sister greatly.  There was a photo of Lynne on a little table in Ellie's lounge room. One evening, while Ellie was watching the idiot-box, Lynne's photo crashed to the floor and the frame broke. It was winter, all doors/windows were closed - in other words, there was no wind to blow the photo over.  Paul, Ellie's son, fixed the frame [which made Ellie very happy as she liked the frame a lot] and the photo was placed back in its spot on the table. Yet again, while watching the TV, this time with Paul, Lynne's photo crashed to the floor a second time. Jokes were made about Lynne **not liking the position of the photo, she was always nosey and couldnt see enough from that position.** We all make quips like this from time to time. Lynne's photo was put on the wall, where it has remained without incident, ever since.  But that is NOT the story I want to tell you. It merely forms the back-drop for the real tale.

Before commencing the tale, Ellie prefaced it with ""I don't believe in this stuff."" I didn't imagine Ellie was talking about ghosts!  Ellie could be a soldier ... as soon as she gets up, she gets dressed and makes her bed. No cuppa first - unlike me who can't function without caffeine first thing in the morning.  Apparently, Ellie follows this regime EVERY morning without fail. I make a point of this because, by the time Ellie has dressed and made her bed, she is OBVIOUSLY wide-awake.  This particular morning, just *after* Lynne's death, Ellie followed her usual morning routine. Ellie dressed, made her bed, and then exited her bedroom, to make a cuppa and go about her business.  When Ellie came out of her bedroom, she walked into the hallway and saw Lynne ""come through the window in a flowing white dress"". Lynne was with ""some man"". Ellie, quite taken aback, she knew that her sister was deceased, spoke to Lynne.  ""Lynne, what are you doing here?""  Lynne said, ""I just came to see if you were alright."" The man didn't say anything, he just stood there.  Ellie then got quite upset. She was crying and visibly distressed. Helga, Ellie's next door neighbour came in for a cuppa and asked Ellie ""What's the matter?"" Ellie explained.

Now, Ellie didn't say how Lynne and the man left, whether they walked out or just disappeared. She also didn't say how long the visitation lasted. Ellie wasn't scared, she was shocked and upset because she knew full well that Lynne shouldn't have been in her house because she had only recently died.  I said to Ellie, ""You are very lucky! Lynne managed to come back to let you know she loves you and is watching over you."" Millions of people on the planet would love ONE last conversation with their departed love ones. I can think of some people I'd dearly love to have one last conversation with.  On the drive back home, I surmised to my other half that the man was actually Ellie's husband, Terry. This wasn't particularly well received by my boyfriend. Reason? Apparently Lynne and Terry didn't get on very well in life, he couldn't see them visiting Ellie together.  I disagree. I believe that once people have died, all these petty little personality problems dissipate. I think it was Terry there with Lynne. Ellie's husband and sister paying one last visit.  Maybe Lynne needed some help in *focusing* to visit Ellie and Terry came along to lend a hand. They both had one thing in common, a love for Ellie.  I think they put their differences aside so that Lynne could let Ellie know that she was OK and still cared for her. I also think the reason the **man** was indistinguishable and didn't speak, was because it was Lynne's *mission* to contact Ellie, he was just there in support of Lynne.

Am I a Supernatural Magnet?,Sweden,A Haunted Life,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: A Haunted Life :: Am I a Supernatural Magnet?

I 'm 17 years old now and I'm pretty much the only one in my family who believes in the supernatural. My parents and everyone else keeps telling me that it's just nonsense but I know that's not the truth. I have several experiences throughout my life and I thought I'd tell you about them.

I'm from Sweden and my dad grew up in a village up north. The summer house we have there is sort of on the country side and it was build somewhere between the 1920s and the 1930s. My grandparents raised my dad and his brothers there. My grandpa passed away before I was ever born so I don't remember him although I was very close to my grams, and apparently I was her favorite grandchild,  probably because I'm the youngest cousin. She died in 1997 and I remember how upset I was about it but since I was young I got over it quite soon.

A couple of years later when I was around 10 or 11, during one easter holiday when my dad and I were having lunch, downstairs of the kitchen, something strange happened. I suddenly heard a person laughing and immediately looked at my dad since the two of us were the only ones in the house and asked ""What's so funny?"". My dad gave me a strange look and replied ""I thought you were the one laughing."" My dad's the type of person who always has a good joke in store but there was something about the look on his face that freaked me out, but we never heard the laugh again, although, when I think about it now afterwards, I think it was grams laughing at us.

The second experience in that house was one summer when I was around 13 or 14 years old. I was in the upstairs attic which was turned into a bedroom. I was sitting on the bed drawing. My dad and the others were outside working. I was lost in my thoughts, but snapped out of them when I heard our old coocoo clock making noises, and this is a clock that hasn't worked in decades. It went on for about a minute or two and then stopped. Feeling myself getting scared I ran outside as fast as I could.

Since then I've had a few other experiences every now and then such as the TV switching channels on its own. Rocking chairs rocking when empty and I've heard footsteps walking up and down and throughout the rooms when I've been alone. I know it either my grams or my grandpa and that makes me less scared, it's actually sort of comforting knowing that they're around, looking after us.

When I was 13 my dad and I moved to Africa, or more specifically Namibia, where we lived for two and half years because of his work. We lived in a large house, roughly around 300 meters square, if I'm not mistaken, and since I was home from school earlier than my dad was home from work, I was often alone between 3:30 and 5:00, since our maid left around 3:00. During one of these occasions, I was in the TV area zapping through the channels, and our dog Mickey was lying on the couch with me when he suddenly jumped off the couch and started barking aggressively at something in front of him, but there was nothing there. He then ran downstairs to the front door and started barking again, but then after a while, he walked back to me, but kept looking behind him as if something was there.

When I was 15 I moved back to Sweden, but I moved in with my eldest uncle and aunt in a town up north because my dad was still in Namibia, and I didn't want to live in Stockholm with my mom. The first couple of months I lived there went on as normal and I never heard or saw anything. But that was soon about to change. It started one night when my aunt and uncle were taking these french lessons and I was home alone for about two hours. I was in the living room on the phone with a friend when I heard footsteps walking upstairs, into the hallway, through the living room where I was sitting, in through the kitchen and then disappeared without a trace. Guess how high my pulse was running?

The other thing happened when my two friends (let's call them Sally and Hannah) were sleeping over. We were in the basement because the temperature there was a lot more comfortable than upstairs. Sally had fallen fast asleep, but Hannah and I were still talking. We had locked the door and all windows and made sure we were the only ones there, but apparently we had been wrong. Around 11 pm I heard someone running fast upstairs and next thing I knew the knives and forks in the kitchen drawers were scrambling loudly and both Hannah and I were scared out of our wits. During another time when Hannah was at my place we were sleeping upstairs in a room with the door closed, it must have been sometime early in the morning, around 4:00 or 5:00, and both of us heard a door loudly slamming shut, but just once.

Although all of these experience were frightening, there is one that tops them all. I've always had a slight fear of the dark and sleep with lights on. I sleep in a room upstairs and my aunt and uncle have their bedroom downstairs and they always sleep with the door closed. I remember it clearly because that night I had a bad stomach ache so I didn't sleep very well. I woke up around 2:00 or 3:00 in the morning and when I turned around, I saw a man by my bed. I was too shocked to be scared and thought I was dreaming but realized I was very much awake, and I remember the man asking me if I had a stomach ache. I replied that I did and he bent forward whispering something I couldn't hear and next thing I knew, he was gone. I've never seen him since then and I've never told my aunt and uncle about what I saw because they would say it was my imagination or I was dreaming, but I knew what I saw. I don't think he wanted to harm me, but I don't understand why my aunt and uncle haven't felt or sensed any of these haunting before. Am I supernatural magnet?

Ghosts are Everywhere,Philippines,Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: Ghosts are Everywhere

M y father built me a house 5 years ago. It was located at the back of our house where my family is living. It was a present to me after I've made it to college. I didn't have any idea that it was not the dream house that I always wanted, but a house that I will later regret having. So after graduation, I lived in that house. It was very nice, like I'm living in an exclusive villa in an expensive subdivision.

I started to feel that I wasn't alone there, on the first night I slept there, while at deep slumber, my mobile phone alarm rang at exactly 3:00 am. I was still sleepy, so I reach for it with my hands while keeping my eyes closed, but I can't barely touch it, it's not at the place where I usually put it before going to bed. I slowly open my eyes, and then, to my surprise, I saw a lady in front of my bed, more like a sillouette of it, that is standing in front of me. I closed my eyes again and hid myself under they blankets.

I don't scream. I don't know what's up with me, but all I know is I'm not alone in my room... in my own house... in my own ""GHOST HOUSE"". Several times I experienced an old lady in my bathroom, children playing in my kitchen, a man hiding under the stairs and a lady in my room. I was always scared, all days of my life, it's like I'm living in hell, my life is consumed by my fears for years... when I realized it. They're not causing me harm. I think they are friendly and they just don't like me living alone in that house, thats why they come there and decided to stay, so I'm not alone. Day by day, different kinds of sigthings happen in that house, even my friends see them living with me at times. But I think they are not harmful, so I'm not scared anymore.

Believe it or not, not all ghosts you see out there can cause you harm. When I see them, I feel them and I smile at them... though sometimes I'm frigthened, these people who are not with us are helping me in some way.

A Night at the Lemp Mansion,"Illinois, United States",Ghost Tours & Haunted Hotels,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Ghost Tours & Haunted Hotels :: A Night at the Lemp Mansion

I spent a memorable night at The Lemp Mansion with my cousin, Cindy. It was memorable for me, because of the activity. Memorable for Cindy, because it firmly cemented in her mind that she would never return.

We stayed in the Charles Lemp suite.  Charles was the last of the Lemp family to take his own life in the Mansion.  Stories have circulated that he went downstairs and shot his dog then returned to his bedroom to shoot himself. This is not true.  He shot himself in the morning, on his bed.  He was the only member of the Lemp family to leave a note, and the fourth to commit suicide.  Three in the Mansion and a sister in her home in another St. Louis neighborhood.  Charles stated that when found, 'blame no one but me'. He left word that his last remaining brother, Edwin, was to have his body taken immediately, without any further preparation, and have it cremated, and to bury the ashes on his farm in St. Louis County.  The burial spot of Charles Lemps' ashes will never be known.  After the death of Edwin, all Lemp papers were burned along with valuable artwork and other items as requested by Edwin of his groundskeeper.

The night we stayed in Charles' suite, there was a party in the outside gazebo that lasted until around midnight.  All other suites were occupied for the night, so any investigation we might be able to do was limited.  We did wander about the house and took some photographs, did a little EVP work and took some video film.  There was nothing remarkable. At around 1:00 AM, we decided to call it a night.  I set up my video camcorder, which is not equipped with night vision, on a small table at the entrance to the room, pointing it toward a corner where there was a little light coming in through the window from outside. The guest table was set up in this corner and it included a coffeemaker, muffins and an ice bucket filled with ice, wine and orange juice. My reason for setting up the camera was to use it to record audio, as my tape recorder would make a rather loud ""click"" when the tape was finished, and the camcorder would simply shutdown after two hours.  I did not expect any video to be useful.

I was sleeping peacefully for about an hour, but awoke when my cousin began to move around.  She was hot in the room and finding it difficult to sleep.  We spoke for a few seconds, and I drifted back off... but not for long.  Almost immediately I was totally awakened by the sound of the ice in our ice bucket being literally tossed into the sink in the room.  It was very loud.  I asked Cindy, ""What was that?""  She replied, ""I think it was the ice"".  We could both see the bucket sitting on the table and knew it had not moved, but there was no mistaking the sound we heard.

After awhile, I was able to sleep again, though I don't believe Cindy ever did.

When I reviewed the two hours of video tape the next day, I noticed that the little light that came in through the drapes began to distort after awhile.  The camcorder self-focuses, and I assumed it was trying to do just that.  Gradually it began to get more and more distorted.  I continued to watch it, and reached the point in the tape where Cindy and I awoke just before the sound of the ice.  There it was, on the tape, the recording of the ice being thrown into the sink.  I was delighted to have caught it on tape!  It was loud and sounded exactly as it had the night before!

I recorded a copy of that portion of the tape onto DVD to keep it safe.  It was a very exciting night and a very good catch for me.  I since returned to Lemp and spent an hour closed up in Charles' room alone, attempting to record EVPSs through asking questions, but was unable to get a response.

I will not give up.  I continue to visit Lemp and will continue to try to contact Charles Lemp every chance I get.  I recommend anyone who can visit this top haunted America site to go!

I haven't uploaded the video yet.  I have another video from Lemp on youtube that is basically a walkthrough with downstairs dining and upstairs.  Then I walk around the upstairs corner to the corridor that leads back to the old vault door, and there appears to be a man at that door, or on it.  I have posted it on TAPS and some thought at first it was a man who stepped out of Charles' Lemp's suite, but that man looked out and then left through the main hallway door.  The door is painted black, it is a bit shiny and it is worn in places, but it's still very interesting, because it is at Lemp.  I have made quite a study of the Mansion and it's family.  I consider them very special.  I plan to ""master it"" and those who lived there.  I know it like the back of my hand, and even though the man at the door seems easy to debunk, it is still strange.  Anything can happen at that house.  I will add my youtube link.  The video I talk about in the story is hard, because I am having audio trouble on my computer and without it, the video isn't worth much.  But I got some of the problem solved, and it may be my program for retrieving video from my camera.  I am working on it.

Upstairs Pirate,United Kingdom,Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: Upstairs Pirate

I was 14 years old at the time of my first sighting/encounter of Ghosts. My father and stepmother had just purchased this old farm house outside the town of Ford right next to the river Arun in Sussex England. It had a lot of land with it, including river rights. Being the oldest boy with two brothers and three sisters to look after I was always the baby sitter when my parents went out. It was on one of those nights just after putting my brothers and sisters to bed that I could sense that I was being watched. I grabbed the poker, and after stoking the fire in the living room, I started checking all the rooms still holding the poker in my hand. After not finding anything or anyone, I calmed myself down, put the poker back by the fireplace and decided to go to bed.

Coming out of the living room I grabbed a hold of the banister and started making my way upstairs to my room. Climbing the stairs I looked up and then froze on the spot, there at the top was a transparent figure of a man dressed in pirates clothes looking right down at me. I could see right through him, as there was a picture on the wall behind him that was still visible. He was clean shaven and wore a bandana on his head a sword on his side, in his right hand was a wine goblet that he would drink from. He just stood there looking at me and then he smiled, his mouth was moving as if he was speaking to me but I could not hear him. He raised his goblet as if in toasting to me and drank from it. He then turned around and vanished through the wall.

When I told my dad of what I saw he just laughed and said that he also had a visit from him and that it wont be the last. He then went on to explain that the farm house we moved into use to be a favorite place for pirates to hide out in many years ago and still do.

The Footsteps,Philippines,Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: The Footsteps

G hosts are definitely not real. Those were my words said before we started our trip up to the mountains of Baguio city. A group of delegates from our grade school department were going to a leadership seminar in one of the most haunted places in the Philippines, Teachers camp. Plenty of ghosts stories come from that dreaded place where we were about to stay for six days. It was known for it's old age and the rumors that it was built on top of a war-related area. People see ghosts of war veterans and enemy soldiers kidnapping women. I thought I could never experience something like that, But I was wrong.

First day of the trip was fun, as I remember. We went biking around the park there and hung out in the hotel room of one of the delegates parents. I didn't even think about the place we were really supposed to stay, until of course I saw our hall in Teachers Camp. The camp was enormous, plenty of halls we could've stayed in. But of all of the halls we were assigned to, we were assigned to White hall, the oldest and the one in the worst condition. The floor would creak with every step and because of an opening between the ceiling and wall you could hear anything from chattering teachers to the bags of others dragged on the floor. Our toilets didn't even work well. So everyday I dreaded coming back to that hall at night.

The long awaited first night in our room finally came and as usual I didn't sleep well, I always have difficulty sleeping whether at home or a creepy camp. Room 109 was our assigned quarters, four other girls stayed in the room with me and they were comfortable with the place, just a bit disgusted at the counterproductive toilet. Anyway, As I was saying I didn't sleep well at all. I was awake until the hours of eleven desperately trying to sleep, of course I left the lights on fearing something might go bump that night. Finally, I fell asleep for around four hours and woke up again at 3:00 am. ""Screw sleep."" I thought. Luckily, I brought an interesting book from my sister. I read undisturbed yet still a bit paranoid for a few minutes. Until I heard something.

Footsteps. Faint yet coming closer. I stopped reading and waited if they'd actually get louder. They did. Before anything got any louder I actually peeked outside of my room, finding nothing, but the footsteps kept coming. Stronger and closer as it headed down from the stairs across the room. I went back to my bed and just stayed there, sitting upright, my ears eagerly taking in the footsteps. I was nervous, I tried to calm myself saying that there were late guests coming in. But then the footsteps reached the entrance of the room, so roughly that I felt the bed move whenever it sounded. I freaked and hid my head under the blanket. Hurriedly, reciting my prayers, while my friends slept soundly. I feared I'd see something that I'd remember for the rest of my life. The footsteps felt as if it was coming towards my bed. Then it stopped. I lifted enough courage to look up from my blanket. I saw a white shady figure with a somewhat bloodied face. It was only for a few seconds, until I finally got the urge to hide myself from it. I hid under the blanket again. The footsteps ensued but this time grew fainter and fainter until it was gone, like the figure. I was so scared I could barely get sleep. For the passing days, in room 109, nothing else happened.

I told my friends about this ghostly experience and they laughed about it. I know what I saw, whether it was a ghost or just my mind playing paranoid tricks on me. I still go to Teachers Camp and I still hear stories of the hauntings, even ones similar to mine, but hearing or reading ghosts stories can never amount to the thrill of experiencing one.

Grandma's Supernatural Visitors,"New York, United States",Misc,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Misc :: Grandma's Supernatural Visitors

M y Grandmother and Great-Aunt rented a house during World War II that they swore was haunted. My Great Uncle was a spy/interpreter so he had access to some things that was harder for the average GI to get... like silk stockings. Anyway, Alice & Grandma Helen noticed that things were missing (like the stockings and their grocery money) pretty often, so they locked them up in a box. Only the two of them had keys. No dice... they'd open the box and it would have been cleaned out. Then they started hearing heavy footsteps in the night going up and down the stairs and through the hallway, cold breezes where there was no explanation for them, etc. They did a bit of research and learned that there had been a murder/suicide in the house and promptly moved out. Suddenly they realized why the house had been such a good deal and why no one stayed there very long.

Grandma Helen passed away in January of this year at 101 years old. My Mom went to visit her in the hospital when she was in her final days and happened to hit a time when she was very lucid (she lived by herself until 3 months before she died and she was never senile or otherwise batty, except for the last week or so before she passed away in which she was in-and-out of it). Anyway, in a very lucid moment she told my Mom how the father of my cousin-by-marriage, whom she'd only met once or twice, had come to visit her and told her that it was ok to move on to the ""other side."" In Grandma Helen's trademark logical way she went on to say to my Mom: ""Well, at first I couldn't figure out why the 'Other Side' didn't send your father or even Bob (my Dad), but then I realized that I probably would have thought I hallucinated that. Uncle Jack though? I barely knew him. Random."" It seemed to ease her mind though, which was nice.

I kinda like the idea of an emissary being sent to usher you off to your next plane of existence. I think Grandma Helen did too. She was pretty psyched to get outta here by the end and see what was next anyhow.

Old Man of Mischief,"New Jersey, United States",Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: Old Man of Mischief

I just moved into a new house in New Brunswick for the school year that is unbelievably old. Always when I would be in the house on my own (fully knowing no one else was in the house) I would hear distinct footsteps from the floor above, traveling from one end of the house to another (very different from the usual house settling noises). The sounds of doors opening and closing would radiate through out the place, and there would always be that off feeling that someone else was indeed in the place from time to time. The event however that convinced me this place was semi-haunted was one night in the middle of a completely normal dream, it was suddenly interrupted by an older man with grey hair and a terribly malevolent look on his face. He then gave a snarl and I heard nothing but loud cackling laughter. It rocked from my sleep and the second I woke up my entire DVD rack (with about 100+ movies) slowly tipped forward and fell throwing all my DVD's everywhere.

Surprisingly I wasn't that scared. More pissed than anything because earlier in the week I had just put them all in alphabetical order.

White Lady in the Mirror,"Kentucky, United States",Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: White Lady in the Mirror

Y ears ago I used to work at the Seelbach hotel downtown. And the top floor is only used when the rest of the hotel is booked, so it goes a long time between uses. It's mostly ballrooms/meeting rooms, and maybe ten regular rooms total up there. I had been sent up to do some ""freshening"" before a big party booking, and was working alone. Typically roomkeepers work in pairs. I was straightening beds, spraying air freshener, and dusting, that sort of thing. I was sort of on my guard already because I'd been caught watching TV in the rooms and gotten in trouble for that. So my nerves WERE a little on edge already.

Anyway- I kept feeling like someone was watching me. Kept thinking it was my supervisor trying to catch me with the TV on again. (I didn't have it on.) This one room, at the corner, is laid out differently than the rest. In that room, the mirror is opposite the door to the hallway, not next to it as is normal in all the others. I was making the bed and I got that feeling of being watched, again. So I look over my shoulder- Nobody there. I turn around to pull on the bedspread (straighten a wrinkle) and there, in the mirror in front of me, I can see a woman standing in the doorway. All I could see was her head, over my shoulder. White woman, light coloured hair, bland expression- no malice or anything. But the room got freezing cold and I had the awfullest feeling. I turn around, and look over my shoulder into the doorway- and she wasn't there. But turn back- she was still in the mirror-doorway. I could not get out of there fast enough, all the skin on my whole body was crawling. It was so weird, because I'd always thought I'd be fascinated if I ever saw something like that, saw a ghost, whatever- but at the time, the physical experience was like that of taking sick, sudden, and dreadful. Couldn't get warm, and had the whole Flight or Fight thing going on.

Apparently apparitions on the tenth floor are not unusual, but they're not harmful either. I didn't go back up there that day, they had to get someone else to finish my rooms, I was too shaken up.

Fading Footprints on Deck,Canada,Misc,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Misc :: Fading Footprints on Deck

B oating is a very popular past time in the town where I grew up. Many people have cabins on islands ""out the bay"", one of which is called Swan Island. Swan Island was once inhabited by Beothuk Indians, all of which were killed by diseases or murdered by white people. There is a confirmed Indian Burial ground on one side of the island.

When I was seven years old, my family and I were staying withe my Uncle and his family in his Cabin cruiser, which was tied to the dock in Swan Island harbour. About 3 or 4 o'clock in the morning, we all awoke to the sound of footsteps walking across the deck, inches above our heads. The footsteps walked from the bow of the boat, over the flybridge, down the ladder, and across the lower deck to the stern. Thinking it was a late-night caller, my uncle put on his boots, went up through the wheelhouse and out to the lower deck where the footsteps were last heard.

The fog was so thick outside that it took a couple of seconds for him to get his bearings. He first noticed that there was no one on the lower deck. Then he noticed that we were nowhere near the dock in Swan Island Harbour, but were drifting out to sea. He had no idea where we were, in which direction we were going, or why we were drifitng away. He moored the boat in deep water and kept watch until the next morning, when he dicovered that we had drifted for miles, towards the burial ground side of the island. The bowline that had previously secured us to the dock was slashed with what must have been a very dull knife. No other boats were nearby.

We all went above deck only to find, disappearing in the morning dew, fading footprints --- bare feet --- in an almost straight line from bow to stern.

Haunted Contractors,"New Jersey, United States",Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: Haunted Contractors

M y first summer after highschool, I worked for my neighbor. He had a contracting business that mainly did light remodels on houses. Painting, general carpentry, basic landscaping, building decks, stuff like that. The usual crew was this guy, his partner, myself and one or two of my friends, and a general laborer or two, depending on the size of the job.

About halfway through the summer we got a job to do some cleanup on a house a few towns over which had been neglected for a while. Repaint inside and out, fix some squeaky floors and water damage, clean up the yard, etc. It was a decent sized house, and needed a ton of work, and the estimate was that it would take about a month to do it right. The homeowners had no problem, as they were not living there, and were planning on selling the place. Everything inside had already been cleared out (for the most part).

The first few days we spent just clearing brush and stuff out of the yards, so we could get equipment in to work on the exterior. Once that was done, we split off into two crews, one scraping the outside of the house, and one doing work on the inside. It was the summer, and the place did not have A/C, so the easier job was the work outside, and we would rotate who was in and who was out.

To give you an idea of the layout of the house. When you walked in the front door, you had large room off to your immediate right and left. Straight ahead of you and to your left you had a staircase that went up to the second floor, to the right a small bathroom, and then straight back to the kitchen and another large room. Upstairs you had 4 bedrooms and 2 bathrooms. There was only one staircase to the second floor.

We started in the front rooms, and within an hour or so our radio started acting up. It was an older boom box type thing, with a manual cassette player, and the knob with the slide for tuning the stations. In other words, it was all mechanical, not digital. At least 3 times, the station changed on its own, from 102.7 which we were listening to, to other random stations (sorry, no creepy oldies music or anything). What is interesting is when it changed stations, the station it would end up on would be perfectly tuned in, and the jump between stations was very quick, much quicker than a person could turn the knob and tune in the station so well, and then get away from the radio without being noticed, like, a seconds time, just enough time for the slide to traverse the distance to the other station. No, the radio didn't have the mechanical station presets.

At least twice when this happened I was in the room, and while my back was turned to it, the radio was in a location where it would have been damned near impossible for someone to get to it, turn the station and then get out of there. It was not by a window either. On a few occasions the volume would go WAY up, up beyond a point that I thought this thing was capable of producing. We then moved the radio to a different room, blaming it on bad power, and the problems let up.

Other strange things: Lights would go on or off while you were working, including our own portable floodlights. It wasn't the power was cut or anything, but the actual switch was thrown. You could also hear footsteps above you when you were sure nobody was upstairs.

The final kicker, as we were wrapping up the work on the place, I was replacing some molding in a second floor bedroom. I had a large heavy steel toolbox, with a bunch of tools in it, that must have weighed 30 or 40 pounds. One of those big craftsman jobs. I had finished off most of what I was doing, and had most of my stuff put away when our lunch showed up. It was raining outside, so were all sitting in the main entrance way by the stairs, in fact, myself and another guy were sitting on the stairs. EVERYONE was accounted for. By this point we were all always joking around how we were working in a haunted house, due to all the strange stuff that was going on, but no one was taking it real seriously. Everyone was pretty much convinced that it was the combination of an old house, our imagination, and probably a few of us screwing around with each other causing the stuff. Mid conversation about this, there was a giant crash from upstairs. One of the dudes freaked and just ran for the door. Myself and the dude sitting on the stairs next turned and went up the stairs. At the top of the stairs you had a clear view of the entrance way to all of the rooms, so in the 3 seconds it took for us to climb them, nobody would be able to get out of a room without being spotted.

Inside the room I had been working, my heavy metal toolbox had been tossed across the room, its contents scattered. The time from when it happened to when I got there was so short that stuff was still rolling around. Again, this was a 30-40 pound toolbox, which was sitting on the floor, and had been clearly tossed a good 10 feet. We checked the other rooms and of course found nothing. To go out the window (which was closed as it was raining) would have been a 15 feet drop into some nasty bushes. No ladders were up on the house, or even off the truck for that matter that day, due to the rain. Everyone working there was sitting with us while we ate, and nobody could have gotten past us and down the stairs while we checked the rooms, as there were people watching the stairs.

It was pretty damn scary, and the final couple of days of us working there everyone was really on edge. Nobody would go into rooms alone, and you could tell everyone was pretty much scared shitless.

The boss mentioned the goings on to the homeowner who was just kind of like ""ehh whatever"". A few years later, the place burned to the ground, and one of the guys I worked with that summer, who now lived in the town, sent me a story from the local paper. It turns out that the previous owner who lived there was a shut-in type person after his wife died a decade or so prior, didn't ever really come out much/do much, which explained the neglect. He had died about a year prior to us working on the house, but nobody found his body for at least 6 months. The people who had hired us was his estranged sons family, who had inherited the house and were trying to sell it.

The house had changed hands a couple of times in the several years after we had worked on it, nobody ever staying very long, and it was growing a ""haunted"" legend in the town.

In the interest of brevity, I left out some of the smaller parts of the story that were strange, or could have been explained away easier, but suffice to say, some weird stuff was going on while we were there. I'm not one that really believes in ghosts or anything, but I have no way of explaining some of the stuff that happened there in any rational way. Thinking about it still gives me the chills. Nobody was aware of the story behind the house when we were working there, and you could tell after the toolbox incident everyone was truly on edge.

W hen I lived in Penygroes, Carmarthenshire, my sister and I were told the house was haunted. When I was in the kitchen, I could feel sometimes a presence behind me, close enough to be looking over my shoulder. I was sure it was a lady. My sister said she felt the same presence. She woke up one morning and saw a women with dark hair and blue eyes at the end of her bed smiling at her. After my sister and I moved out, I was visiting my mom, she had a late night shift so I was in the house alone watching TV, and I felt the presence a few minutes later. I heard a laugh, I looked in the kitchen and I saw the same woman.

The Night Time Ghost,"Pennsylvania, United States",Old Hags / Night Attacks / Sleep Paralysis,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Old Hags / Night Attacks / Sleep Paralysis :: The Night Time Ghost

O ne night, when I was in the bathroom to brush my teeth, I was nowhere near the sink and it turned on by itself and turned off again. I got my toothbrush, looked in the mirror and saw nothing. I looked again and saw a white glare in the mirror that was behind me. I turned around and nothing was there. The light kept flickering on and off by itself. No one was in there with me. I opened the door and ran out. My sister said nothing happened to her in the bathroom.

At night, when I had to go to bed, I kept tossing and turning, I was restless and kept thinking about the bathroom incident. I put the blanket over my head, but my feet were out and I felt as if someone was in the room with me.

I felt someone was grabbing my toes squeezing them gently. I was too scared to look, I couldn't move, it felt like I was paralyzed. I could feel someone on the bed with me.

I was so scared, it felt like someone was on top of me. I tried to scream but it was holding my throat. I was still under my blanket and it was still on me. I kept trying to scream but I could not. I also heard footsteps in my room. It finally stopped.

I got out of my covers and my throat was in pain. I finally fell asleep and in the morning I was better. I told my sister, who didn't believe me. I could tell my mom secretly believed me. It happens to me every night. I'm so tired, I can never fall asleep. I keep asking my mom if we can move. I hate waking up every night.

Coffee-holic Grandmother's Ghost,"Kentucky, United States",Family / Friends Visits,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Family / Friends Visits :: Coffee-holic Grandmother's Ghost

M y grandmother had to wear special shoes because of surgery on her leg that made one leg a couple of inches shorter than the other. This resulted in a shuffle-thump noise that was very distinctive when she walked anywhere in our house (my mother and I lived with her) as we had hardwood floors throughout.

One night I was in from college, at least a year after she passed away, and was sleeping on the couch in the living room. It adjoins the kitchen in our very small house, and I heard a shuffle-thump make it's way down the hall into the kitchen where it stopped, and the coffee maker turned on. My grandma was a coffee-holic. I can only assume there's no caffeine on the other side.

The Scariest Thing that Would Ever Happen to You,"Michigan, United States",Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: The Scariest Thing that Would Ever Happen to You

W e had just woken up on a saturday morning. We were sitting in our beds, Maggi on the right, and Brittany on another mattress right next to Maggi on the left. Maggi's back was facing the closet door and Brittany was facing it. Brittany had to go to the bathroom really bad, but when she was about to open the door she heard scratches on the other side, and said ""Maggi knock it off"". Brittany opened the door and she felt heavy and weasy, as she walked into Maggi's room, Maggi was still sleeping and then Brittany woke her up and screamed ""You will NOT believe what had just happened to me"". Brittany explained Maggi the story and all of a sudden they were joking about it, saying that it was just your imagination and that she shouldn't get freaked out by a little scratch that could have been anything.

Then all of a sudden, Maggi popped up and started breathing heavily looking at the stairs and looking at me repetitively, then it got silent and I heard the footsteps coming up the main stairs. It had gotten louder and louder each step it took. After about 2 minutes the walking had stopped. We started talking about weird things that we have experienced in the past, all of a sudden her closet door knob turned rapidly, then stopped. While Maggi's back was facing the door, I saw the door open, I screamed and I could barely hear Maggi talking to me because of my big gasps for breath. After I screamed, Maggi jumped on me and we booked it down stairs, where we both had a glass of cold water, and found us writing this right here. That's the scariest thing that would EVER happen to you, remember don't mess around with these things because you will never know what will happen to you.

H ello, my name is Josh. One time, when I was seven years of age, I woke early in the morning from a deep sleep. I had layed in bed for about five minutes or so and had a feeling or thought of a presence appearing in my room. But then about a minute later, I had seen a figure form fade into my sight and all of a sudden I had froze in place.

As I stared at the man he appeared to be from the early days, while staring I could not move or think. The figure was really clear to see in my sight, it gave me an idea that it could be a guardian angel and I know that I was not dreaming. The figure did not move an inch from where it stood, until I forced myself to think and wished the man to go away. I had another thought about the ghost that it would fade away. The figure had just vanished with no intentions of anything, just to be seen.

I'm not sure if this kind of ghost is common to anyone but one friend of mine has had the same encounter with the unknown. It kind of makes me wonder if there is a sense of importance to my life.

The Feeling,"Indiana, United States",Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: The Feeling

M ine is a story that I can hardly tell, its a true twist of fate. To start from the beginning would take some time. It's so strange but yet all true. This is not a lie or a made up tale. All facts can be proven. I grew up in North Terre Haute. As a young man I would go to a local store that served lunches to school kids. The name of the store was Stapletons. It was located behind a gas station and across from a local tavern named Jiggs. The old man that owned the store was a scary looking fellow with a hardened face and flat top hair cut. He had a raspy voice and a no nonsense personailty. I always felt that he was harmless but there was something about him that always made my gut feeling stir. He and his wife lived near my home and was near a gas station that we would always ride our bikes to. It was one of the nicest homes in the area. I can remember stopping in front of the home to just stare in wonderment of what was in there. I never seen anyone at or around the house. Just lights at night, dimly lit.

As time when by and I became a teen in highschool. Thanksgiving morning 1978 or 79 I believe, I watched Mr Stapleton die. My Father and I were on our way to the IGA for my Mother and were among the first to arrive at a horrible auto accident. A kid that I went to school with and later I worked with him for a few years, had a Buick wildcat that had dual exhaust. He would drop that car into low and nail it to hear the pipes roar. I rode in that car a few times. That morning Mr Stapleton was visting his brothers business and was pulling out onto highway 41 at the same time a car was turning another direction. My friend from school past the car on the wrong side and T boned Mr Stapletons car. Witnesses said that he dropped the car into low and nailed it when he hit Mr Stapleton, killing him.

Years went by and I watched the house go down hill and eventually forgot about it all together. I married and shortly after the birth of my second child I bought a home near my parents and remolded it. We were all happy and content until one day I drove by the Stapleton home and seen that they were getting ready for a estate sale.

The day of the sale I went with my youngest daughter to by a rocking chair that was listed. After looking at the house I went inside to look around, I was amazed that the home was well built in the 1960s. I had a few strange feelings but dismissed them, like a sick sense came over me for a short time. I got really into the home and the possibilities that it had. With nothing more than barely 20% down, I bought the home. I was shocked and so was my wife. I had no idea how this home would change our lives.

I started the day tearing out the old and making a new home. I totally gutted most of the home and modernized the home. It was big and beautiful. Little did I know that the strange happings of the home would haunt me and stay with me to this very day. It started when I stripped the basement and walk out attached two car garage. I would work very late and sometimes stay alone in the home, wake up and work some more. I had a dealine with the bank and my love for the home drove me on. One night my Father and I were working in the basement, I had cut a hudge whole on the living room floor to place a stairwell to the new basement family room. We heard someone open the back door and walk across the floor to approximently where we were but above us. I yelled out down here, without reply. I went up a ladder and seen no one. We were puzzled and laughed it off. The next few nights were filled with strange happenings, I would encounter moving cold spots and could follow them in and out of rooms. It was probably just drafts from a big old home. The spots would chill you to the bone.

One night on a hot summer evening, I was working and my dog Sam a German Shepard was very nervous acting. She would jump up and bark and growl at something. I thought nothing of it until I heard a big bang noise coming from the master bedroom. I investigated the problem and found that the bathroom door slammed shut. Sam was barking at the door. Drafty old house!

There were logical explanations for the happings, I thought nothing of it, I am a very logical open minded person. I would later come to realize that a power unseen was at hand. I never believed but now I am very sensitive to spirits and strange happenings, I learned over time not to listen with my ears but my inner feeling, first impression sort of thing. While working on the home I would hear strange noises and unexplained silly things to me. The master bath door slammed from time to time and got stuck at one point, jammed shut. I removed the door and trimmmed the uneven portion from the bottom and rehung it. That lasted for a while. I finished the home and moved my family in and started to enjoy the home and its fireplaces and open space. It was then that we all experienced strange things.

I awoke to my wife yelling at me about the new cabinets kitchen cabinets I installed. It seems that someone opened all of the doors during the night. Over the next few months this happened several times, I took the blame as a prank not wanting to scare my wife and kids. I put every dime I had into this home, I could not leave. It got to be such a joke that we would hear someone come in the back door while we were downstairs and walk across the floor. Everytime the same thing: not a soul in sight. It was all so real. One night my two daughters were sleeping and I awoke to creaking noises in the hallway. I then heard someone walking down the hallway and grab my youngest daughters door knob and twist it several times. I yelled at my oldest, who is handicapped, to get back to bed. She often would night walk in total darkness. She did not have the ability to fear darkness. I got up to investigate. My oldest was sleeping soundly and my youngest had a small dog that was at this time barking. I looked in on her and she told me to stop making the dog bark. I stood in the hall freezing and thinking this is real. This next morning she told me that turning her door knob and making the dog bark was not funny. I laughed and played off as my fault.

Soon after that Sam stayed in the garage just under our bedroom. She would bark so aggressively that I would have to get up and scold her. Then I discovered that everytime she barked the basement window was wide open. My wife and I both experienced this. Over and over again the dog would bark and the window would be open. I bent the latch on the window so it could not be opened. This was fine for a couple weeks and then one night Sam barked and the next morning the window was open. This really got our attention.

It was soon after that many unexplained things happened. Glasses flying out of the kitchen cabinets in the middle of the night, doors slamming and the bathroom door, I removed it and trimmed it five times, one time leaving a one inch gap to stop it from sticking. It was unbelivable, the door was level and plumb. One evening we were in the family room downstairs and heard someone enter the house via the back door and glass break, I jumped and ran upstairs to find a vase, on the fireplace mantel, was broken on the floor. The door was locked. I was mad, I yelled, We are a family and we live here now, we are good people, leave us alone.

Things were quiet for a while and nothing remarkable happened until a cold January night. We had been in the country all day playing in the snow on quadrunners and arrived back home in the early evening. I backed my truck in the drive and opened that garage to let Sam out. She greeted me and made me scrach her head and was just so happy to see me. She would not leave my side, she acted strange to me. Again that feeling happened, but I dismissed it. I left Sam at the entrance to the garage and told her to do her duty. I got into my truck and looked in the mirror and saw Sam just fold up and fall on her face. She dropped dead. I picked her up and took her inside built a fire in the family room fireplace and me, my wife and kids held Sam and cried. As I went to put the quads away, the basement window was open. Sam had clawed and chewed at something, marks on the wall from her efforts painted a picture as clear as could be. That feeling made my blood run cold. I will never forget it.

In the weeks after Sam died everything clamed down. No feelings, no unexplained noises, everything went well until one March evening. It's something that I will never get over as long as I live. My wife and I had been fighting, our marriage was coming to an end and we were trying to get back on track by going to Saturday evening Mass. We were all standing at the door in the family room getting ready to walk out. There was a laundry room between the family room and the garage. I started to open the door to the laundry room with the family right behind me and something was pushing the door from the back side. I was fighting the force back and forth until it slammed on me. I got mad and burst the door open with force.  No body or no thing was in the way. My wife and kids witnessed this. It was truely the last straw for me. At this point I was very frightned and mad. The house tore us apart. It changed me and us forever. I moved out shortly after while divorcing, my youngest daughter moved to the basement family room with her girlfriend. She stated that clocks would not keep time and the t.v. would turn on by its self. I had seen this happen too. She and her girlfriend saw a lamp fly acroos the room and hit the wall above the bed. They moved upstairs that night.

Many strange things happened while I was living there, I tried to explain them and convince myself that it was nothing. I was wrong !

The whole experience did something to me that will forever be with me. I dream of my experiences from time to time. I left something unfinished there. I just can't put my finger on what. I stop short each time I get close to it. It still haunts me to this day. Thats what made me confess this. Maybe somebody can give me insight.

The house was sold shortly after we divorced, It sold in three days. I wonder if the new occupants have any strange happenings? There is so much more to tell, I wish I could write it down. But I fear that nobody will believe me and mock us for what we feel is a ghost.

The home is located in North Terre haute Indiana, 3365 Crystal Ave. I want to go back and talk to the new residents, but I fear that I may open a chapter that I cant finish since I no longer live there. I can say I truly saw figures at times of someone or something or maybe just shadows from the corner of my eye. Never the less the feeling I got was the presence of a ghost.

Two Eyes,"West Virginia, United States",Non Human Entities,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Non Human Entities :: Two Eyes

M y name is Melaine. I am a 13 years old who has had but one experience with the paranormal so far throughout my life. Here it is: I was 6 years old, and it was a normal November night for me. I was in bed by 8:00 sharp, as every night, but I usually stayed up an hour later... I was looking out my window as I had done at that time to get to sleep. I had always been ""scared"" of the dark, and I would be sure to cover my whole body up and only leave a small slit open, so I could breathe. But on this night I had been feeling brave and decided to take the covers off my head.

Well, as I was looking out my window I had felt a creepy feeling come over me and instinctively threw the covers over my head. After the feeling passed I took the covers back off and my eyes went straight to the window. There, in that window, were two huge, blood red eyes staring at me. I couldn't move, it was as if I was frozen with fear... and then, they were gone. I regained enough of myself to throw the covers on my head and stay up half the night scared to death.

Then about 4 years later I was in my kitchen, thinking about what had happened, my babysitter was watching me and I asked her if she had had any unusual experiences and she broke down crying saying that she didn't want the man in the window to come back! I asked her which window and it was the same window where I saw those eyes!

Bristol Bay,"Louisiana, United States",Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: Bristol Bay

I 'm not really sure about where to begin this story, there is really no climax, just some strange experiences. My best friend and I had just moved to our new two bedrooms apartment that we were sharing. I guess we were there for a couple of weeks when strange things started to happen. The first thing I remember is my computer always turning itself off. It was not just a shutdown because everything would be off... the speakers, the printer, everything. I wrote this off, and thought maybe it was electrical problems, but then nothing else in the house would change (ie, the clocks were not reset). Since the day we moved in, we both noticed a strange feeling in the place, kind of like a heavy restless feeling, but I did my best not to connect these two ideas in any way, and decided it was just a new place, new town.

A couple weeks after that, things started to get more strange. My bedroom door would slam for no apparent reason. We tried turning the fans off, closing windows, turning off the central air... anything we thought might be contributing to this, but nothing helped. What made this even more strange is that we had very thick, plush carpet that met the bottom of the door, which would make it difficult for even a strong draft to slam the door. This continued, but we would only hear it, never see it. That changed one night when I was in my bedroom, getting ready to take a bath. I had just ran the bath water, and went back into the room (the room and bathroom were connected) to grab my robe. For some reason as I was digging through the pile of clean clothes looking for my robe, I felt compelled to look at the bathroom door. Just as I did, it slammed shut right in front of my face. I decided against my bath that night, and opted to sleep in my friend's room with her. She was more calm about the situation, but it was beginning to take a toll on me, and it seemed it all happened in my room. That night, we were sitting on her bed, talking about all of this, and from where I was sitting, my bedroom door was in plain view. We were talking, and it was odd, but it was like I knew my bedroom door was going to slam. I kept watch from the corner of my eye, but nothing happend. I decided to shake the feeling off, and focus more on the conversation. As SOON as I looked back at my friend, the door slammed louder than it ever had. I was through... I freaked out and was stern in my conviction not to go back in there any time soon.

I stayed in her room for a few days, and that is when it started in the kitchen. We were sitting in her room watching TV one night and I heard water running. I heard it but I payed no attention. We lived in a complex with over 250 units and with someone living above, below and on three sides, you tend to hear everything. After a while though, I realized that the sound was close, like it was coming from our apartment. I went into the hallway, and I could see into the kitchen... the faucet  on the kitchen sink was on full blast. We racked our minds for the next twenty minutes to make sure neither of us had left it on... neither of us had used the sink.

A few nights later, we were getting ready to leave the house and as we were walking to the front door, I noticed my friend looking strangely towards the kitchen. Reluctantly, I turned to see what it was, and what I saw was the cabinet, where we keep the cups in, was open, and totally empty. Not one cup in there. We just looked at each other crazy and left. Later that night, we came home and I walked into my room to get something. As soon as I opened the door, staring my in my face was the kitchen cups. All over my bedroom floor. As can be assumed, my reaction was not a calm one, and at this point, my friend was scared as well. Until now, she kept calm and insisted that we ignore it, etc. Not any more.

We ended up moving out a few weeks later because of a job transfer we both received, but I cant say that I wasn't happy to go.

Something in our Villa,United Kingdom,Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: Something in our Villa

I recently went on holiday for a week with my boyfriend and my parents to fuerteventura (one of the canary islands). We rented a private villa and when we arrived I immediately did not like the room myself and my boyfriend were staying in. I got a very peculiar feeling that I had never experienced before; it was not a bad or frightening feeling, just an odd uncomfortable sensation. When we arrived we sat down in the kitchen for a cup of coffe. I remember sitting at the table and just glaring constantly into our room almost daring someone or something to walk past the door. It was odd because at the time I didnt know why I felt so uncomfortable there, as I had never previously experienced anything supernatural whatsoever. I just knew something was not ""right"".

Throughout the holiday I awoke continuously throughout the night; sometimes 4 or 5 times, with the feeling that someone else was in the room. I never had a decent nights sleep. One night I awoke right at the edge of the bed with the same familar feeling of a ""third person"" in the room. The little bedside table next to our bed was gently thudding against the wall. I watched it for a few seconds wondering what could be causing it, and I even shuffled right away from the side of the bed just incase there was any slight chance I was doing it myself. However, as I half expected, the table carried on thudding against the wall. It was not violent, just a gentle thud, and I did not get a frightening feeling at the time. To be honest I was that tired I thought nothing of it and fell back to sleep.

The next morning when I woke up my feelings of something ""not right"" in our room was confirmed, but for some reason I did not tell my boyfriend or my parents anything about it. After all, who has heard of a haunted modern spanish villa...? On the second night I woke up a lot more than usual because my back had got burnt that day and I was sore, so I kept a bottle of after sun cream on the bedside table so I could keep reapplying it throughout the night. One of the time that I woke up, I put some aftersun on my hand and leaned forward in the bed to rub it into my back. I just so happened to glance in the big long mirror we had on the wall along side the bed, and I saw something very peculiar. Even though it was dark in the room, I saw very clearly a tall thin man, and he was coming towards the mirror. He was quite a long distance away as if he was reflected from the bathroom coming into the bedroom. He was wearing black, but he had a long white frilly thing running down his middle; as if he was wearing a white frilly shirt and a black jacket. A bit like a dinner suit. His hair was strange, it was cut just above shoulder length but was curled up all around the bottom in a kind of bob, and it was ginger. This all happened in a matter of seconds. I turned around to look around the room but it was dark and appeared empty. I woke up my boyfriend to ask for the time and he said it was 6.30am. I asked him what time it would start getting lighter and he said he didn't know, so I turned on the light and eventually drifted back to sleep.

Later that morning I felt I had to mention all of this to my boyfriend and my parents, and I told them everything that had happened. That night was the last night, and I kept the light on but I couldn't get to sleep. I wasn't scared to be in there, but I didn't particularly want to see ""him"" again and I was scared to open and close my eyes. It sounds daft but as it was my last night there I was a bit worried he might do something to wind me up. So in the end we took all the bed clothes into the living room and slept on the sofas. Nothing happened that night and although I was on my guard a lot and woke up several times, I felt relieved to be out the bedroom.

We've been home for a few weeks now and the other day my boyfriend admitted that he had also had an experience. He said that one night when we were asleep he suddenly had a mini 4 seconds dream of a shadow of a man in our bathroom crossing the room to close the shower door, and then he woke up. He said he didn't want to tell me when we were on holiday in case it made things ""worse"" (by that I think he meant making my complaints of a man with ginger hair in our bedroom worse)!

I have emailed the company we rented the villa from to ask if any other guests had reported anything unusual in the villa, but I have had no reply.

Violent Ghost Attack in Dream,Australia,Old Hags / Night Attacks / Sleep Paralysis,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Old Hags / Night Attacks / Sleep Paralysis :: Violent Ghost Attack in Dream

T his whole experience seemed 100% real as it was happening in my mind, I assume it must have been a dream but it was, by far and away, the most realistic dream/nightmare I have encountered.

I, what I thought was, awoke from a deep sleep, with trouble breathing, as though something had its hands wrapped around my neck, I opened my eyes to see this person, who was under my covers, sitting knees first down on top of my chest choking my throat, with their knees holding my arms down.  I couldn't see a face straight away.  I tried screaming for help from my wife who was working on the computer in the adjoining room, but was unable to mutter much more than a faint murmur, due to the being's hands wrapped around my throat.

After several minutes of trying to fight this being off my body, I finally got a hand free to knock on the wall to attract my wife to come for help, where I was able to somewhat fight this being off my body until my wife came in and I was then able to see this beings face for the first time, looked like a blond female's face who had been drowned.  My wife finally helped me get this being off me and as I got up to hug her and turned around the being was gone.

I got my wife to come to bed with me and we held each other close, and finally slowly dozing off again, I realized that this being was back and that it was not my wife.  I felt a surge of pressure being applied to my body by this being, as it once again tried to sit down on top of my chest, while I was fighting this being, I assume I passed out.

What seemed to be about 5 minutes later, I physically woke up, for real, this time, threw my covers off, turned on the light and headed straight for my wife in the next room.  I told her about my experience and she could see I was quite shaken up about it, I asked her about things like did she hear me scream?  Did she come in to help me?  To which she didn't.

All I could put this down to was a dream, but after reading similar stories on the net, wonder if it could be more of a sleep paralysis syndrome?  I take antihistamines before sleep, but have done so for well over 10 years now, with no previous occurrence of this at all.  I have had what I believe contact with the paranormal before, although previous times have been when I was well and truly awake.  I have had about a month ago what I believe to be a real ghost ""good"" dream with my deceased grandfather.

Can ghosts visit in dreams?  I didn't think it was possible?  This experience has freaked me completely, and hope there have been others that have experienced something similar in the past?

Ghost in the Woods?,United Kingdom,Apparitions / Voices / Touches,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Apparitions / Voices / Touches :: Ghost in the Woods?

T his all happened during this past summer (august), here in Cardiff, UK. At about 7pm, my friend and I decided to go into the woods at heath park, as we were very bored that day, and I believe it was one of the hottest days on record for the UK, so we were very hot and bothered.

We trekked into the woods until we came to a huge tree, we sat by the tree for nearly an hour cooling down,  it was also next to a large pond. At about 9pm we realised that it was very nearly dark, so we decided to make our way back home. We had about a 15 minutes walk to get back out of the woods and nothing strange had happened until I noticed a figure, about 200 yards away from us, back from where we had just come from. I thought this was strange, but thought nothing more of it. About 4 or 5 minutes later, I looked back and saw the figure again but this time it was closer, I thought this was strange as there were no people close to us when we were at the tree so I decided to tell my friend. Josh thought I was messing around with him and did not believe me at all, this was much to my frustration.

About 3-4 minutes later, again I looked to the side and the figure was about 50 yards away only it was in amongst all nettles and bushes, I was really scared at this point as we weren't even half way through the journey and it was very nearly dark. I told Josh to keep looking around and to speed up our walking pace. A few minutes later Josh saw the figure on the other side of us and we were both really really scared, so we ran. When we got into the open field which would lead us to a road, we ran about half way into it and looked back and we both saw the figure standing on the edge of the woods. We ran all the way home.

The figure that we saw was very weird because every time I saw it, it was perfectly still. We could not make out the face, or gender of this thing, it was just in what looked like a blue cloak. I have been back to the spot a few times since  the day and nothing strange has happened, but me or Josh will not go back there at dusk again.

Little Boy Blue,Philippines,Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: Little Boy Blue

H ave you ever had an encounter with a spirit, an entity or something paranormal, but you were not aware of it until someone told you so? This is such an experience that I had in the office when I was working late. So before I start the story let me get into the details first. My name is Matt, I work in a call center here in Manila Philippines. So since we have to adjust our schedule to the country we are catering, most of us in the call center world usually work the graveyard shift. So on with my story...

I had this experience with a little boy in the elevator. He was about 3 feet tall and was always wearing blue. We would always share the elevator during my break at 3:00 am and he would always go down on the 4th floor, my office was located on the 6th floor by the way, and I would always bid him goodbye and he would just walk away without saying a word. There were times when I tried talking to him but he would just put his head down and wouldn't talk. So I was scared that I might offend him with my talking, so every time I see him I just kept quiet.

So after a few encounters with the kid, I started thinking of certain things. 1. who's parents does this kid belong to and 2. what is he doing in the building during those hours. So after a few days of not seeing the kid anymore, and with some luck, I finally had the chance to catch the guards down stairs in the lobby to ask them about the kid. (because usually during the grave yard shift, they would do their routine rounds on the building).

What happened next made the hair on the back of my neck rise! I told the guards that I have been seeing a young boy on the elevator and asked who he was and what he might be doing in the building during those late hours. One of the guards smiled and said, ""little boy blue, 4th Floor right?"". And I told him that he was right, and asked what was on the 4th floor. ""Nothing!"" he exclaimed. It turned out that the 4th floor had been vacant for 3 years now. They also told me that sometimes when they are making their rounds, that they would spot the boy on the 4th floor running through corners of the hallway and when they turn to look where the boy went, they would find that no one is there. I can feel my face turning pale and my heart pounding with fear.

After that I never had an encounter with the kid anymore, but sometimes the elevator still stops on the 4th floor and you could hear a giggle of a little boy in the cold and wide hallways of the Harrison building.

White Entity,Philippines,Non Human Entities,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Non Human Entities :: White Entity

T his is one story that still haunts me until this day. I am the type of person who does not believe in ghosts but have learned to respect their reasons for being on our plane. I belong to a group of friends who were really into the paranormal things that are happening around us. Being in this type of crowd I could not help myself in believing a swell (with the way they tell their stories), and being dragged into opening my sixth sense. Call it peer pressure but I guess thats just the way it is.

For a few days, nothing out of the extra ordinary was happening. So I told myself, ""hey maybe it didn't work"". Given the fact that I did not believe in those type of beings, I thought perhaps the ceremony had no effect on me. Then it happened, one night I woke up in the middle of the night and wanted a glass of water. I was so thirsty that it could not wait until morning. So I went down for a cold drink. After filling my glass with water from the container, I closed the fridge's door. Standing beside me was a white figure with bloody red eyes. I was so scared that I dropped the glass on my hand and closed my eyes and prayed. When I open my eyes there was no one there, so I figured it was just my imagination.

So to help me sleep, I had this great idea of watching T.V. to help me doze off. So I got the remote and pointed to the direction of the television. Now before I could even turn the T.V. on I saw on the black screen that the white figure was standing behind me with a big grin on her face this time together with her bloody eyes. This was the last draw, I ran up to my mom's room and slept beside her until morning came.

The next day I asked the group to take their so called gift from me because I could not take it anymore and that I never wanted to see the white figure again.

Jeepney Ride,Philippines,Misc,"I t's funny when certain events in our lives occur and we blame it all to bad luck. What's funnier is the things that we do to counter the flow of bad energy that causes these so called bad luck or bad events. At least at that time I thought it was funny, until my friend shared her unlikely experience.

This story is about my friend and her scary jeepney ride going home. For those of you who don't know what jeepneys are, they are a popular means of public transportation in the Philippines. They were originally made from US military jeeps left over from World War II and are well known for their flamboyant decoration and crowded seating.

My friend went home late after finishing their school project, now since she lives within the vicinity of the U.P. Diliman campus (University of the Philippines) it was perfectly safe for her to take the jeepney instead of taking a taxi in going home during late hours. It was about midnight when she took the ride home, and she could not help but notice the driver kept glancing at her through his rear view mirror and then he would turn to her. (Now all jeepneys have their own route and do not take any turns and they have to stick to their route or else there is a big chance that they would run into some cop trouble). What's odd about this jeepney ride besides the eerie glances that the driver gave from time to time, he was also taking turns in corners that he was not suppose to. Afraid of what the drivers plans are, she was even more afraid of her surroundings because it seemed as if she was in the middle of nowhere already. So instead of going down, she just stayed on the jeep. On the last turn that the driver made, she noticed that they were back on the route that they were suppose to be in the first place.

Before reaching the end of the terminal, the driver turned to my friend and said, ""Im sorry if I scared you or startled you! It was not my intention"".. ""Could you do me a favor and BURN all your clothes when you get home"".. Wondering why my friend asked why he was acting very strange. The driver explained, ""The reason why I kept glancing was because your head was not attached to your body when I looked through my rear view mirror."" ""That is why I changed my route awhile ago, hoping we could get away from the bad energy present in that area, and thats why I want you to BURN your clothes when you get home because I think its still with you.""

Upon arriving home, still shaking from fear, my friend took all her clothes off and burned them as quickly as she could. A few days later she found out on the news that the jeepney driver died a day after the incident. It turned out the warning was not for her but for the driver.

Encounters of Marie,"New York, United States",Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: Encounters of Marie

I have just moved into my new house and I've overheard my mom talking about a ghost in our house named Marie. I didn't believe her, but one night, I was having trouble sleeping, so I went to the bathroom. It was a warm, spring night, so there was no cold feeling in the air. I walk back into my room, and it was very cold in a part of my room, near the closet. I just ignored it. A while later, I saw her, standing next to the closet. I got scared and ran into my mom's room. During another day, me and my friends were having an iced tea sale in front of my house. My sister ran into the house for some more mix and I was trying to scare her by spraying the window with the hose. I have realized that she walked back outside. So I dropped the hose and looked back at the window. All of the sudden, I see an old lady shaking her finger at me. Marie died in my house in her sleep at an old age. The same night, I hear a whisper in my ear: ""Get out."" We also found out that she died in my room!

The Crippled,Philippines,Misc,"E ver wondered how things came to the way they are? Why some places give us this eerie feeling when we pass through it. Why we meet people who give us this uncomfortable feeling even if they are not doing anything. Ever picked up money on the street or on a side walk? Lucky huh! But did you ever wonder who it belonged to and why it was lying there in the first place? History was never my thing, for me everything and anything bad from the past should be left there and should be forgotten through time. But what if you had a thing or an object that links you to an event that has happened in the past. Would you let it go, or would you be thankful that you have it.

This story took place on my grandmother's house, where I had my summer vacation. I love spending time there because there is a lot that a person can do inside and outside of her house. She has a big pool, a big flat screen T.V., tennis and basket ball court,  and all the amenities you could think of that is, or should be found in your modern home. That is why the 1980's looking cabinet she had on the living room seemed a bit off or out of place. So I asked my grandmother where she got the cabinet and if it was new. She made a joke about it and told me, ""it's from the 80's dear, I doubt that is new"". With a smile on her face, she told me that she just passed by an antique shop two weeks ago when the cabinet caught her eyes. She thought it was pretty so she bought it.

I was having the time of my life and everything was great. I had 2 weeks vacation time and I was only on my third day. Everything was okay except for the loud thuds that kept me awake at night. I did not pay much attention to it though, because when I asked what that was, it turned out that some men were working on some renovations to the house next door. They were on a tight schedule so some of the men work even at night. And even though the sound seemed different, I just took their word for it. I didn't want to ruin my time with thinking there were ghosts in the house.

One evening I was watching a late night movie when I heard the loud thuds again. This time it seemed as if they were coming inside the house. I was worried thinking it might be someone trying to break in, so I followed the sound to have a look. The sound seemed to be coming from the living room. The weird thing was as I got closer to the sound I could hear some screeching and scratching sounds after the thuds. What I saw next was the most horrifying thing I have ever seen. No amount of scary movies or Hollywood effects could have prepared me for what I saw that night. It was an old lady soaked with blood. I thought the loud thuds were footsteps, but it turned out those were her hands banging on the floor. The scratching sounds were from her long nails as she scratched dragged herself across the room. She was crippled and couldn't walk, it also seemed as if some of her bones were out of place because some of her body parts were deformed. She was crying out for help, had no eyes and only had a blue eerie light that seemed to be coming from the back of her head, that lit her eye sockets.

I ran to the maids quarters given the fact that it was closer than where my grandmother's room was located. I woke everyone up and told them what I saw. When we came back the floor was spotless clean and nothing was there. Next day I convinced my grandmother of returning the old cabinet to the store. Upon returning the cabinet, my grandmother asked who was the previous owner. It turned out that an old woman used to own the cabinet. One day, she just disappeared. Some say she went back to the states without anyone knowing, some say she was brutally murdered, some say she was beaten to death and was stashed somewhere. ""But no one actually knows what became of her"", ""No evidence was located, and no body was found as well."" said the vendor. Neither my grandmother nor I said a word. We were speechless and couldn't figure out what to do. We just left the cabinet there and went home.

The weird thing about the story of the old lady, was that no one even bothered to investigate on her case to know the truth. Her family just tried to make some money out of her belongings and that was it. But the weirdest part of all is the people who hear this story sometimes claim that they see the old woman every now and then, asking for help, crying out, curled up inside their own cabinets.... FREAKY!

Picture Frame,Philippines,Misc,"I always believed in ghost. And I wished to see one to experience the thrill that everybody is experiencing once they encounter things like that. I don't believe that I'm the type of person who have the ability to feel and see spirits, like a medium. I don't have a third eye to recognize them. Not until the following encounter:

My first encounter with spirits happened when me and my ex-boyfriend were hanging out together in our house. We were talking about it because he has the third eye. He can see ghost and feel spirits around. We are on the midst of the story when suddenly the picture frame on the wall fall down to the ground. That was funny because nobody pulled it off and it can't be pulled easily without human force. The fan is off and the air outside the house is not enough to do that. I looked in my boyfriend with questions in my eyes. He just bowed his head and told me to stay inside. He went out of the house and then I heard him talking to somebody else. But I didn't see anyone except him. He then went back and told me everything was all right. He already spoke to the person who did it. It was a spirit from their house who followed him. It's apparently a white lady who get jealous of me. He told me that everywhere he goes that spirits are following him and he almost forgot about it when he visited me. He asked me the time my mom and my little brother were coming home. I told him I didn't know, maybe a minute from now. He didn't leave me from that moment until my mom arrived.

An hour later, my mom came home and we bid each other goodbye. After he arrived home I started to feel dizzy and felt coldness wrapping my whole body. My mom advised me to go to bed and she covered me with blanket. One blanket was not enough so she added one more. Still, I felt so cold even though I was wrapped up with two blankets. I then texted my boyfriend and, worried about my condition, he then called up and told me to wear anything that has a cross or God's image on it. Amazed, I grabbed the rosary from the altar and wore it. After 30 minutes I started to feel the heat coming from the wrapped blanket and sweat started to drip off my face. I called up my boyfriend and told him I was starting to feel good already. He then told the shocking truth that I've been touched by the lady when they got off from the house.

After that encounter, I did not wish for my boyfriend to open my third eye. I'm afraid to see more of those and feel that odd feeling again. I'm now contented to watch scary movies and hear ghost stories everywhere. I realized that having the power to see them is not always good after all.

White Lady,Canada,Apparitions / Voices / Touches,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Apparitions / Voices / Touches :: White Lady

O ne day when I was 10, my friend and I decided to go out for a walk in a near by forest. In the forest, there is a old abandoned rodeo, we were playing there when we saw a young lady, probably in her early 30's, staring at us. She was in a long white dress but the thing that scared us was that she was transparent. We decided after that that we were going to hide in the forest since we weren't due back home for another hour. While we were hiding, we saw her again and she called out to us in a hoars voice. She told us to run, run fast. So we did as we were told. And then, as we reached the edge of the forest and we looked back and she was looking around scared, then she looked at us and screamed and twisted her face. Then she started to glitch and she vanished. I never went back there ever again.

Unknown Girl,Canada,Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: Unknown Girl

M y name is Krystal and the story I am about to tell you is authentic. Last summer I was lying down on my bed trying to sleep. In the past, I have had trouble sleeping and was moving around a lot. I share a room with my little sister and I sleep on the top bunk. While I was trying to sleep, I happened to turn and face the wall. It felt like someone was looking at me. I heard something at the foot of my bed so I looked over the edge, at the floor, and saw nothing, so I lied back down. I still felt someone looking at me and thought that it was my little sister, so I looked to my other side and saw a little girl about 4 feet tall, with short brown/blond hair. Still thinking it was my sister, I told her to go to bed and turned around. Just then the ""thing"" touched my shoulder and I swung to move the hand. As I swung, the hand released and I yelled at my sister to leave me alone. Then I looked back and the little girl was looking at me again. But this time she was frowning. I was tired so I thought that my sister was joking around. I yelled for my sister to go to bed, then layed back down. Then I heard a bang on the bed. When I turned around the girl was gone. I yelled for my sister to get up, but she opened the bedroom door from the kitchen and asked what I want... It turns out that my sister was in the living room with my mom the whole time. To creep me out even more, I realized the next day that the girl in my room had brown hair, while my sister has bleached blond hair.

I would really like you comments on this and tell me what you think. This was so scary I would never wish anyone to see that little ""thing"" again.

Last thursday I was taking a nap (which I never do) as my friend was taking a shower. Then out of the corner of my eye I thought I saw a little girl. She was sitting on my shelf. I turned on my light to see and no one was there, so I decided to ignore it.

Two days ago, I was cleaning my room with my clock radio on, then static came on and people were talking. It wasn't the radio because I had my other radio on too and they were singing a song... so I turned my other radio off, listened and it was a little girl and a older woman. I was scared. Then my lava lamp top flew off my cupboard and fell to the ground. I screamed, then I got this horrible feeling and I had to leave my room. When I came back, the lava lamp lid was put back and the room was steamy hot. I was scared.

Another time when I was baby sitting my sister,  I was vacuuming and all of a sudden someone screamed downstairs. But my sister was in the living room. Very scary.

Comment my story... I am very scared of this 'girl' and I don't know how to get rid of her... I think she is bad... I don't know for sure, though.

Le 419,Canada,Haunted Places,"B ack in the 1980's my lover and I moved from parkdale in Toronto to 419 sherboune. It was an apartment on the 3rd floor, the door to our apartment was on the 2nd floor. We moved in with 3 cats and a dog. It was a large one bedroom with the bedroom at the top of the stairs across from the kitchen, it had a long hall way with the bathroom 3/4 of the way down the hall and the living room at the end. The building was old and the living room had a kitchen sink in a small room type area behind a wooden book shelf. I was told that they use to rent each room out, a rooming house kind of thing.

The first time I thought that something strange was when we came back from London and found a wooden cross that was on the wall on the floor and one of our cats in the bathroom on the windows seemed frightened, our two siamese were under our bed. It was strange as they always came out to greet us, especially after we were away over night.

The door to our apt was on the second floor, there was about a 6 inches between the door when it was closed and the first step. The steps had a carpet but the cats discovered the carpet under the first step could be pushed back and they could get into the walls. I put a small window screen between the step and the door to keep the cats out of the walls. My lover worked in a beauty supply shop and closed the store at 6:00pm every night. On several occasion I would hear what sounded like our apartment door being opened and someone coming up the stairs, but only to the third step, the dog would hear it too, and would go to look with me but no one was there.

One evening I heard the door open and someone come up 3 steps then stop, when I went to look there was no one there but the screen from the bottom step was laying on the 3rd step. I mentioned this to my lover who just laughed it off and said it was my imagination. One evening a friend of his came to visit at around 4:30pm and we had a coffee and talked waiting for my lover to come home. My dog was in the living room laying facing the hall. Our friend and I heard the door open and someone come up 3 steps. I looked at the clock and it was just 6:00pm so I knew it wasn't my lover. I looked at my dog who was looking down the hall and had just started to wag her tail when she suddenly jump to her feet and started to bark and growl, every hair on her back was standing up. Our friend grabbed my big ashtray for a weapon as we thought someone had just broken into the apartment. We rushed to look down the hallway but my dog kept blocking me and would not let me enter the hall, all the time she had her eyes fixed and appeared to be looking at something about 6 feet from the floor, all the while growling and barking. My friend and I could not see anything.

We searched the apartment and found the cats on the bed with their tail all fluffed up and eyes as big as saucers. After searching the apartment with me, our friend left, asking me to have my lover phone him as soon as he came home. I took my dog and sat outside till my lover came home and asked him to call our friend right away. Our friend told him what happened and we wrote a notice to our landlord saying we were moving out.

As soon as we got the keys to our new apartment I took our cats over, usually when cats are taken to a strange place they hide, but this time our cats ran around and played. I went back once after moving our stuff out to check the mail, I took the dog with me but when I reach the steps to the building she refused to go up.

My Grandfather,United Arab Emirates,Family / Friends Visits,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Family / Friends Visits :: My Grandfather

I just turned 19 when we heard that back home in India my grandfather had passed away. His death was unexpected, he was healthy even at 71 and did a lot of household chores by himself. My grandma had nothing to complain about. I was shattered, I loved him very much and he was my mentor and idol. Dad was already with grandpa, when he passed away and with the news, my mom, brother and I packed our bags and caught the first available flight out. When we reached home, it felt like another place in another life time. It was cold and drab, nothing like the house I had spent so many holidays in. We proceeded with the funeral, after which a lot of people came home.

I was with my aunt, mom and grieving grandma, when suddenly I had this overwhelming urge to turn around. When I did, there in the corner of the room stood my grandpa wearing his favorite clothes. I don't remember what I felt at that time. I know that I froze, but when he smiled, I began to relax. ""I'm alright sweetheart"" are the last words I heard from grandpa as he stood there and continued smiling. Tears welled up in the eyes, out of relief or being overwhelmed, I don't know but as I turned to wipe my tears and looked back again, grandpa was gone!

I can still hear his words when I think of that day, his words of life - after his death!

Haunting at 8 First-Street,South Africa,Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: Haunting at 8 First-Street

T his list of encounters which befell my family (mother, father, older sister and myself) dates back to the years 1990 up until early in 1995. At this time it may be relevant to mention that in this town, all houses are leased for free to the town's inhabitants, before our relocation into this house, early in 1990, it had been standing empty since 1983.

It was less than a week later that my 3 year older sister started speaking of a woman she had seen in the living room the night before. The woman as she had described had blonde hair and no face. Her being young of age, the rest of the family had let the incident slip by without taking much ennessial notice. Relevant was her persistance to this story and her fear of a built in back yard BBQ that she wanted 'removed'. What made my mother and myself take notice that perhaps it had not been my sister's imagination after all, was an event that had occurred just over a month later: at this time my mother, my sister and myself had all been in different locations of the house when the front door had opened and we all heard my father step inside and say ""hello"" as he always did. What made this greeting slightly different than usual was that when we all went to greet him, he was nowhere in sight. What added to the mystery was a telephone call an hour later stating that my father's car had broken down at work and my mother needed to come collect him. This incident had been enough reason for my mother to give in and have the BBQ wrecked.. nothing out of the ordinary was found.

My personal second encounter happened one evening while my sister and I had been lying on her bed. Her having just drifted off to sleep my gaze had fallen onto the floor where I had caught glimpse of a what looked like a sheepdog run across the floor, sure it was somewhat smaller, but genuine nonetheless. The animal had scurried across the floor and had gone into hiding beneath the bed, that was the last I had ever seen of it. That was the night before the crows started to appear..

In the months that followed these events seemed to die down and very few (including my father) would believe my mother, my sister and my own claims that there was something wrong at 8 First-Street. At this time, however, my parents started growing concerned about my growing fascination with the undead and macabre, which made sense since I wasn't even yet 5 years old at the time.

The next event that occurred, I believe it was close to Christmas time, involved a beating of drums in the back yard. My sister and myself had been getting up to the normal childhood mischief when a steady beating of drums had starting ramming on the outside gas bottles. The drumming had been soft and slow at first, then louder.. faster.. until it had been loud enough for any witness to hear. This had been enough to drive both my sister and myself to tears and we had fled the house and sat crying in the street until our parents had returned (from shopping or wherever it was they had gone). This inccident had laid to rest any doubt that my mother may still have attained, although my father had remained unconvinced.

What events had occured in the years 1991 and 1992 had in the years past slipped from my memory, with only 3 personal experiences remaining: the 1st had been while the rest of my family had been in the back yard and I had been alone inside. Until this day I can still recall an unknown presence that had laid its hand down on my shoulder, an icy sensation that now over eleven years later I can still remember as clearly as if it was happening right now. It was also round this time that my parents had discovered the art work I had done with my top room cupboard: three walls. two doors all covered in drawings of the dead. It was also in this cupboard that my favorite childhood book had vanished in an instant. This meaning that I had been sitting in the dark, reading it with a flashlight and the next moment it was gone. A thorough search by both my parents proved useless and what happened to it remains a mystery up until today.

The third incident I recall happened in middle 1992 while my sister was away at camp, this detail I recall particularly well for it just made it all the more strange that on the relevant morning wherever I had gone in the house her voice had still been calling out to me.

Early 1993 and all others are awoken from the silence by the father greeting incident repeating itself. Also my fathers' skepticism takes a knock at this point as my mother told the story of the night before where our newly aquired Labrador Retrievers both looked to the roof and started barking at an unseen force, the loud sigh that had followed not even my dad could deny. It wasn't much later that my mother started speaking of hearing a voice singing in the hallways late at night, a voice that would die down every time she went to check on it.

My sister had at this time also started growing more and more disturbed at what was happening around us and at one point claimed that an icy presence had been chasing her around the house and had been lifting her up whenever she had tried to stop. Although this did sound far fetched to even me, the way she had looked right after she had made this claim, suggested differently. What made matters worst was another incident which had supposably occurred while my mother had been collecting me from a friend. On our home coming we had discovered my sister and a friend sobbing in the street, spewing claims that footsteps had been heard in the hallway, doors had been opening by themselves and light and radios had been switching on and off by themselves. At this time it was now a mutual agreement, there was something seriously wrong. My own sighting of a teenage boy in the hallway (which I later lay eyes on again, that time with a witness) just added wood to the fire.

A summons not much later, that my sister had called together involving her, myself and two of her male friends would be the last time that these forces would ever be felt and after that it was as if nothing had ever happened (even the crows stopped coming), except one last thing:

Two years had passed since the final sighting at 8 First-Street and I (age 9) found myself sitting in the classroom. At this point a young girl who lived only a couple of houses from me (and coincidently had the same name as my sister) with whom I nonetheless had never truly spoken with started telling the class about a ghost of some kind in her house, the stories were exactly the same as mine. It was that same week that the crows again returned, very few at first, later up to 20 at a time.

TV Gone Crazy,United Arab Emirates,Poltergeists / Physical Manifestations,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Poltergeists / Physical Manifestations :: TV Gone Crazy

A bout a month ago, my husband, daughter and I decided to spend a week at my mother's as it's closer to our workplace. We had an ongoing project and were putting in late hours, so it was easier to crash at mom's place after a tiring day. On one such night, we came home at 11:00pm, sat talking for a bit and had our dinner. My daughter and husband slept quickly.

My favorite show was on and I decided that I'd sleep after watching it, when suddenly, the pop up menu for the color and contrast adjustments opened and the color adjustment button went from 1-100 and vice versa, repeatedly. My tv just went static. I just stared at the tv, not knowing what was going on . I figured, since the cables of the tv in the hall and my parent's room were connected, they must be making adjustments. Nevertheless, I got up and headed for their room just to be sure. They were asleep. In fact, sound asleep, and the tv was not on. I headed hurriedly back to the hall but the pop up had disappeared. Disturbed, I settled to watch the show again, when the pop up came on again. Ahh I thought, maybe I was sitting on the remote, lifted my behind, but no remote. I remembered that I had placed it over the tv, so that my daughter could not reach it. So what was happening on my tv screen? Ghosts? Very calmly and in a stern voice, I said , whoever you are, please leave as you are scaring me. In a second, the pop up disappeared and my show was back on. I can't explain this... can anyone?

Korean Haunting,"Korea, Republic of",Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: Korean Haunting

I came to South Korea to be with my husband whom is in the Army. I have been here for 5 months. I have been living in my apartment for over four months. About two and a half months ago I started getting the icy felling like I was being watched. This went on with no happenings until last night. My husband is training in the field. I am all alone in the house, just like any other night I got changed, went into bed and called my husband. I got to sleep around 12:30am.

I slept for about two hours when I started having a dream that I have had before. But instead of what normally happened in the dream, an unknown force was on my back with two handfulls of my hair, holding me down. I woke up to find that my head where, in my dream, this force had my hair. I blew it off thinking it was my imagination. I fell back asleep a short time later. The dream resumed where it had left off. This happened one more time before I decided to just stay awake. It was about 5:00 in the morning, I am not exactly sure. I heard a Korean man's voice talking, it was very deep, I could not make out any words that I know. It sounded as if he were hissing the words. By this time I was already terrified. I heard knocking, and my chairs being scooted around. This went on for about an hour. Then it started scratchng my walls. It started soft and short at first, I ignored it until it got harder and louder increasing a lot everytime.

Finally I could not take it any more it felt like my heart was going to burst, it was beating so hard. I got up and turned on all the lights in the house. It stopped. I got dressed and looked around to find all my chairs moved, little things moved, and then I saw the scratch marks on the wall. I was about 6:30 in the morning when I left. I am looking for another apartment. There is no way that I am going to stay there and let it keep getting worse and more violent.

A Ghost  in Heat,Philippines,Succubus / Incubus / Sexual Ghosts,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Succubus / Incubus / Sexual Ghosts :: A Ghost  in Heat

I remember once that my husband and I were arguing about the paranormal. Specifically ghosts that haunt the living. He was a wee bit scared sleeping in my ancestral home.

Let me give you a background of our home sweet home. I live in a 39 year old house inside a compound. There are 5 houses in a row each facing another group of 5 houses. It was said that the place, where our compound was housed, was haunted. This was the place where Katipunero soldiers passed to get to Balintawak. This was a forest where ambushes and battles took place. Thus  there were many people who lost their lives here. Even the maids in our house told us of their own experiences with the ghosts that haunt the house.

So my husband will was not so keen in sleeping in the house. His third eye was slightly if not reluctantly open. He used to experience and see ghosts wherever he went and in the places he lived.

We were already getting ready to go to sleep. We were lazing away in bed just watching the television. He said that since he began sleeping in the house a week ago he had never experienced any sighting. He said he was lucky - maybe. I was teasing him and said maybe the ghost in the house did not like him enough to warrant a look see. He turned off the television and snuggled deeper into the covers. The air conditioning was on. I also fixed my pillow and snuggled and positioned my self getting ready to go to bed. He then turned to me - a little pale. He said ""Honey there is something sitting at the end of the bed next to me."" I answered back that it was just his imagination getting the better of him. He said that he felt the bed sag on his side. I turned toward him and just embraced him reassuring him that it was just one of the ghost saying hello.

I was so used to having a ghost or ""dwende"" in my room. Each room in the house has its own entity residing in it. Each a unique paranormal entity. I have never really been bothered with them since they have never hurt anyone in the house hold. They are felt, heard and sometimes seen by the people living in the house.

My husband just asked me to keep my arms around him. Embracing and reassuring him that nothing would happen to him. So I guess we were already noding off to sleep since I remember that I was already somewhat dreaming. He suddenly shook me to wake me up. He said wide eyed ""Honey it's not near the end of the bed anymore. It's touching my penis."" With that we both sat up. I told him the best way is just to say a prayer. I took the holy water that I keep in the room for emergencies - like this. I sprayed the whole room more on the bed. I was hoping that the entity - who or whatever it was would be cooled by the spray of holy water.

We prayed then lay on the bed and pulled up the blanket. We slept and next thing I knew I woke up to see the rays of the sun passing through the curtains of my room. It was already morning.

Unknown Presence,"New Jersey, United States",Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: Unknown Presence

I want to start off by saying that I couldn't really think of a interesting title for this story, so I apologize for it's lameness. This story took place in my house about a year from today. I have been practicing astral projection and developing my psychic abilities for years now, and it has been the one thing I can never know enough about or read enough stories about. Ghosts have also been a very intriguing subject to me, as my mom has told me stories how she has seen a ghost, along with many other family members.

Before I start my story, I would like to give my interpretation on ghosts and whatnot. I believe that spirits of the deceased that did not wish to continue their journey into heaven or whatever you believe, stay with us on earth, as a entity invisible to the naked eye. I think that when we actually see a ghost with our eyes, it is our mind allowing us to see this alternate dimension for a short period of time, or for some people all the time. But that is why we only see a ghost when we least expect it, because maybe our ""third eye"" is more active then usual. This is something I personally believe, and do not push others to conform to.

My stories actually dates back to when I was about 10 at my old house when I saw what I thought was my dead uncle whom I've never met but only saw pictures of and heard about. He died in a car accident with my dad, but my dad survived. About 4 people said they saw him the day he died in the house walking down the stairs or knocking on the door. I saw him sitting on my couch, and I literally ran upstairs as fast as I could. I later heard him whispering my name when I was drawing late on night.

Fast forward to last year. I was laying in bed watching T.V. when I felt something or someone lay next to me or at least put some pressure on the bed to make the bed go down even more. The bedroom light was on, so I didn't really panic or anything. I just laid there wondering if what just happened was real. Later that night, I was trying to astral project and my guitar that was leaning against my wall made a noise that it can only make when someone walks past it. It's kind of like a pressure asserted on the neck on the guitar that makes the tuning knobs click. If I were to walk past it, this sound would follow almost every time. So after I heard this sound, I tried to play it off like it just happened by coincidence, but then it happened again. I was certain that some sort of presence was in my room, because when meditating and achieving a trance state, I become very much aware of things I normally wouldn't. It's tough to explain to anyone who does not practice astral projection, but it's like having another sense opening up.

So after all these events went down, I was officially convinced that I had a ghost in my house. I must also mention that a few years back, I saw a black shadow pass through the crack of one of my doors where light was shining through, and when I went to turn on the light in the room I was in, it shattered. I was scared shitless.

The day after the bed and guitar thing happened, I wanted to tell my dad, but I knew he didn't really believe in that sort of stuff. But I began to tell him anyway, and he stopped me and said, ""Were you home around 3:30pm yesterday?"" But I was at work, so I said no and asked why he had asked. He said that he had heard footsteps around our upstairs when he was downstairs grading papers. He said he called out both me and my brother's names because he was so sure that someone was home. This pretty much convinced my dad that something freaky was going on in my house.

That's the end of my story. I'll be back to post again if anything else crazy happens. Good luck all.

Go Away,"Rhode Island, United States",Misc,"I have a few stories to tell. One day I was laying in bed with my hands under my pillow when a hand just pet the top of my head.  I started screaming because I was just 9 or 10 years old.  My mom ran in and said ""honey what's wrong""  I just told her that something pet my head and she said don't worry I'm right here. She left the door open, left the room and I said go away.  The next morning I got up and the door was closed, thinking my mom closed it I went to open it and it wouldn't open, I used a little more force but it still wouldn't open so then I used 2 hands and tugged as hard as I could and it just swung open.  I went and asked my mom if she closed the door and she said no.

Here's another story: I was laying on the couch because I felt like sleeping on the couch.  I turned towards the hallway when two blobs slowly floated from my room to my mom's room.  I started to cry because this was just after the first story.  My mom came to me because she heard me and she was on the computer which was about 5 feet from me.  She came over and asked what was wrong and I looked really scared. I pointed towards the hallway and said 2 things just floated by my room into your's.  She said it was nothing and just my imagination.

This all happened at my old house and I think my mom knew it was haunted but just didn't want to scare me.  Well, tell me what you think and what they could have been.

A more recent story: This might sound weird but this happens mostly in the bathroom. Sometimes when I'm in there I hear people wisper my cousin's name (Thomas) or say hey what's up.  I get really scared and they still talk today.  Only once in a while I hear footsteps on the part of the roof I can see.  Sometimes it will happen in my room.  I have no idea what it could be. Tell me what you think and what it could be.

This just happened a few months ago. One day I was playing basketball when the ball hit the base of the hoop.  It started going down a hill and I went to get it.  I grabbed the ball and looked up.  There was a shadow standing there leaning on a tree (my house is surrounded by woods) and there was something on its head.  It was dawn so I grabbed the ball and ran.  The next day I asked my neighbor if he knew what it was, and he said that indians used to walk around the woods a long time ago.  And deep in the woods a house burned down and the 2 people that lived there died in the fire.

The Operating Room,Philippines,Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: The Operating Room

H ave you ever felt eerie when you visit a hospital? A feeling that someone is watching you?

I am a nurse and I used to work in one of the oldest and most historic hospital's in Manila. In this hospital I was assigned to one of the most exciting areas - the operating room complex.

The operating room complex is divided into two distinct blocks. The right block is where all the scheduled operations take place whereas the left block takes care of the emergency, trauma and OB-Gyne cases. The whole complex is quite haunted and each block has its own collection of ghosts seen and felt by numerous nurses, residents and surgeons.

It was one ordinary working day. I was assigned to the night shift. Going on duty from 10:00pm to 6:00am the following day. My friend and I were discussing the presence of a ghost on our wing since she saw one the night before. I was telling her that I had heard a voice of a little girl when I was assigned to the other block. She laughed and said that the ghosts in this block were more aggressive and really made their presence felt since most of the patients that have died in this particular block have suffered traumatic accidents like being stabbed or shot. Most not really prepared to die.

I entered the operating room where I was assigned. I relieved the nurse from the previous shift. As soon as I was assisting the surgeon for the cholesystectomy case that they were performing one of them asked me what my friend and I were talking about. I said ""We were just talking about the ghost she saw last night in room 11"". They asked me if I believed in such things and I answered that I did believe in ghost since I have felt their presence in the OR complex. Almost all the room are haunted. They then told me about their own eerie experiences in the same complex.

The operation was taking longer than I expected. We took a break while waiting for the x-ray technician and his machine to arrive. We asked the circulating nurse to providee us with some seats. We took our seats and after sometime I was beginning to nod off. I suddenly felt a cold hand or finger touch my cheek. I opened my eyes to see if my co-nurses were playing a trick on me. I saw that the rest of the team was asleep and the other nurses were busy since there were other procedures being done in the other rooms. I decided that it was just my imagination getting the better of my so I closed my eyes again.

I was falling asleep again. The presence was not satisfied with just touching my cheek. It became bolder... more intense. It nudged the chair where I was sitting. After this I just stood up fully awake now goosebumps all over my arms and legs. I looked for my co-nurses leaving the sleeping surgeons to fend for themselves.

Poltergeist,United Kingdom,Poltergeists / Physical Manifestations,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Poltergeists / Physical Manifestations :: Poltergeist

I lived in a second floor flat with both of my parents. When we first moved in, a neighbor told us we should not move in there, that the flat was used for constant partys using the ouija board. My dad did not take any notice of the neighbor at the time. I was about twelve years old.

Three nights after we moved in, it started. We had a plastic runner in the hallway to protect the carpet. We all had just gone to bed when we heard something running up and down the hallway on the runner. My dad jumped up and turned on the light. It stopped. My dad thought some one broke in, he checked the flat, there was nothing, just us. He turned the light back off. I went to sleep in my mum and dad's room. Ten minutes later, something was running madly up and down the hallway again. My dad jumped up and ran in the hallway. The running noise stopped. My dad was now standing in the bedroom doorway, he swore and shouted to go away, which made it angry because we heard the kitchen cuboards opening and slamming shut and our thick mahogany chairs sliding across the kitchen floors. My mum started screaming in a state of shock. My dad turned on the lights, the cuboards stopped banging and chairs stopped moving when my dad went to the kitchen. All the cuboards were open and chairs were in the middle of the kitchen.

We had years of this. My dad was the first one to see the spirits and I was the second to see them. There was two. My mum only heard them and never saw them, which was a good thing because if she did, she would have had heart failure. The one that haunted me the most wore a black robe with a hood and no face. He had big hands like shovels and wore a big ruby ring. He was 7 feet high and his shoulders were wider than the doorway. He looked like the grim reaper. The other spirit wore a white robe and was the same size as the other one and had a white ruffle round his neck. We heard voices arguing, one was telling the other one ""you have had your fun its time for you to go now"". My mum was a bag of nerves, she went to the vicar. They sent people to see if we were mad or if it was real. One day after, they gave the go ahead for the exorcism.

I'm now 30 and live in my own house. The other week, my son came screaming down the stairs, saying he saw a man in his room. When he described it, I knew who it was. My son is ten and scared to go upstairs on his own now. I swear it's punishing me, it made my life hell for years, but I got used to it. I thought the exorcism got rid of it but now my son has seen it and I know he hasn't heard me talk about it because I don't. It's my secret.

Recreation Center Ghost,"Florida, United States",Apparitions / Voices / Touches,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Apparitions / Voices / Touches :: Recreation Center Ghost

I was in the recreation center in dunedin florida and I had to go to the bathroom. When I got there I heard a crying sound. When I asked who was crying no one answered. I then went and told the counselor that someone was in there. They came and asked who it was and again, no one answered. Then they checked all the stalls, there was no one in there either. They told me I was just imagining it, but I knew it was true. Later, when I went back I heard them crying again. I looked in the stalls, no one was there, but the crying was still there! Creepy huh?

Dark Shadows,"Florida, United States",Apparitions / Voices / Touches,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Apparitions / Voices / Touches :: Dark Shadows

T his is my first time writing something like this, so don't make fun of me or anything, but here it is: About two years ago I lived at my grandmother's house for a while, and I've always been kinda freaked out by it, because it was over a 100 years old and really big and creepy. Well, one day I was taking a shower, and I casually glanced at the door. As I did, a dark, black silhouette of a young girl hovering about a foot over the ground emerged through the door. Then it faded away as it reached the clear shower curtain. I was FREAKED! So I rinsed my hair and was gone! I told my mom and my family and they kind of laughed at my story, but understood because of how scared I was.

The next night, I was sitting in my dinning room still thinking about what has happened. I was looking at the reflection of myself through the sliding glass door, when a dark figure of a man walked in front of me. I couldn't actually see it, but I could see it through the reflection. Naturally, I got up to run. Not thinking, I ran the direction it was coming. I guess I passed through it or something, because for a split second, I felt a deep, chilling sensation pass through my body. Almost as if I felt the spirit's pain. I told my mom again about what had happened, and she said they were trying to contact me for some reason. Do you think she is right, or if it was something else? Please tell me what you think because this hasn't been off my mind since it happened.

The Man in the Back,American Samoa,Apparitions / Voices / Touches,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Apparitions / Voices / Touches :: The Man in the Back

N ow, this is not an event that had taken place in front of my own eyes, but it has surely happened to my grandfather. My dad told me this story and it gave me a chance to look at spirits who have yet to rest but are not actually ""scaring"" people to death. Here is my grandfathers tale:

My grandfather was only 36 years of age and he of course needed a job. He had looked in agriculture, the stores down the street, even the starkist factory that was quite a ways away. No jobs whatsoever. Finally, after 3 weeks of looking, he had seen an ad for a ""wanted bus driver for the night shift."" At the time he didn't care what kind of job it was or when he had to work, all he cared about was supporting his family.

After a few days, he had gotten the job to work from sundown to an hour before sunset. The bus driving job was steady, he really didn't have any riders unless it was someone who also worked late. Soon, he had picked up on which riders came on, what time they came on and where they should be dropped off.

But, a year into the job, he had gotten a new rider who would only ride for that one night. He saw the man standing at a stop to which no one had stood before and for the first time he could stop there. The man was described as: well-rounded, pale, with a blue suit (which was very odd because it is so hot in samoa, even at night). Like every other customer, my grandfather had welcomed him with a smile. Being the kindly fellow my grandfather also tried to talk to him. He asked him: ""How are you this evening?"" ""Where did you come from?"" and just normal conversation questions. The only thing this man replied to is where he should be dropped off.

My grandfather tried to get something cheerful out of the pale man, but there was no response. As soon as the bus got to the destination as stated by the man, my grandfather opened the door, looked up to the mirror and said to him ""Here is your stop sir"" and looked ahead. Usually, at this time you can hear the passenger get their stuff together and proceed to the front. But not this time. He heard dead silence. He looked up at the mirror again, AND SAW NOTHING.

The Cold Touch,"Colorado, United States",Apparitions / Voices / Touches,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Apparitions / Voices / Touches :: The Cold Touch

I t was not more than a year ago where I had experienced the most dreadful feeling when I was touched by a ghost, at least I feel like it was a ghost. Here is my story:

It was late February and the snow was just melting away. My little sister was spending the night with her friend, and my little brother was doing the same at my cousin's house. I was living the life of an only child to which I never want to do ever again. I had just finished watching a re-run of ""family matters"" in our downstairs family room and I was getting a little bit tired. So I turned off the t.v. and walked up to my room in the dark. When I turned on my light it was as if I was replenished again so I started watching my own t.v. As I did so, I had closed my door and locked it, that way I could change into my pajamas.

I laid in my bed, watched a couple of movies and finally I had felt tired like before. I checked my room again. I made sure the window and the door was locked and that my closet was closed so that the cat wouldn't get into it again. I turned the t.v. off. I couldn't fall asleep for some reason so I started to count sheep. All of a sudden, I hear someone walking on the stairs. At first I thought it was my mom or dad (who happen to be in their room across the hall fast asleep). I looked at the crack of my door, there was no light on! I heard the steps go up the stairs, then down the stairs, then up again. It continued... it went down the stairs, then started slowly coming back up, I coughed, and I heard it run up the stairs extra fast!

I then heard my doorknob moving as if someone was trying to get in. Now let me tell you, if it was my mom or dad, they would have already been yelling at me for locking the door. But I didn't hear any yelling, just constant breathing and huffing to get through the door. It suddenly stopped. A few seconds later, I heard the door unlock! I then thought to myself, ""there is no key to my room, as a matter of fact, there is no key hole to the knob!""

SWOOSH! The door then flies open and hits the back wall. I then retrieve under my blankets and then pinched myself because for a moment I thought I was in a terrible dream...I WASN'T. I then heard the person walk slowly into my room and stand right beside my bed.

Then, it touched me! Both cold hands were on my back... freezing cold hands. As soon I as I felt that, I screamed out ""MOOOOOMMMMM, DAAAAADDDD!!! Papa, papa, papa, please help me, papa, papa!!"" After that, I heard everything go backwards. It walked out, closed the door, locked it, rattled the knob, walked up and down the stairs and then was gone.

Seriously, no one believes me! My mom and dad said that they didn't hear a thing and no one else was there with me. But I know what I heard and what I experienced. To me, it was all true.

The Little Girl,Guam,Apparitions / Voices / Touches,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Apparitions / Voices / Touches :: The Little Girl

W hen I was about nine years old, my mother told me a story of what she saw in the jungle. It was my cousin Alicia's 5th birthday party. My mom's car was blocking another person's car from getting out. So she went to move so that the other person could get out. She tried to start her car, but for some odd reason it would not start. She tried to jump start the car on her own because she was on a small slop. After trying a couple times she went to call one of her nephews to help her push the car.

When she returned to the car with her nephew, she told him to watch out for any kids behind the car before rolling it down. When she finally got the car to start, she looked in her rear view mirror to see if the coast was clear and there was a little girl standing behind the car. She then hit her brakes and honked her horn. Her nephew ran to her to see what she was honking about. She told him that there was a little girl behind the car. He looked around and saw no one. After letting the couple out, she parked in the same area. She got down out of the car and, in the jungle, shines a semi glossy light on the same little girl she saw behind her car. By the time she called my cousin to see what she saw, the girl was gone and out of sight. She went back to the house trying to find that little girl she saw. No one came close to matching the description. When I ask my mom about it she always says she was probably imaging it.

Scary Sleep Pressure,United Kingdom,Old Hags / Night Attacks / Sleep Paralysis,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Old Hags / Night Attacks / Sleep Paralysis :: Scary Sleep Pressure

I have read many stories about ghosts, sleep paralysis, etc. and can see quite a lot of logic. I feel I have to post this story in order to get my own answers based on other peoples experiences as it's not easy to just ask the right person.

For the last couple of years I have been experiencing a strange feeling whilst I have been sleeping. It has probably happened about 15 times all in all and I am 22 years old. Now, when I am asleep, I might be dreaming of whatever and then all of a sudden I feel some sort of presence around me. Now this feeling is really nice and it makes me feel really relaxed. I also feel like I'm in the state of waking up. Then all of a sudden, I feel immense pressure on my two shoulder blades pushing me into the bed (I always sleep on my stomach). Now, normally you can wake yourself up from dreams, but from this, I can't. I am fully aware that something horrible is going on. I feel my heartbeat race and start to panic, nothing I can do seems to stop it and as I can't see whats going on its even worse. I can however clinch my fist but its a real struggle. Then all of a sudden it stops and I wake up feeling really scared. Now I'm not the type to get scared easy or anything, but it's just how I feel. Another time, just before the warm safe feeling, I felt what can only be described as dog feet walking across my bed and duvet. Then it turned into another episode with the same results. This only happened once.

I have since moved out with my partner and it has happened again which leads me to believe it might be sleep paralysis. However I have never felt so much terror before in my life as when this happens. I feel like I am being tricked to feel safe and then set upon by something really nasty. What I am really hoping to achieve is that someone might be able to relate to this and help in finding out more about it.

An interesting point to add is that my Dad has also suffered from this. When I told him briefly about it, he explained it to me in detail and it was scary how similar the symptons were. So if anyone can shed some light I would be really greatful. Thanks for all your time!

The Abandoned Ghost Village Ruins,"Indiana, United States",Misc,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Misc :: The Abandoned Ghost Village Ruins

F irst, allow me to say, that I do not endorse this story, nor do I have any evidence to support it. I merely think that it's interesting - to ponder, wonder, come up with possibilities to its existence, etc. I don't necessarily take it to heart, nor do I expect you to. Serious opinions, interpretations, etc, are welcomed. I just ask that comments be respectful.

This story has been passed to me, and now, in a sense, to you. It was handed to me by my elder brother and sister, who both, when questioned separately, stated the same details, to my recollection. I have not done a recent questioning to verify this, but I assume. In any case, I find it interesting, I hope you will as well.

As children, my older brother and sister would sometimes make use of the forest nearby their home (this, for those who are curious, was before I was born: my brother and sister are quite older than I), playing there from time to time, I believe. I am unsure if they did, for certain, ""play"" there, but they did, at the very least, have to enter on one occasion. Unfortunately, they did not know the terrain well.

Our father, who is not the brightest, nor is he very responsible, had taken on the task of caring for a friend's feline pet (a domestic cat, of course). The cat, while under his care, managed to escape. Fearing his friend's response to the fact that the animal had gone missing, he sent out a search party (at least I assume this was his logic)- AKA, my brother and sister. Their destination: the woods.

My brother and sister set out to find the cat, more than likely against their will, but determined nonetheless. They wandered farther and farther into the woods. Searching and searching, they come up empty handed. Not a cat to be found. It was beginning to get dark: they did not have much time.

Continuing the search, they wandered between a pair of trees... and into the broken, ghostly remains of what they refer to as a ""village""... there wasn't much... the frames of old buildings... perhaps lost long ago in a fire. But the empty remains were the least of their worries.

As it was getting even darker, they began to head back... but wait... the direction in which they came, simply led them right back into the remains of the village. Around and around they went, but ended right back in the village. Until it hit them- the two trees. They began looking for the same two trees through which they entered. At last, they found them. They walked, once again, between the two trees... and, as if magic, passed back to their path home. They could only enter the village, and likewise, leave, by walking between these specific trees.

As it became darker, they finally arrived home, safe. And as it turns out, the cat had been hiding at home all along! But their quest to find the cat led them into a strange place that I'm sure they will never forget. Perhaps it was a portal to a piece of the past? No one knows, and I doubt that anyone ever will.

White Mist,United Kingdom,Orbs / Lights / Mists,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Orbs / Lights / Mists :: White Mist

I live in an almost 300 years old farm. My house was built by monks. I have always felt weird stuff in my house, like the occasional cold spot and noises, but I always just thought it was in my head. A few years back when I shared a room downstairs with my sister (the room I am currently writing this story in) I saw something. It was a boiling hot night and I was desperate for a drink. I sat up and grabbed my drink, when I took my first sip, I saw something at the bottom of my room and I was petrified. It wasn't any particular shape just like a really clear white mist with a strange movement in the middle going outwards. It is so hard to explain. I slowly put my drink back and slipped under the covers and didn't look back up. My family didn't believe me, so I invited a friend around to sleep, not telling her about what I had seen. That night she woke me up crying, saying she couldn't sleep on her own, so we moved into the living room. The next morning she told me that she had seen something very similar to what I had seen, but this time, it moved out into the hallway and it was gliding very slowly. I don't know what it is and I hope that you believe me because I wouldn't lie about this sort of thing, if you have any ideas it would be very highly appreciated.

A Grandfather's Experience,"Texas, United States",Family / Friends Visits,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Family / Friends Visits :: A Grandfather's Experience

A ctually, this story wasn't exactly my experience, but I thought I'd post it up and share it with people.  This is my grandfather's experience and he told me all about it.  When he was younger, he and my grandmother lived in Nava, Coahuila, Mexico, and he always loved to be around his father or my great-grandfather.

Then one day my great-grandfather died and my grandfather was heartbroken.  It was extremely hard for him to have his hero and someone special to him dead, but one day, about six or seven years later, my grandpa was getting ready for bed, taking his pills when he layed down and was about to close his eyes, when he thought he saw something on the window that his bed was right next to.  My grandpa opened his eyes alertly and was suprised to find his father's (or my great-grandpa's) face in the window looking at him and smiling as if he were still alive and healthy.  Then my great-grandpa opened and closed him mouth as if trying to tell my grandpa something.  That's when his face dissapeared and my grandpa saw it one more time another night, in the exact same spot, before never seeing it again. Sometimes my grandpa tells me that when they go to Mexico, he always sleeps in the same spot, and that he would look out the open window (to see if he could see his beloved father's face again) and just stare out and the happy memories of his father would come flooding back to him.

I was touched when my grandpa told me this story.  One night when me and my family were staying in that house, I had to take the bed next to the window where my grandpa had seen great-grandpa's face, and I don't think I slept the whole night because I just kept staring out that window hoping to see something.  Although I didn't see anything, I got this comforting feeling (and also a tat bit creepy) that someone was watching over me and that someone was next to me, making sure I was safe.  Maybe it was my great-grandpa, maybe it was just me or something else.  Well, I hope that I could get some opinions from people who will actually take time to read this.

The Haunted Blue House,"Texas, United States",Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: The Haunted Blue House

I decided to share another story since it came up to my head.  I lived in this blue haunted house from when I was new born baby to when I was about two or three years old, so I wouldn't remember much but my mom told me about it.

My mom was much younger in those days and so was my dad. My sisters weren't born yet and my brother wasn't either.  My mom, dad and I lived in a small, old blue house and there my mom would always experience paranormal things.  Like once she told me it was early in the morning, my dad had gone to work and I was still asleep, then she heard someone washing dishes in the kitchen! When she got up to check who was in the kitchen, nobody was in there and the dishes were in the sink, dirty and unwashed.  Another time my mom was in bed and my aunt came over to the house and knocked, but my mom couldn't get up because someone was pushing the covers tightly around her and my mom thought it was my aunt, so my aunt came in and asked her why she didn't open the door, and my mom told her why.  My mom also told me that when I was two I had my own little ghostly friend and that I would talk to someone unseen normally like if I was talking to someone alive.

Also, she would tell me that someone or something would stand at the foot of her bed and pull the covers off her (my dad was at work and I was asleep, so it couldn't be someone my mom knew who lived here).  I also remember my mom telling me about the ghosts living in the closet during the day because she would hear the closet door open EVERY SINGLE night at around 10:00pm to start the night's mischievousness.  I know a lot of you are looking at this story and probably laughing at me or something but it's true, and I hope that I get comments expressing people's opinions. So please think about it and then tell me your opinions.

Haunted Home,"Ohio, United States",Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: Haunted Home

I have many paranormal experiences I could tell, but the one that stands out the most for me happened a long time ago when I was still a child. I grew up next to a home that had a violent past. The first owners were killed by an escaped convict and their youngest son was beheaded and his head was never found. Supposedly it was tossed into a gravel pit that was nearby at the time. The next couple to purchase the home split up and the wife along with her months old baby jumped from the upstairs window and fell to their deaths. Well, you get the picture.

Due to a snow storm that had fallen on our town, my mother and father not being able to get home to me and my brother, we had the misfortune of having to stay with our neighbors for the night. Needless to say my brother and I were scared to begin with because we all knew of the happenings in this house. At first nothing seem out of the ordinary, but as the night worn on strange things began to happen. The first thing to take place was while we were all sitting in the living room watching TV, we could hear someone in the kitchen doing the dishes. There was no one else in the house and there were no dishes in the sink to be done. So we all went back into the living room, then we heard glass breaking in the bathroom. This caused everyone to jump and run to see what had broken and how. There was no broken glass anywhere and everything seemed okay. Things settled down for a while, I thought if that is the worst that was going to happen then I am going to be okay. Boy was I wrong. I was laying on my neighbor's couch, just about to fall asleep, when a rocking chair began rocking all by itself and and I heard the faint sound of a baby crying. As if this wasn't scary enough, I soon heard footsteps coming down the stairs and a little boys voice calling ""Mommy"". Scared as I was, I went to the stairs to see if someone was just playing with me. I knew it wasn't my brother because he was already asleep. There was no one there. I ran and put my head under the covers and didn't come out until morning.

I spoke with my neighbors and asked them how they could stay in a house like that, and they said that they were just use to it and they didn't pay that much attention to it any more.

Haunted Cottage,United Kingdom,Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: Haunted Cottage

I grew up in a 200 years old cottage in South Gloucestershire, South West England. My parents spent 4 years (1981-1985) renovating the cottage to a livable state as it had been empty for a few years, the last resident had been an old lady.

The original house had only two upstairs rooms, both were bedrooms in which you had to pass through one to get to the other. My dad added a bathroom and another bedroom to the rear of the house. He also added a landing so each room could be accessed separately.

Strange things started to happen once we moved in. My parents had one of the bedrooms at the front of the house, the other was the spare room for guests and I had the new bedroom to the rear of the house.

In the mid 1980's my grandparent's had come down from Yorkshire with my aunt who was living in America at the time. My grandparents stayed in the spare bedroom and my aunt stayed with me on the bottom of my bunk bed.

After everyone had gone to bed, my aunt awoke to the sound of my bedroom door opening. My door was the typical old cottage style with a latch, where you have to press down on the outside of the door and a lever on the inner side goes up allowing you to then push the door open.

The door opened and then slowly closed. My aunt called out 'hello is anyone there?' Without reply, she put it down to a draft and went back to sleep. A while later she awoke to the bed violently shaking, naturally she thought it was me playing games and she asked me to stop. Realizing that I was fast asleep she then called out 'whoever you are just stop it'. This then stopped the bed from shaking. I am not sure if she slept after this but I know it was many years before she would talk about it.

Several years later in the 1990's she came to visit us again. I had since got one of the bigger bedrooms at the front of the house and my aunt reluctantly had to use my old bedroom which had since become the spare room. She awoke in the middle of the night to find a lady in a bonnet at the bottom of her bed staring at her. I have never heard what else happened.

Touched by a Ghost,"Ohio, United States",Family / Friends Visits,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Family / Friends Visits :: Touched by a Ghost

F irst I would like to say thank you to the unbelievers out there for helping to keep the discussions lively. My story begins back in the early 80's my father had become severely ill and was going into the hospital. I didn't want him to go but I knew that he needed to be there. I asked him if we could go fishing when he got home and he said ""If I come home"", I think he knew he wasn't coming back. He went into a coma a few days later and remained in one for months.

Well one night during the summer I awoke having to use the bathroom and needing a drink of water as it was a very hot night and we didn't have air conditioning at the time. I returned to my bed and was just about to put my head down on my pillow when I noticed a white light above my brothers bed and it began to get bigger, I looked around to see what could be causing the light and there was nothing. I kept watching the light grow until it took on the shape of a woman in a long flowing white gown and long flowing white hair, but no face. Now believe me I was ready to scream and run from my room, but before I could the spirit laid her hand across my mouth and everything I mean everything became ice cold, I could even see my breath but I couldn't move or speak. She was just standing there with her hand on my mouth looking down on me and there wasn't a thing I could do. I remembered reading some where that if you asked a spirit what it wants it will leave. So not being able to speak, I thought it and the spirit just shook her head and was gone. Now you don't have to be a believer to know what I did next, you guessed it, I ran from the room and right to my mothers who told me I was just having a bad dream. The next morning we received a phone call from the hospital that my dad had passed away. I didn't know who the woman was at that time, but I believe she came to let me know that my dad wasn't coming home. I only found out a few years ago after speaking with a Native American shaman that the spirit was that of my great grandmother.

Sally Ann,"Kentucky, United States",Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: Sally Ann

S elling real estate is an adventure unto itself.  Sellers and buyers are always full of surprises, but occasionally the homes hold a few on their own.  In April 1989, I did not believe in ghosts.  No real reason to.  It wasn't logical.  But unfortunately, this story is true.

That spring, I listed a beautiful 200 years old Italianate Mansion on six acres. The home was halfway through renovations when the owner gave me my first tour.  We walked through the grand entryway separating the twin front parlors.  The one on the left served as the living room.  A beautiful antique grand piano nearly filled the music room in the right parlor.

A large formal dining room and just beyond, and a renovated gourmet kitchen and bath finished the first floor tour.  We walked up the wide curved staircase in the center of the home, circling to the third floor tower.  The tower was one room, surrounded by windows, where one could overlook the entire farm and surrounding countryside.

Heading down to the second floor, five of the bedrooms were in various stages of construction, that is, all but one.  The sixth bedroom, painted a sunny yellow with white trim was left untouched.  The owner explained that room couldn't be changed.  If they tried to paint it, the new paint faded and the yellow walls greeted them again the next morning.  The temperature in that one room was a constant seventy degrees no matter what season.  It was the young son's room of the owners in the late 1800's and she said he was one of the ghosts in the house.  When you walked in that room, you felt a presence. As if someone was there. It was a calm presence, but it felt as if eyes were on you.  I wanted out of that room, but I don't believe in ghosts.

According to the owner, sightings had been seen of a young boy, a man, and two men while only her family was at home. While the workmen were there, tools disappeared all over the home, never to be seen again.  Noises of something being dragged and footsteps coming from upstairs while the workmen were downstairs were reported.  I, of course, totally discounted the stories because I don't believe in ghosts.

""Goodbye."" I said to my new client.  ""It's been a most enjoyable afternoon."" I left, excited about my unique historical listing and couldn't wait for my first open house in two weeks.

The day of the open house was beautiful, sixty degrees, and sunny.  Tools were put away.  The home gleamed.  Visitors entered in the kitchen door where they sampled homemade donuts, mint iced tea and coffee while they waited for one of two agents to take them on a tour.  The agent then let the prospective buyer out the front door and returned to the kitchen for the next visitor.

Towards the end of the three hour opening, I let a very nice woman out the front door where a cold breeze hit me when I closed the door. Turning to go back to the kitchen, I glanced to my right.  Sitting at the piano in the music room was a young woman, dressed in a plain gray dress, her dark hair drawn back in a bun. Her large dark eyes held no light. She was sitting quietly, just looking down at the keys. No music was playing. The hair on the back of my neck rose with the goose bumps.  Startled by seeing a visitor unattended, I went back to the kitchen to find the other agent.

""Why is there someone wandering around the house without you?""

""Well, maybe she came in the front door,"" I acquiesced.  ""In that case, there is a lady waiting for you in the music room.""

As I described her, the owner smiled.  ""You've just met Sally Ann.""

The hair on the nape of my neck stood up and I broke out in goose bumps yet again as I raced back to the front rooms. The music room was empty.  The living area also empty.  I ran up the stairs.  The bedrooms were empty.  Only one place left, the tower.  Taking the stairs two at a time, I reached the door.  It squeaked as it slowly opened it.  Empty. She was gone.  Vanished.  My heart pounding, I was shaking as I slowly descended the staircase and walked back to the kitchen.  This was silly.  I don't believe in ghosts.

Reaching the kitchen, I sat down and the owner pushed a cup of strong coffee in front of me.  My hands were trembling and the hot liquid nearly spilled.  The owner began to tell me the story of Sally Ann.

""Sally Ann, her husband, brother-in-law, and eight year old son were the original owners of the home.  Sally Ann had an affair with her husband's brother and when he found out, the two men dueled in the hallway of the second floor.  Both men died as a result of their wounds.  Sally Ann's son died a year later of typhoid.  Sally died at the young age of 30 of what was said to be a broken heart.  She shows herself only to people she approves of as guests in her home. But she is a kind ghost and is treated as another member of the family. Every once in awhile we see her son with her.  The two brothers are probably the ones responsible for the tools missing.  Just haven't seen them.""

I'm thinking - great, Sally likes me. But I don't believe in ghosts.

The owner continued her story.  ""I hired a seer to come evaluate the ghost situation.  He identified all of the ghosts.  The family is all buried at Lexington Cemetery.  He told me to rent a metal detector and search around the fifth fence post from the front corner of the house.  I would find Sally Ann's wedding ring.  So I did.  And two feet down, I found her wedding ring with her initials.  It's in this drawer.""

Walking to the sideboard, she opened a drawer and pulled out a small band with initials on the inside.  My breath caught.  The hairs on my arm stood up.

Some deep breathing helped, mind over matter, and calmer now, I had again convinced myself that Sally Ann or whatever it was, was merely a figment of my imagination.  It was just an old ring. I don't believe in ghosts.

I had finished my coffee, and since the Open House was now over, the other agent and I prepared to leave.  As we neared the front door, I felt a cool breeze.  The goose bumps returned.  The hair on the nape of my neck stood up.  Chills went down my spine.  Slowly I turned around.  At the top of the stairs stood Sally Ann.  She was smiling.

The owner had told me where the family was buried at the Cemetery and because I am annoyingly curious, I later went to visit.  There they all were.  The whole family. Just as she said.  Still a cynic, I went to the historic archives to search for the stories.  They were there.  The seer's stories checked out.  There was a picture of the widow.  It was Sally Ann.

Popeye's Ghost,"California, United States",Apparitions / Voices / Touches,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Apparitions / Voices / Touches :: Popeye's Ghost

H i everyone. My Name is Casey and I am 49 years old. When I was six years old I lived on 15th St. in Santa Monica, Ca. We were living in a house that was built by Segar, the creator of the Popeye cartoon.

One evening my older brother and sister and I walked home from a diner down the street before the folks came home. This was during an era when kids could walk home without the adults.

When we got home my brother discovered we had no house key. My brother took me around back and boosted me through the kitchen window so I could go through the house to open the front door. On my way down the hall I passed the narrow stairs that went up to the upper floor.

I looked up those stairs and at the top stood this cartoon looking person looking down at me. It was wildly shaking its head and made this strange laughing sound. I wasn't so scared, I've always been kind of strange that way.

I ran to the front door and let in my siblings. I told them what happened and they both understood. Each one of them had encounters with this malevolent spirit in the past.

Heritage Hall,Canada,Apparitions / Voices / Touches,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Apparitions / Voices / Touches :: Heritage Hall

I used to attend L'Heritage high school in Sudbury Ontario, it was a completely normal place. Normal students, normal teachers, normal everything. Until one day, our school closed because we didn't have enough students enrolled in L'Heritage. We ended up closing down. The school basically sat there until elementary school ""St Johns"" of Garson had to rent out L'Heritage due to some ventilation problems. Me and a few others went into the school to clean it up a bit. We were there all day, until by friends and I had cleaned the whole school. They all left except for me. I stayed to finish up a classroom. Later on I decided to retire for the day. I walked out into the hallway and I heared footsteps behind me. I turned, but no one was there. I began to think that one of my friends had come back to prank me. ""Very funny guys"" I continued on, then I heard the footsteps again. I began to run until I heard a scream. I stopped, then felt the need to escape like something was pushing me out. I ran out of the school and quickly drove away. I sometimes wonder if any of the St John students have had the same experience that I had.

Sleep Interupted by Spirits,"Ohio, United States",Old Hags / Night Attacks / Sleep Paralysis,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Old Hags / Night Attacks / Sleep Paralysis :: Sleep Interupted by Spirits

F irst things first, I know about sleep paralysis and night terrors. What I experienced was neither of these. I had moved in with my mom and her boyfriend into a very old farm house. I had noticed shortly after moving in that I could hear voices, male voices mainly about the same time every night. At first I attributed these to my Mom or her boyfriend leaving on a TV or radio, but after speaking with them and doing some investigation on my own, one night I determined that I was wrong.

Then I started waking up in the middle of the night, not being able to move or speak. This went on for a few months off and on, but it began to happen more frequently as time went by. I was often able to move after saying the Lords prayer or one of the psalms, now I am not a deeply religous person but I believed this helped me. Things really got bad near the end, I was waking up in this conditon almost every night. One night, as it was happening, my mother walked into the room, I saw and heard her walk in, but I could do nothing until I said the prayer, she said that she could hear me saying something but couldn't make out what it was and that the closer she got to me the colder the air felt. I told her what was going on and she said she had experienced the same thing a few times since moving in there.

Well the next night I awoke to the same thing happening, I was asleep on my side and I felt someone put their hand on my shoulder which immediately woke me up, once again I was unable to move or to speak, like what ever it was didn't want me to see it. I willed myself to roll over and confront what ever it was holding me down and to my surprise, in front of my face was the face of an old woman, no body, nothing, just her face and she screamed at me: ""what do I do now"". Well being as mad as I was I told her to leave me the (blank) alone and go into the light. When I did this she gave me a puzzled look and disappeared.

After that I never had another incident. I did some investigating of the home and wasn't able to find out if anyone had died there or not. Now that I think back on it I guess I could have been a little more polite to this spirit, but hey after several months of interrupted sleep who can blame me.

The Others,Philippines,Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: The Others

I t was nearly 7 p.m. when we reached my friend's grandmother's house in the province near our school. We were there to spend the night doing our thesis required to finish our course. There were seven in the group.

The house belonged to Melissa's grandmother. No one was in there aside from a caretaker who left after he handed us the key. We suited ourselves and prepared our dinner. After the meal, we started to do our projects. It was already 2 a.m. when we finished and decided to go to bed.

There were three rooms in the house. We were four girls and three boys, so we took the other room, while the boys took the room on the other side. The other one left was Melissa's grandmother's room.

Before going to bed, Andrea, one of our friends, asked Melissa about the house. She told us that her third eye was open, and she felt something in there. We were frightened of what she said and told her to stop bullying us. But Melissa said that the house was known in the town as being haunted, since no one really stayed there. Her grandmother was staying with her family, since she was too old to be alone in that house.

Suddenly we felt as if someone were watching us. We went to the room and decided to sleep. Around 5 a.m., Andrea woke me; she was chilled and could not control it. She asked us if we could leave already, but it was too early, and we wanted to sleep late. I told her to go back to sleep again.

She said she couldn't, and could I just come with her outside. She just need some air to breathe. I wanted to scream at her, but when I looked at her, she was white, as if she had no blood running in her veins.

I woke up the rest of the girls. Andrea was already freaking out and crying. We went outside, and Melissa gave her some water. She calmed down a little and started to tell us the story that scared us and gave us total chills to the bone.

When we went to bed, we went to sleep fast, since we were all tired, but Andrea could not sleep. She heard noises like footsteps outside the rooms and whispering. She ignored it and went to sleep. It was if there were ""other"" people in the house, but she still fell asleep.

She awakened at around quarter to four, and what she told us next scared us to death and made our blood run cold. She said that she closed her eyes and tried to get some sleep again, but she still couldn't.

When she opened her eyes, she saw a lady in front of her, looking down at her face! She smiled at her wickedly and said, ""You can see us, can't you?"" The ""other"" people then came near around her. That's when she woke me, chilled and crying.

We waited till the sunrise, packed our things and went back to the city. None of the boys knew what had happened. No one would surely believe, so why waste our energy telling them? After all, we were still drained when we reached our dorm.

Startling Knocks At My Window,"South Carolina, United States",Misc,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Misc :: Startling Knocks At My Window

I have a habit of being awake in the wee hours of the morning on a fairly regular basis. This particular morning I was up late working on some music projects. I had my earbuds in listening to a track when suddenly I heard 3 loud rapid knocks right at the window behind my bed's headboard.

It scared the living s#!+ out of me! Startled, I snatched out my earbuds and laid low for a brief moment wondering who in the h*! Could be knocking on my window at this time of the morning. This has never happened before so I'm there ducked down trying to process what just happened.

In those brief moments my mind is racing and I thought for a second could it have been one of my household relatives that went outside and perhaps locked themselves out? Then I thought could it be someone from around the neighborhood up to no good or perhaps needing something?

Then I thought that maybe I was hearing things, but the knocking was LOUD and I actually felt the THUD of the window. That's actually what got my attention, and it was loud enough that I heard it beyond my earbuds.

I quickly jumped out of bed and grabbed my pistol. I then slowly peeped out the blinds of the window to see if anyone was out there but oddly there was no one there.

That side of the house is well lit by a nearby street light and my car was right there next to that window. Still peeping out the window I looked around the car and waited to see if maybe someone was hiding behind it on the other side, but I didn't see anyone. I angled my gaze downward to see if anyone might have ducked down below the window alongside the house but no one was in sight.

I then went out of my bedroom and slowly peaked around the corner into the front room to see if by chance anyone else was awake and happened to make a loud noise which I thought was at the window, but came from another part of the house instead. However, I saw that they were all sound asleep, snoring loudly.

I then peaked out the blinds in the front room (where my relatives were sleeping) to look out in the yard but I saw no one in the yard. If someone were to flee it would've took them a few minutes to get far enough to exit the yard, and they would've been well in view of the street light.

I went back in my bedroom and looked at the clock on my laptop. I saw it was 2:48, right before 3am (which is said to be ""Witching Hour""). At this point I'm on edge and starting to think that it may have been something paranormal happening.

For the sake of protection I burned some sage and told whatever it was to leave me alone and return where it came from.

I laid back down in bed on edge for the remainder of the morning until daybreak, but nothing else ever did happen.

The following night came and I again, was awake in the wee hours. Naturally I was on edge waiting for something to happen again but nothing ever did.

Rumor Or Real?,Japan,Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: Rumor Or Real?

T here is a small Japanese-style washoku restaurant I sometimes go to. It is an old place with a wooden sign and a sliding door. Inside the floor is covered with tatami, the tables are low, and the smell of grilled fish and dashi hangs in the air. The menu is fixed, with set meals of rice, miso soup, simmered vegetables, pickles, and fish.

People in the neighborhood have spoken about the place for years. They say that if you stay there too late, unusual things begin to happen. I never believed it until one night I went there with my friend.

It was close to closing time. The dining room was empty except for us. The waitress came to take our orders, bowed politely, and walked quickly down the corridor toward the kitchen. Her footsteps echoed unnaturally against the floor.

While we waited, the light above our table flickered. We both looked up, then shrugged it off. A few minutes later, a clatter broke the silence. A pair of chopsticks had fallen onto the tatami from the table next to ours. The strange thing was that no one had been sitting there.

Not long after, I felt a tap on my shoulder. It was light, like the touch of a waiter. I turned, but no one was there. When I looked forward again, the waitress was just then coming out of the kitchen, carrying our trays with both hands.

We ate quietly. The food was the same as always, but the silence of the room pressed down on us. After the last orders were served, the kitchen lights went out. I heard the faint sound of pans being stacked, and then there was nothing.

Suddenly a loud crash echoed from the kitchen. A pan had fallen to the floor. No one moved and no one spoke. The kitchen remained dark.

When the waitress returned with the bill, she said nothing about it. She bowed as usual, but I noticed her hand shaking slightly.

We paid quickly and left. As the sliding door closed behind us, the light above the entrance flickered once.

Later I tried to learn more about the rumors. I discovered that about fifty years ago, the owner of the restaurant had a violent quarrel with his wife. He struck her, not realizing she was pregnant. The baby was lost. The woman's mind gave way after that. Some time later she killed him in the restaurant's kitchen.

It is said that the man still lingers in the dining room, and the woman remains in the kitchen, waiting for the one who took her child.

When I think back to the tap on my shoulder and the chopsticks falling from the empty table, I cannot help wondering which one of them it was...

"Did They Fade, Or Do They Remain?",Japan,Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: Did They Fade, Or Do They Remain?

I live in Hokkaido, and my yard used to have an old well. It had been there long before I moved in, tucked away behind shrubs and an aging shed. I rarely used it, maybe only only once in a while for watering plants? But otherwise it sat quietly, almost forgotten.

The area where I live has long had a reputation for being haunted. Over the years I've grown used to it. Sometimes, in the middle of the night, faint voices can be heard, like distant prayers carried on the wind. They've weakened as time has passed, and I've come to accept them as part of the atmosphere here.

But what happened when I arranged to close the well felt entirely different.

In the days leading up to the ceremony, strange things began to occur. At night, dogs from far-off homes barked and howled in the direction of my property, though there was nothing visible in the yard. Inside my own house, I would wake to muffled knocking sounds, low and insistent, as though coming from beneath the ground.

The night before the priest was due to arrive, I saw something I still can't explain. At dusk, I noticed a shape near the well. At first it looked like an animal crouched close to the ground, but as I focused on it, the form seemed to stretch upward, taking on the blurred outline of a person. It never came into focus... Always shadowy, indistinct... Before vanishing altogether. When I went to check, the ground around the stones was damp, though it hadn't rained in days.

On the morning of the ceremony, the air in the yard felt unusually heavy, as though the place itself was holding its breath. The priest performed the purification, but later admitted it had been harder than usual, as if something resisted the prayers.

When the ritual was finished and the well was sealed, the disturbances ceased. The dogs grew quiet, the knocking sounds never returned, and I haven't seen that shadowy figure again.

Even so, the memory lingers. The distant prayers that sometimes drift through my area feel familiar now, almost harmless. But the things I experienced during the well-closing were different... Very active, immediate, and unsettling in a way I won't soon forget.

Do you think the spirits tied to the well are still here, or did they fade away like the voices of those midnight prayers?

A Haunted Well,India,Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: A Haunted Well

"" This is something that happened to my mother around 45 - 50 years ago...""

During her childhood, my mother used to spend her summer holidays in a small village called Naginenipally, at her eldest sister-in-law's house. Like most children of her age, she was playful, curious, and a little adventurous.

In that village, there was an old well that everyone whispered about. The elders often warned children to stay away from it, saying it was haunted. Naturally, this only fueled the curiosity of the kids.

One day, when all the elders were busy with work, my mother and her close friend slipped away to see the well for themselves. They played around it for some time. Neither of them knew how to swim, so they never dared to get too close. But then something terrifying happened.

Out of nowhere, a woman draped in a black saree appeared. She was carrying burning coal wrapped in her saree, yet the cloth did not catch fire. With a swift motion, she threw the burning coal in front of the children. Shocked and terrified, the two girls ran back to the house, trembling with fear.

Days later, despite the incident, their curiosity got the better of them. They returned to the well. But this time, what they experienced was even more chilling.

From deep inside the well, they began to hear a voice calling out the name of my mother's friend. At first faint, it grew louder and louder, echoing through the air until it felt unbearably close.

The girls fled in horror. That very night, my mother's friend developed a high fever. Even as she lay in her home, she claimed to hear the same voice calling her name again and again.

Though her fever eventually subsided, she never recovered from the fear. Within a few days... She passed away.

I Would Have Been Late,Canada,Family / Friends Visits,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Family / Friends Visits :: I Would Have Been Late

M y Mother passed away in April 2022, though I have been thinking to share the interesting events that happened around that trying time, today I'm going to write about a little help she gave me this morning.

Today I had to go to work to a place a bit far from where I live and one of my coworkers was to pick me up at 6:00 AM.

Since this is way too early for the time I usually get up, I decided to sleep in my daughter's bedroom so not to disturb my husband's sleep. I prepared my stuff and a good lunch and set the alarm with enough time to let me get ready, have a good breakfast and tend to the cat's needs before leaving, I thought one hour and 20 minutes would be enough time to do everything without rushing.

Anyway, at some point I had a dream, perhaps even a nightmare, in which I was going to get together with my friends from university, they arrived at my place and I wasn't ready. I began looking for something to wear but couldn't find anything suitable, mismatched socks, flowery blouses and plaid skirts and homely dresses that would had made me look like a pauper beside my elegantly dressed friends.

I went out and told my friends that I'd be ready in two minutes, but was moving with the speed of a snail and knew I would make everyone else late for whatever event we were attending.

My parents were watching me from the background, and Mom said ""Se te va a hacer tarde"" (You are going to be late).

Hearing her voice was enough to wake me up startled, I checked my phone, it was 4:23 AM, still a bit earlier than the time I had set the alarm. I stayed few more minutes in bed but decided to turn off the alarm and get up. To my horror, I realized that I had set the alarm at 5:40 AM instead of 4:40 as I had intended!

Strange Voices In The Mountains,Japan,Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: Strange Voices In The Mountains

I went camping for two nights at a small site up in the mountains, next to a slow-moving stream. The water ran clear over stones, and deer wandered through the area occasionally, which is normal in Hokkaido. The air smelled damp and earthy, with a faint hint of pine.

I rode up on my side-car. The road was quiet, and the forest on either side felt still, but the ride itself was normal.

The first night was uneventful. I heard only the stream, the occasional rustle of leaves, and a few distant birds.

The second night was different. I woke sometime after midnight because the forest felt unusually still. The stream was quieter, and then I heard voices.

At first, they were faint, blending with the water. But it was clear they were human voices, not animal sounds. One voice, soft and high-pitched, sounded like a woman speaking in short, broken phrases. It drifted slowly through the area, fading in and out. I stayed still and listened. After a few minutes, the voices faded completely, leaving only the stream.

When I was leaving the next morning, I mentioned it to the caretaker. He didn't look surprised. He said quietly that people sometimes hear things in that part of the mountain, and that in the past, a few people have gone missing there. He didn't give any details, and I didn't ask.

I don't know what I heard that night. Maybe it was someone lost, maybe it was just the way sound carries in the forest. But the voices by the stream have stayed with me. What do you think those voices are? Are they victims or some sort of night creatures?

"Move To San Francisco, A Very Haunted City","California, United States",Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: Move To San Francisco, A Very Haunted City

O oookay, I was totally joking at the end of my last post when I said I'd post again in five years. But here it is, five years later. Looks like I'm going to be unintentionally posting every five years on here.

On 29 June 2021, I moved to San Francisco. It's where I'd always wanted to move, but couldn't for various reasons. Well, a really good friend of mine told me that I could live with them. They lived with their family and their family said I could stay until the end of the year, then I'd have to find my own place. That seemed perfectly fair.

In 2017, their grandmother passed away. I always assumed she passed away in the hospital because I remembered my friend telling me they rushed her to the hospital, and a few days later they told me she passed. But every time I was by the bathroom in front of her old room, I'd get this strange feeling there was a presence. That little hallway had that feeling. It didn't feel evil or scary, it actually felt calming. I told my friend, and they said, ""That's Baachan. She's watching over us"". My friend is Japanese and that's the term they call their grandmother. I asked if she passed in the hospital like I thought, and they said, ""No, she hated it there. We brought her home to rest in her own bed, and she passed away that night"".

However, the basement was another story. Or rather... First floor? Basements are weird here in San Francisco. In their house and the one I'm currently living, there are steps leading to second floor, which acts as the first floor. The ground floor is considered a basement even though it's fully above ground. I've lived here four years, and I'm still confused by it. I live on the third floor but it's technically the second floor...

Anyway, we had to go to the basement to do laundry. We never liked being down there because the air felt thick and evil. My friend's family had bought the house back in the 1950s and their mother had grown up in it, and she told me it was like that when she was a little girl. She hated being down there and doesn't go down there unless she has to. I asked if something happened down there and she said if it did it was before her family bought the house, but it definitely feels like some really bad energy is down there.

So, I got a job there, saved up and moved into my current house on 5 January 2022. I'm renting a room in a house, and it's a really nice neighbourhood in the Richmond. That's not doxing myself, the Richmond is fifty blocks long and like ten blocks wide. It's a very big area.

It didn't take me long to notice that the house was haunted. At least the hallway. Even in the daytime I feel like something is chasing me when I walk down it and I rush back to my room. A friend of mine looked up this address on SF Chronicles archives and found out there had been a murder here in the '80s. There weren't any specific details like if it was in the top floor hallway or something. But that's the only thing we found that could explain it.

There are four rooms on my floor. My room is at the end of the hall facing the outside. I look out my window and see the street. The room next to mine, there was someone living there when I moved out. He moved out a year into me living here and someone else moved in, he's still here. The room at the end of the hall, the same person has lived there since before I moved in. I mention all this to talk about the last room. I call it the middle room even though there are four rooms. I guess it'd be the middle room in that hall, since mine is at the end of the hall. Anyway, I've always called it the cursed room. The guy who was living there when I moved in moved out a month later. In the three and a half years I've lived in this house, we've had six different people move in and out. The short time was two weeks. I came home from work and he was moving his stuff out. I asked what was going on and he just said, ""I can't do this anymore"". I asked what he meant and he just repeated it. The current tenant there seems to be paranoid. When he moved in a couple months ago, he told me that he had to move out of his last place because his landlord was having the tenants spy on him. I was like, ""Oh, that's messed up!"". But then he started talking about hidden cameras in his room and I felt like maybe his last landlord didn't have him spied on. A couple weeks ago I was coming up the stairs from taking out the trash. His room is directly in front of the stairs, and as I was nearing the top, he opened his door and told me I needed to stop standing outside his door listening in. I was confused and he said, ""Don't bother denying it, I caught you three times"". The other way I was coming up the stairs from talking with a friend at the front door who had come to pick up something. As I was nearing the top he threw open his door and startled me. I laughed and told him he startled me. He goes, ""I told you to stay out of my room! You need to leave me alone!"". Honestly, I don't know if that has anything to do with the activity here or if he's just mentally ill, but I honestly wouldn't be surprised if there was a presence outside his room and he thinks it's one of us.

Something happened a couple of days ago that made me want to write all this down. Our bathroom is split between two rooms. Okay, from my room looking down the hall, on the left side are my roommates' rooms. On the left side is an empty closet, the stairs, and the two bathroom doors, and the kitchen at the end of the hall. The first bathroom is literally just the toilet, the size of a porta-potty. Really tiny. The second door is the shower and sink. It sounds inconvenient, but with four people living there, it's been very convenient. Anyway, a couple days ago I was in the first bathroom and I could hear someone taking a shower. I could see the light on, and the windows were open and I could very clearly hear the shower going. I was thinking to myself, ""I'll just wash my hands in the kitchen"", like we usually do in that situation. Well, I leave the bathroom, the sound still going and light still on through the window, and when I close the door behind me... The second bathroom door is open, and the light is off and no one is in there. No shower going, the floor and walls are dry. I stood there, my blood frozen. It was seriously eerie.

Okay, that's enough about my living haunting situations. I'll talk about my San Francisco working haunting situations. That's a weird wording, but I'm going to keep it.

First job I got was on Fisherman's Wharf at a souvenir shop standing outside going, ""Everything is $10!"". That was literally my entire job. That's the job that paid for me to move out of my friend's house. But a week after I moved into this house, the store abruptly closed. I frantically looked for another one and was lucky enough to find one with one day left in the month. My landlord is very understanding. It was an organic market on Polk, and I loved it there. A lot of the friends I have made here were either coworkers there or regular customers there. A minor celebrity was a regular there and she and I talked every week. It was so much fun working there! Even if it was haunted like crazy! There was the obvious stuff like stuff falling off shelves that weren't near the edge, stuff moving around or not where we left them. There were times we saw figures cross between aisles even though we knew no one else was in the store. I even had a similar experience that happened in Ohio. A coworker and I were discussing the hauntings, and a loaf of bread flew off the shelf and hit the counter. We decided to change the subject. The same thing happened in Ohio except it was a bag of chips.

In 2023 the store was bought by another, bigger store and closed down and we were all let go. I had saved up thousands of dollars by then, which was lucky because that paid my rent until I got another job in March 2024. My current job, in fact. I'm a photographer at a landmark. Obviously not going to say which one. We take pictures of guests as they enter and try to sell them souvenir sets of their photos as they leave. We all know the area is haunted, but it's hard to prove because we're outside. We just know mostly because we can feel it. There were two incidents that really solidified it, though. Several months ago, I opened up (I'm a lead there) and when I unlocked the office there were photo cards everywhere. I called the person who closed the night before and asked them what the heck happened. He was completely confused; it wasn't like that when he left. I knew he was lying so I had to report it to my district manager. An hour later she texted me a video showing that... It wasn't him. Oh, the photo cards are cards with QR codes we scan when we take the pictures and hand to the guests. There are 1,000 in each box. Anyway, there was an open box on the table in the office and in the middle of the night, they started flying out of the box of their own accord. I asked her if I could share the video and she said absolutely not. What's with corporate not wanting these things getting out? Honestly, I think that'd give us more visitors.

The other thing that happened was we often hear our names called from behind the sales area. There will be no one over there and one of us will hear our name being called from back there. No one else can hear it, but almost all of us have heard it. Even the skeptical ones have heard it, though they have tried to dismiss it as the wind. But it even happens when the wind isn't blowing, or even no breeze. The air could be still and we'll still hear it. It's always eerie. I've been working there for a year and a half and have heard it many times and am not used to it. We had a sixteen-year-old girl start working there last year. I was standing next to her on her first night and she suddenly screamed. I jumped and asked what happened. She said, ""I heard someone saying my name!"" and she ran behind the sales area and screamed again because no one was back there. I involuntarily laughed and said, ""Oh, you'll get used to that"", even though like I said I'm still not used to it. Needless to say, she quit after about a week. She said it was because she hated working outside, though.

I'm going to end this by talking about something nobody likes talking about. I've walked the Golden Gate Bridge so many times now that I don't even take pictures every time anymore. It's just a large bridge that just happens to be one of the most famous in the world. No big deal. But as I'm sure everyone knows, it's well-known for the unfortunately high number of people who have jumped off of it over the course of its existence. I don't know if you've walked on it, but you can definitely feel it when you're walking on it. There's an air of sadness when you're walking across it. No matter what I'm doing, be it listening to happy music or in a call with my best friend, there's an unmistakable feeling of sadness, dread, and regret when walking on that bridge. I've never specifically seen anything, but I think it's because I'm kind of sensitive to that sort of thing that I feel it so much. I've walked it with a friend of mine once who isn't sensitive to the paranormal and she didn't feel anything. Heck, at this point, I don't even know if what I feel on the bridge is even paranormal anymore. There's been so many jumpers over the past century, those emotions are essentially baked in by now. They have nets in place now so there have been less attempts lately. Someone did jump a couple months ago. I saw him lying on the net refusing help. Last I saw, they were guiding him off. So, the nets are definitely saving lives. Either as a deterrent or by literally catching people who try.

Is Someone Visiting?,"Texas, United States",Family / Friends Visits,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Family / Friends Visits :: Is Someone Visiting?

I t has been a VERY LONG time since I have visited YGS and had someone not reached out to me via FB I am not sure I would have returned, but here I am and a BIG thank you to the individual who reached out to me.

2024 was not a good year for myself or Family. In January we saw the passing of my Mother. Her health had been in decline (heart issues) and was in assisted living in the Dallas Tx area. In May we received the 'midnight' phone call that wakes you from your peace. My Oldest Son (Lawrence) had collapsed at work, he worked 3rd shift (overnights) at a Local Floor and Decor, and was pronounced dead at the scene. He had suffered a Bi-lateral pulmonary embolism. My Father -in-Law, who's health was failing (Type 1 Diabetes Complications) moved in us in June, by the first week of August he was placed on Home Hospice and passed away later that same month (yes, he passed in my house).

In the year since, some 'odd' things have happened either to individuals in the household or with-in the house itself.

1st: When home alone I hear someone moving upstairs in my Son's old room. I 'played' it off as it being our dog (a 13-14 year old 50-60 pound Huskey with a bad hip) only to realize he was at my feet as I sat on the couch. A quick 'cat check' shows that both of out cats are also in the living room with me.

2nd: Each Family member has felt Lawrence's presence at one time or another, up to and including hearing his voice saying something... Not sure if this is just us remembering how he would speak with us or if he is actually interacting with us still, but it's defiantly his 'sarcastic' / snarky type comments.

3rd: Not sure how people feel about seeing individuals that have crossed over in their dreams, but my Wife has had two very vivid dreams about Lawrence, she describes them as 'feeling' real. The first one he was comforting her because he had passed away, he assured her that 'he was needed' on the other side... The next day is when we received the coroner's report detailing what had caused his death... A pulmonary embolism, is enough to take someone, he had suffered a Bi-Lateral (one in both Lungs) Pulmonary Embolism and there was nothing that could have been done to prevent it. The other dream she described was 'just as real' but he was simply comforting her, at least that's all she could remember about it.

So, there it is... 2024 was a very rough year for our Family, still dealing with so, so many things from last year, but making progress. Thanks for reading.

Am I Losing The Plot?,United Kingdom,Misc,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Misc :: Am I Losing The Plot?

A t the end of May this year, I lost my umbrella. This fact had me very confused as I do not use my umbrella very much, and usually use it to walk to the gym when it's raining. Just as info, I have zero psychic ability. None. But I have been reading stories on YGS for over 10 years as I find the subject interesting.

I looked everywhere for this umbrella. I live in a Victorian terrace with limited space so there are a finite number of places to look. I even went to my car and checked in there. On the back seat of my car, behind the driver, I keep two cloth shopping bags and I moved them out of the way to look at the back seat (even though I can't imagine why I would put it on the back seat) but I saw nothing. Each week these 2 bags would be used and returned to the same spot. Shortly before I was due to go on holiday the 3rd week of June, I returned my bags to the back seat and there sat my umbrella. I was quite nonplussed. I was sure that I had carefully looked at the back seat weeks before. I park as close to my front door as I am able because parking is first come first served.

I got back from my holiday, and on June 3rd I was making something to eat, and reached into a lower cupboard for a can of baked beans. I always have baked beans - they are a staple. My hand grabbed air. I bent down to have a look, stuck my hand into the space where there should have been cans, put my arm all the way to the back and zilch. No beans. I was really surprised that I had run out as I hate running out of anything. Next day when I did some shopping I bought a couple of cans to go in the cupboard. When I tried to insert the new cans I heard a clink. I looked into the cupboard and there were two cans of beans there. As you can imagine, I was beginning to wonder if I was losing the plot.

On the 10th of July (and this is where I went back and wrote dates down) I took a bus to meet someone for coffee in a town about 3 miles away. While I was on the bus I looked at my hands and noticed that I had not put on my rings and bangle. A few months ago I realized that I really should wear my jewelery more as it was silly to leave it in the jewelry box, so I had two rings resized and started wearing them more. The only problem is that at times the rings and bangle get really annoying. When home, I often put them on my computer desk and put them on from there before I go out. If they annoy me when I am out I pull them off, and slip them into the front zip pocket of my shoulder bag. I thought about when I had last seen the jewelry and could not remember seeing the pieces by the pc before I left, so I thought that perhaps I had forgotten to take them out of my handbag after the last time I wore them. I unzipped the front pouch, which is probably about 25cm x 20cm, slid my hand back and forth and resolved to look for the rings and bangle when I got home as the pocket was empty. Had my coffee, got on the bus to go home and started to put my bus pass into the front zip pocket. As soon as I slipped my hand in, I felt my bangle which is gold and fairly heavy and noticeable, and the rings were there too.

After the beans incident I had started to wonder if I had a spirit in my home with me, and the jewelry incident really reinforced that thought except for one thing. I was a couple of miles from home when I found the empty pocket, and about 3 miles away from home when I could feel my stuff again. And this is where I really started to wonder if I was losing it. How did ""my"" spirit know that I would be looking for my jewelry on the bus, and how did it put it back in for me when I was not at home? Can these entities move around with you?

I have been meaning to set up an account here, but I am a great procrastinator. Yesterday I was sitting in my recliner for a few minutes before going out. I had been ready to post everything after I set up an account, but I procrastinated for a couple of weeks, and then yesterday something new happened. I leave my Kindle Fire on the arm of my recliner. It was unplugged and to my left while I checked something out before leaving. I looked over and it turned on. Now, if there is no power plugged in, I must hold the power button to a 5 count before it turns on, so somebody was trying to be helpful, which it would have been if not for the fact I was going out.

I am of an age where quite a few people have Alzheimers and/or dementia, and I really would rather not join that group, so if someone with more knowledge than me would care to comment on the question of can spirits follow you around locally, I would be relieved if some do and that I am still sane.

A Shadow In The Forest,Japan,Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: A Shadow In The Forest

I have lived in Hokkaido for ten years. A few days before the event, I visited Nibutani, a village where the Ainu people preserve their culture and traditions. An elder told me about Ke-saru, a spirit said to live deep in the forest and watch those who enter.

He explained,""Ke-saru doesn't chase people, but it watches carefully. If someone is careless or disrespectful, it takes more than just fear.""

The name Ke-saru means""face peeler""in the Ainu language, referring to the spirit's dangerous nature toward those who show arrogance or disrespect in the forest.

Before I left, the elder taught me a prayer to say if I ever felt the spirit nearby,""Kamuy ceppesuy."" This means,""Spirit, please return to your home."" The Ainu believe that spirits called kamuy live in all parts of nature, animals, plants, rivers, and the wind.

While hiking alone in the Hidaka Mountains, the air suddenly became cold. All birds singing, wind rustling leaves stopped completely. Then, I saw a dark shape moving slowly between the trees. It was too large and moved too quietly to be a bear or any animal I know around.

At that moment, I felt a heavy pressure and had difficulty breathing. Remembering the elder's words, I whispered the prayer,""Kamuy ceppesuy.""

For several seconds, the Shadow stayed still before silently disappearing into the darkness.

When I returned to Nibutani and told the elder what happened, he said, ""It saw you. You are lucky it let you go.""

Since then, I have avoided walking alone in that part of the forest. The silence and shadows are not just empty, they feel like something is watching.

Did I encounter the Ke-saru or can anyone explain what happened?

Spirits From Ripley's,"Florida, United States",Ghost Tours & Haunted Hotels,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Ghost Tours & Haunted Hotels :: Spirits From Ripley's

R ipley's Believe It Or Not seems to have more than just artifacts from different locations around the world. Some seem to be there from the Paranormal Realm, which I had the opportunity to investigate and experience.

Just like at the Old Jail, you go through a little bit of an introduction, a run over of the gear that they have to let you use, then you are released to investigate the building. I was not expecting all the activity that we had the opportunity to witness, and it definitely itched the scratch of wanting to get some interactions to see if there was paranormal activity.

This location gave more EVP evidence than anything else. Which part of it was receiving the name Steve a few times. Then there was a time frame where it said ""switch"", which I was there with a friend, and asked if it wanted me to hand the spirit box to my friend, which we received the response ""yes"" and it then proceeded to whistle at him a few times.

At this location, we were not receiving very many spirit orbs, but was a lot more heavy on the Voice Phenomena when we were asking questions. Now the one time that I had some concern was mentioning that I was going to go downstairs, and got a very heavy, deep, angry sounding NO! Response through the spirit box, which, much to say, I did not go downstairs at that point.

Then towards the end of the investigation, we were standing in one of the exhibits and received the response ""Die"" or ""Will Die"" and at that point my buddy as well as myself were like, nope we are stepping out of this room and going elsewhere.

Either way, that was my first investigation before doing the Old Jail investigation and hope that you guys enjoyed reading this.

Ghosts Of The Old Jail,"Florida, United States",Ghost Tours & Haunted Hotels,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Ghost Tours & Haunted Hotels :: Ghosts Of The Old Jail

I figured I would share a story of one of the experiences that I have had in my life, that I feel like was the most interesting encounters that I have had to this day.

A friend and myself had gone to St. Augustine in Florida, and while there, noticed that the old jail had these paranormal investigations that you could pay to go on at night. Now to start it out, they didn't give too long in there. If I remember correctly you would be allowed to investigate on your own, but after receiving a short introduction and a quick run through of the equipment that they would let you use while there. All together I think we were allowed like 30-45 minutes for the investigation after all the intro and run through with the equipment was done.

But this was my second time doing an investigation, and the whole time they were doing the introductions outside, I could feel some eyes on me from inside the old jail. I remember it was the second floor off to the left side as you look at the Old Jail from outside. Then when we walked inside, we were able to get our hands on some equipment and investigate.

So we started out in the kitchen, and were not really receiving anything there, and proceeded to move over to the cells and see what was out there. Which we didn't really receive anything there, and proceeded to go to the Solitary Confinement Cells. That is where the real stuff kicked off. We didn't capture any EVP's but we did receive spirit orbs (which I had caught on camera) and there was a point when I captured the sounds of feet shuffling on camera.

Now with that, we kept getting spirit orbs every time when we would mention the sheriff, and then we went up to where the sheriff lived when he was over the prison, and caught more spirit orbs as well. When we were checking around in there, I had stepped to the side and received a tug on my shirt, which kind of startled me.

That was one of two investigations that was done in St. Augustine and will be writing the story of the other investigation that we had done, and would love to share that story with you guys as well. Also in regards to the story, if there is interest in seeing the video footage from the old jail, I have those uploaded on my YouTube channel, and can share that link with those that are interested in it.

"Visiting Shaft No. 4, An Old Coal Mine In Hokkaido",Japan,Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: Visiting Shaft No. 4, An Old Coal Mine In Hokkaido

I recently visited an old coal mine near Yubari called Shaft No. 4. It closed many years ago and is now abandoned.

The rusty gate at the entrance was cut open. I took a flashlight and walked inside. The air was cooler and damp, smelling like earth and rust. The tunnel walls were rough stone, and my flashlight only lit a small part ahead.

It was very quiet except for my footsteps. After a while, the air got colder. I could see my breath even though it wasn't cold outside. Then I heard some soft tapping sounds coming from deeper in the tunnel where I couldn't see.

The tapping didn't sound natural. It was like someone walking carefully. I stopped and listened, but the tapping stopped after a few seconds. It felt like something might have been there, just out of sight.

After that, I thought I heard faint whispers, but I couldn't make out any words. It was a quiet sound, and it felt like a warning to leave.

A sudden chill ran through me, and I felt uneasy. When I turned to head back, I saw a shadow move quickly along the wall. I shined my flashlight there, but there was nothing. The darkness seemed deeper than before.

Outside, the sun was setting, but the cold feeling and quietness stayed with me. The usual sounds felt far away.

Even now, I think about that visit. It feels like the miners who worked and died there left a presence behind, a quiet feeling in the cold tunnels.

Visiting abandoned mines can be dangerous. The tunnels may collapse, and the air might be poor. If you go, bring a friend, wear boots and a helmet, carry a flashlight with extra batteries, and tell someone where you're going. Be careful and respect the place and its history.

Yubari was once a busy coal mining town from the early 1900s to the 1960s. Mining was difficult work, and many miners lost their lives underground. When coal demand dropped, the mines closed, and towns like Yubari became empty.

Visiting Shaft No. 4 connects me to that history. It also reminds me that some memories don't fully go away even in dark tunnels.

Encounter Of A Spirit Of A Spider?,Japan,Pets / Animals,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Pets / Animals :: Encounter Of A Spirit Of A Spider?

I had a dream. In it, I was in my hobby room where I keep all my tarantulas. Everything looked exactly the same as in real life, the shelves, the lighting, the soft hum of the air, the subtle warmth. It felt ordinary. But the silence carried a strange weight.

That's when I saw my oldest tarantula. The one who had passed some time ago. She didn't move, but somehow, her thoughts reached into me.

And yet I knew exactly who she meant. The Singaporean Blue. A beautiful spider I had planned to ship out the next morning.

In the dream, I didn't question how I knew, it just made sense. Her message didn't need to be spoken aloud.

I wanted to respond, but I knew I couldn't. Even within the dream, I understood this was a one-way message. I was only meant to receive.

When I woke up, sunlight filled the room. My packaging table was ready, the materials laid out neatly. I was supposed to ship the Singaporean Blue that very day. But the dream lingered.

And there she was. Curled gently around an egg sac. Quietly guarding it, protecting it.

If I had shipped her that day, the eggs might've been lost. She might have been harmed. I cancelled the shipment immediately and called my friend to explain. Thankfully, he understood.

I'm not claiming it was a ghost or something supernatural. But the dream gave me something I had no way of knowing. It changed what I did.

So if something speaks to you in a dream, gives you a message you couldn't have known otherwise, and alters your path, doesn't that make it an encounter? I don't know for sure. But I'm grateful I listened.

Hug Goodbye,Australia,Family / Friends Visits,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Family / Friends Visits :: Hug Goodbye

Y esterday an old friend of the family passed away. V didn't want anyone visiting toward the end, only her immediate family. I wanted so badly to spend more time with her but I respected her wishes.

About a year ago I knew something was wrong with her; it was a gut feeling and nothing more. As the months went by I dreamt about her a lot. In most of these dreams I'm standing on the road outside her house. I know I can't get in and I don't try. They're sad dreams. In one dream I find a path beside one of the front gates. I enter through this path, it leads me to their house. But the house isn't there, it's like it was never built and I can't find my way out again. All dreams are in daylight.

I never asked V if she was okay or if she was ill. A part of me knew not to and another part of me didn't want to know. She's never been the best when it comes to doctors and conversations relating to medical topics always fall flat.

About ten years ago V had another medical scare but came out without a scratch. With little to no medical treatment. She really thought she'd live forever and so did everyone else if we're honest.

Last night I was at home tidying up. While I was dusting a desk I felt V suddenly behind me. It was such a strong feeling and I could see her in my mind stood behind me. I didn't turn around but I said her name and the feeling got stronger still. I could see clearly in my mind how she was standing, what she was wearing, how her hair was styled, everything. In my mind I could see her touching my shoulders in a half hug, way you do when you're comforting someone. When V touched my shoulders there was such an intense unmistakable feeling of her being right there. After a moment I shook the feeling off and walked away because I didn't want this to be what I believed it to be. Wish I hadn't done that.

Last night I kept dreaming of V. Just random stuff like sitting in their kitchen chatting, their dogs being rowdy. One dream was of one of her lampshades which she made for me when I was a wee lass. I have it sitting out ready for an old lamp that needs rewiring.

Today I got the call that she had passed away. I don't know what time it happened, only that it happened yesterday.

While I was on the phone the call kept going into static sounds. At one point the phone beeped a long kind of 'beep' sound. Never heard my phone make that noise. I was talking to my dad, who informed me. The paranormal is a no go topic for him so I didn't bring it up, not sure if he heard anything on his end.

I know it sounds cliché but V's always been an inspiration to me. In that she's always been unapologetically herself. Her passion for antique everything was completely unmatched and her home was the most haunted place I've ever known. I wrote about their ghosties years ago on here. The eccentric couple with the big ole posh place.

V was born into extreme wealth but was a hippy and artist at heart. Never worked a day in her life. Dedicated much of her time to helping others. She was so generous with people, often times to her own detriment. She would often have people in need live with her, usually recovering addicts. Which was often dangerous as V and her husband are big into recreational substances. It usually ended badly, very badly. V was beaten up a few times by some of the people she took in. Her heart was always in the right place but she could be very naive.

I don't think it's completely sunk in yet. I thought writing about last night would make me feel something but I'm kind of just numb.

On a slightly unrelated note about a year ago I was watching a horror on Netflix. In this movie someone holds a duck out from around a doorway or around a corner or something. It's a white duck and someone holds it out so it's like looking at you from the doorway. It's a silly quirky scene but it scared the bejesus out of me. For anyone who may remember, when I wrote about V's place years ago I wrote about a duck puppet that stuck its head around the doorway when we were kids. I thought V's daughter had done this and ran towards the puppet but nothing was there. So, did someone from Netflix read that or what?

The Haunting Of Willows Apartments,"Nebraska, United States",Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: The Haunting Of Willows Apartments

I 'm here to talk about my experiences as a kid in the Willows Apartments. I'm not sure why no one talks about them much, but that place is hell.

When I was just 9-10 years old, I had a very bad experience and very negative. My mom had stayed here when we moved in, I knew something was badly off. I started noticing it when mom would get angry more and easier. I knew being a single parent was bad enough and ever since I was a kid, I'm a magnet for spirits and demonic entities. It's terrifying when you're just a kid.

It started off when moms' emotions would increase, the smallest things could set her off. I could understand why maybe it was stress until... That quickly changed. Started to hear footsteps at night, knockings, slamming kitchen cabinets would wake me up. I thought it was mom, but I would get up and to find her always fast asleep.

One day a childhood friend of mine came to stay the night little did I know that was the last night we stayed there; we encountered evil. My friend and I were in the bedroom playing with toys, when all the sudden I saw a shadow dark run across the wall. I pointed at it and asking her did you see that she looked at me in fear like she saw the whole thing not just a shadow. I screamed for my mom, tears down my face, ""I saw it! I saw a shadow!""

My mom saw my fear and felt it. She contacted her close friend and we cleansed what we could of out apartment and never looked back.

Later that week mom found out that the buildings were built on very bad Indian burial ground, many deaths followed, and the apartments continue to haunt the living to this day.

Unexpected Messages From Loved Ones,"Georgia, United States",Photographs / Videos / EVP,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Photographs / Videos / EVP :: Unexpected Messages From Loved Ones

I t's been a longtime away from the site, just busy but I'm now officially an empty nester and had some extra time to catch up with you all here.

I wanted to document two recent instances of EVPs that just happened unexpectedly, plus something related to the empty nester thing.

First, I was videoing some birds gathering in a tree in my back yard in early spring. They were making a ton of noise eating on the berries and I thought to send the video to my husband at work so walked out to record them. On the way back inside, as it was cold, I yet again didn't tap the off button properly to turn off the video recording (I'm so bad with my phone) so ended up with footage of the birds and the ground as I was walking back inside. But upon playback, as I'm crossing the patio, one can hear a fairly obvious EVP of a voice saying, ""OOH RAH,"" which is what U.S. Marines say... All the dang time. My late husband Scott was a Marine (as is my current husband). If current husband had been in the house, I might conclude the voice was his, but this morning he was already AT WORK. I can't imagine any of my elderly neighbors hollering like a Marine, so I'm left thinking it was Scott, yet again finding a way to be heard on a random day. He died from brain cancer in 1993 at age 32.

Then, last week, went to visit family graves at the cemetery where my aunt was recently interred. Scott's plot is just across the small interior street from my mom's. You can stand at mom's grave and see his and vice versa. Anyway, I decided to record as I walked up, because last time I was there I got an EVP. This visit, a woman's voice on video says, ""It's a woman"" as I'm walking to the gravesite. I stand there a minute and look over to Scott's grave and pretty sure there was a tear falling as I walked back down a slight hill to my car. The same woman's voice says, ""It's ok"" on my video recording. Easily heard, much appreciated.

Finally, Mom had given me a silver bracelet at the time of her diagnoses with cancer in 2013. I'm not much for jewelry, but I wore this bracelet every day. Sometime at the beginning of the covid lockdown, I lost it. Obviously not going anywhere, but it just sort of disappeared and over the last four years I've looked everywhere and yes, it did cross my mind that it was significantly from my mom.

Well, I have four kids and the last of them graduated from high school this spring. I've been raising kids 36 years and am 64 now, so it's going to be great as these last two finish college and join their siblings in adulthood. We had a large graduation party and that day I went into the closet where Mom's china (she left me) is kept to get a platter. I had to move a silver gravy boat out of the way to get to it and guess what just happened to be in the gravy boat? Right -- Mom's silver bracelet! Found on the day of the last kid's graduation, an occasion I know Mom would've loved. There is NO reason for that bracelet to have been there these last four years! I can't help but think it was yet another message from Mom.

The Cry In The Tunnel,China,Ghost Tours & Haunted Hotels,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Ghost Tours & Haunted Hotels :: The Cry In The Tunnel

A few years ago, I visited Harbin during the coldest part of winter.

The city was covered in deep snow, and the air was sharp and dry.

Walking through the streets, everything felt quiet and still - a kind of stillness that comes with extreme cold.

I had come as a tourist, interested in both the city's architecture and its history.

One site in particular stood out on the map: the Unit 731 Museum.

Unit 731 was a former covert military facility operated by the Imperial Japanese Army during World War II.

It served as a research base for biological warfare. Inside, human experiments were conducted (studies on frostbite, intentional infection with disease, and live vivisections.)

Thousands of people, many of them civilians and prisoners of war, died as a result.

The lighting is dim, and many areas of the building have been left in their original condition.

The displays include photos, documents, and preserved medical tools.

At one point, a guide pointed to a stairway leading underground and said,

""That tunnel leads to the prisoner cells. You may go down alone if you'd like.""

The tunnel was narrow, the walls damp. The air was colder than above.

Water dripped steadily from the ceiling, and the passage echoed faintly with each step.

Continuing forward, I heard another sound... Faint, possibly a voice.

It resembled a quiet whisper, unclear""Ahma."" (probably mother in Chinese)

Then I heard what sounded like a slow exhale close to my ear.

Back in the main building, I told a staff about what I had experienced.

She said, ""Many people hear things in that tunnel. Some things stay, even when they're gone.""

Though I don't claim to understand what I heard or felt, the visit to Unit 731 left an impression, not through horror or theatrics, but through the weight of documented history and preserved space.

It is a reminder of what human beings are capable of and why some places should be preserved, not forgotten.

The 3 A.m. Sleep Paralysis And Vivid Dreams,India,Old Hags / Night Attacks / Sleep Paralysis,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Old Hags / Night Attacks / Sleep Paralysis :: The 3 A.m. Sleep Paralysis And Vivid Dreams

The story is of my best friend. Let's call him Kapil. I am an eye witness of this.

This all happened during the lockdown in 2021. Kapil, my best friend, had been telling me about these really vivid and scary dreams he was having, always between 2 and 3 AM. He also mentioned experiencing sleep paralysis.

One day, with our exams approaching, I went over to his place for a night study session. It got pretty late, and around 1 AM, we decided to call it a night and get some sleep. We were sleeping in the same room, but our beds were on opposite walls.

Around 3 AM, I was jolted awake by a faint rustling sound. I sat up in my bed, and when my eyes landed on Kapil, a chill shot down my spine. He was thrashing, desperately trying to move, but couldn't, and his eyes were wide open. I immediately knew it was sleep paralysis.

Without thinking, I grabbed my water bottle and sprinkled a few drops on his face. It worked! He snapped out of it. But just as he did, we both heard it - the distinct sound of a plate dropping in the kitchen.

We were both instantly terrified. Neither of us dared to go check it out. Then, to our horror, the same sound came again. We just stayed frozen in our beds, listening.

After a few tense moments, we both started to relax a bit. I asked Kapil what had happened to him. He whispered that a ""totally black shadow"" had come and sat on his chest. He said he tried desperately to scream or even move his hands, but he couldn't. It was a truly terrible night for us.

After that night, I never tried to sleep at his home again. Kapil later told me that he continued to experience such incidents. Now he's in the UK, so I don't talk to him as much about it, but that night is something I'll never forget.

A Bizarre Encounter At The Olde Angel Inn,Canada,Ghost Tours & Haunted Hotels,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Ghost Tours & Haunted Hotels :: A Bizarre Encounter At The Olde Angel Inn

A t the early morning hours of May 25th, 1813, American military forces had launched a third invasion attempt against Canada. After U.S. Naval vessels had arrived along the shores of the Niagara River, a relentless two-day assault commenced against the British defense stronghold of Fort George. Despite valiant efforts to defend the fort, the Redcoat defenders were soon overwhelmed by the invading forces and had no other option than to abandon the fort. The Americans soon stormed into the adjacent town of Newark (modern day Niagara on the Lake) with the intentions of burning it to the ground. The siege ultimately led to a local tavern known as the Harmonious Coach House, where a British officer named Captain Colin Swayze would meet his tragic demise.

In order to flush out any enemy troops hiding within the tavern's basement, American soldiers took their bayonets and began systematically impaling the wooden wine barrels as well as any other objects capable of concealing any potential hiders. After being spotted within the confines of an empty barrel, Captain Colin Swayze was promptly stabbed and succumbed to his injuries almost immediately. (Mysteries of Canada, 2024)

Eventually, the Harmonious Coach House was renamed the Olde Angel Inn. Due to the utter brutality of Captain Swayze's death, it comes as no surprise that his restless spirit continues to linger aimlessly throughout the inn. Nestled within the heart of Niagara on the Lake, the Olde Angel Inn remains a popular destination for those intrigued by the many alleged hauntings reported over the span of several years. Being highly publicized in multiple paranormal reality shows, it becomes rather easy to understand why the inn receives such high amounts of revenue in tourism on an annual basis.

My first and only trip to the Olde Angel Inn happened back in August of 2006. I was accompanied by my mother, as well as my sister and brother. We had been informed of an apparent incident that occurred at the inn years prior to our arrival, which fueled our interests to visit. It was said that the incident involved a young American woman visiting the town with a group of her friends and decided to spend the night at the renowned hotel. She apparently wore a T-shirt depicting the image of a waving American flag. After exiting her room and nonchalantly traversing the hall, she abruptly stopped in her tracks, as she claimed to have felt the intense sensation of being slapped across the face. Though there was no definite proof to explain the encounter, it could be surmised that the vindictive Captain Swayze still continues to express his distain for those who happen to share the same nationality as the lone individual responsible for his departure.

We had finally arrived at the inn in the late afternoon. Though we were all mildly nervous, we were still highly excited and decided to help ease the tension by making jokes about the encounters reported by former guests. After an evening of bike riding, followed by an extended tour of Fort George, we decided to head back to the inn and go to sleep. For the first couple of hours, I struggled to fall asleep. Once I had begun to gradually calm myself down, I began to drift off and abruptly awoke, feeling as if someone had forcibly grabbed my shoulders. I was perfectly aware that I was the only one fully awake, as the others were peacefully sleeping in the adjacent bedroom. Despite the bewildering experience, I soon managed to fall asleep and woke up the following morning feeling well rested. The hotel had even given us a certificate to confirm our stay at the inn. As a humorous gesture, my mother decided to hang the certificate on our refrigerator. In spite of the strange experience, I still hope to one day return to the Olde Angel Inn and perhaps share even more personal stories.

Lady in White,Canada,Old Hags / Night Attacks / Sleep Paralysis,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Old Hags / Night Attacks / Sleep Paralysis :: Lady in White

I don't really know if this is a ""ghost story"" or not.  I had a very terrible experience last night and it scared me out of my wits.

My boyfriend and I had a late night last night.  It was approximately 3:00am when we decided to go to sleep.  His daughter had gone to sleep already after watching a movie with us (nothing scary or disturbing).  I slept in my room and he retired to his.  She sleeps in the bedroom between ours.  I seemed to have some trouble falling asleep and was in and out until I got up around 4:30am to use the bathroom.  I went back to bed and I believe I fell back asleep.  Now, I don't really remember anything up until I woke up.  What I believe I remember is being unable to make any sound... I tried to speak or cry... and really having to force it out.  Before I woke up I thought I heard voices and maybe someone being in my room.  I also thought that my boyfriend's daughter had stepped into my room asking me if I was ok.  It wasn't her though.  It was a woman dressed in a white gown and had a luminous glow around her that seemed to be coming from the door of my room. (the door was open) She had her arms outstreched to me and I think she was asking me to go with her.  This is when I saw my boyfriend at the door of my room. He told me afterwards he was awoken by what he thought was a child crying/wailing and thought it was his daughter.  He checked on her but she was fast asleep.  I sat up in bed and had to catch my breath because my heart was racing and I had a great fear about me.  My whole body was tense and I felt nauseous because of the nerves in my stomach.  I was afraid to go back to bed.  My boyfriend sat up with me for a while but my guilt got the best of me and I went back to bed so he could sleep too.  I had to take half a mild sedative (which I never do) so I could fall asleep again.  No more occurrences happened after that.

Now, I do have to mention some strange things that occurred in and around the same time.  Before I went to sleep the first time I thought I had seen about 2 or 3 times some shadows appear out of the corner of my eyes.  Nothing was there of course and I just figured it was because I was growing tired.  Also, around the time I got up to go to the bathroom, my boyfriend said he heard me and said he saw a shadow look into his room after I turned the light off.  He assumed it was me but I didn't go by his room at all.  When I went to bed the first time I thought I heard voices and saw dim lights about my door (other than the nightlight out in the hallway).  I assumed it was my boyfriend, being unable to sleep, going back to watch television.  He said he did not get up again at all... he had fallen asleep right away.  And also, when my boyfriend had gotten up to check on his daughter, while he was at her bedroom door he said he had heard someone say in a gravelly low voice ""over here Frank"".  He thought it was me but it wasn't.  I thought I heard him speak to me asking me if I was ok but he also said he hadn't spoken.  He also told me that he had 3 bad dreams involving the ""hag lady"" right after I finally went to sleep again.  He had this dream before a few years back but it hadn't happened in quite a while.

I don't know what all this means.  I don't normally have bad dreams and I don't really remember much of any of my dreams.  I haven't experienced any supernatural events that I can recall either.  All I know is that everything felt so real... like I wasn't really sleeping.

Am I overreacting because I'm kind of freaked out and I think I've unintentionally freaked my boyfriend and his daughter out too.  Any feedback would be greatly appreciated.

Touched,"New Jersey, United States",Old Hags / Night Attacks / Sleep Paralysis,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Old Hags / Night Attacks / Sleep Paralysis :: Touched

I just recently read a story about sleep paralysis on this site and remembered a story that happened to me very recently. I've never experienced sleep paralysis, but I completely understood what it is and what happens to a person when it occurs, so when it happened, I wasn't as frightened as some might be without previous knowledge.

I did my usual meditation before going to sleep, because it kills time and helps out with my sleep, and at one point in the night I awoke. Now, I normally wake up about 4-5 times a night in need of water or some drink. I don't know why, but it's been happening for years now. It doesn't bother me too much, because I have a drink by my bed for this reason alone. This one night, I woke up and didn't feel thirsty, and in fact, didn't feel anything at all. I quickly realized I couldn't move any body part at all. I remember feeling so much energy inside me trying to push out. Then I felt something touch my ankle. It was extremely noticeable because I couldn't feel any body part at all. But I felt something cold poke my ankle like a finger or something. Needless to say, I used every force of energy I had and pushed my arm forward and was completely rejuvenated. The whole ordeal lasted only about 12 seconds which is very short from what I've heard about past sleep paralysis experiences. I think this could be attributed to my meditation and knowledge of not panicking when feeling this strange sleep condition.

After experiencing this, I will say that it is truly a frightening thing to have happen to me. Feel free to leave any comments on what you think.

Diana,Philippines,Family / Friends Visits,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Family / Friends Visits :: Diana

I was packing my things when my room mate Diana went in. We are studying on different school but we are room mates for 3 years. She was jolly and nice. But that afternoon she looked sad. I asked her what was wrong with her but she assured me she's ok. She's just tired so I didn't bother her. She lies on her bed and close her eyes. When I finished doing my things I bid her goodbye. She rose, hugged me and told me to take care. I smiled at her and told her to give me a call if she needs someone to talk to.

I am going home for the weekends, as my daily routine for 3 years. I was thinking of Diana on my way home. As I reached home I decided to call her but I cannot reach her. I started to get worried. I told my mom about it and she told me maybe she was sleeping and her phone got low bat. I dismiss the thoughts that are coming in my mind, I am not feeling good on whatever is happening on her. Around 9: 15 pm after our dinner I received a call from her. I told her I was worried about her and it's a good thing she called.

""Stop worrying cat, I'm ok. I just want to tell, you you're so nice and I'll miss you.""

""What are talking about? I will be back on Sunday afternoon, you never miss me during weekends!"" This sounded weird now and my hands got cold! ""Are you not going home?"" I asked her.

""No. Look Cat I need to go now, goodnight. Just send my regards to your mom""

""Ok, I'll just tell her. Bye"" she cut the line and my heart was still pounding fast. I told my mom Diana is ok, she just called me and she sends you her regards. After few minutes my cell phone rang, it was our land lady. She was crying and freaking out. I cannot understand what she is saying. I told her to calm down and tell me what happened.

She told me that at around 8:45 pm they heard a noise from our room, so she decided to come. She knocked and called Diana because she knows I already left that afternoon, but there are no response, so she opened the door. She almost got a heart attack when she saw Diana hanging on the ceiling! She then called other borders and asked for help but when they got Diana down, she was no longer breathing. They tried to revive her while the ambulance was on its way but she was dead already!

I was speechless! She just called me few minutes ago! It can't be! The hair on my nape rose! My bloods run cold! I don't know what to say.

""We already called her parents, they are on their way to pick-up her body.""

We ended the call and I told my mother what happened. She also cannot believe what happened.

The following day we went to Diana's place for the funeral. I still can't believe everything happened just like that. I told her mom our last talk, she cried and told me she also received a call from Diana but that was before she did it.

Until now, I cannot believe what happened. I am just praying that wherever she is, she's just ok. Liked what she told me.

Great Grandmother,"Florida, United States",Family / Friends Visits,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Family / Friends Visits :: Great Grandmother

I was in my bedroom ""studying"" when I accidentally fell asleep. I awoke 2 and a half hours later to see my Great Grandmother standing in front of me. The problem was... She died 2 weeks earlier. I asked her what she was doing here, she told me that she had to tell me something... but she could not tell me what it was. I had to guess. The first thing that came to my mind was, someone is going to die. So I asked, ""is someone going to die?"" she said yes. I said is it me? she said no, you have a while. I asked is it my mom? she said no. then I asked her if it was my grandpa, she said yes. I asked how long... all she would say was ""new year"".  Now I think she is hanging out in my house, turning on lights, slamming the bathroom door, and I am hoping she will talk to me soon.

Slumber Party Gone Wrong,Australia,Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: Slumber Party Gone Wrong

M y friend was having a slumber party for her birthday and she invited me. It was me, Anna, Jodie and Alise. We were mucking around, telling scary stories, making some up and real ones that we experiencd. Just at thw time when jodie told hers, there was a big bang at the door. We were all scared because Alise's mom and dad had gone out that night, so we were home alone. We decided to lock all doors and windows and then we met back at the room we slept in. Jodie didn't come back, and when we got back, the window in that room was open. We assumed Jodie went out there to try and scare us, but thinking back, Jodie is the most scared of us all. We were scared.

We checked out the window and no one was out there, so we locked it. We checked the whole house downstairs, then checked up, and we heard screaching. We went in the room we thought it was coming from and there was Jodie trying to shut a window that screached when it grinded along the bottom. Then as we all tried to shut it, it just shut. Like that. No screaching. It was as if someone or something was holding it shut. Then the bang at the door again. 5 times. We decided to check it out. As we went down stairs, they all voted me to open it. So I did. Nothing.

Then, as I shut it, something held it and something said: ""let me free"". We didn't understand it. What does this mean? We decided to let it go. Besides, we were kids, what were we going to do? No one would believe us. From that night on, we dreamt about it but when we tried to talk about it, we just couldn't. It was strange.

Pinch,United Kingdom,Apparitions / Voices / Touches,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Apparitions / Voices / Touches :: Pinch

M y name is Alinah-Jo, and I never believed in ghosts until one day at school, me and my friends were talking about their ghostly experiences. I didn't believe in ghosts and I was getting tired of hearing things I didn't think were true, so I went to the bathroom. I heard a little girl sniffing. I asked if she was ok but no one answered, which I thought was strange. That night, I went on my computer to check out the ghost web sites and as I was reading some disturbing ghost stories, someone or something pinched me on the arm. I thought it was my little brother and I looked, but no one was there. I kept on reading, a little bit scared. Then something or someone, as I said, leaned over me and I felt a small gust of wind, small enough to be someone breathing. I thought it couldn't have been a ghost because they don't breathe.

I was shaking and then the door slammed, but it was my older sister and I quickly jumped off the computer. She noticed me shaking and asked what was wrong. I told her everything that happened today. She told me not to worry because she was there with me. She told me to try and think of something happy, but every time I got something happy in my head, it just turned to what had just happened. Now, after what had happened that day, I believe in ghosts and choose not to talk about what had happened when we talk about ghost things at school. But I still can't understand what that sobbing was in the toilets that day.

Please tell it may have just been a kid in the toilets. I saw every door was open as I went out.

Violent Ghost,Australia,Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: Violent Ghost

O ne night, I was watching TV in my room when I felt like something was watching me. In the corner of my eye, I thought I saw a shadow move. When I looked over to the corner of my room, I saw it was where my bookcase was and thought it was just my imagination. I turned the TV off and reached for the light switch so I could go to bed.

There are 2 mirrors in my room on opposing walls and one of them is very large. When I reached for the switch I saw a shadow distinctly move in the larger mirror. When I quickly jerked my head to where the shadow might have been, I noticed the bookcase had a weird sort of dark hazy shadow to the side of it. It wasn't very noticeable and if I hadn't of seen something move near there, I probably wouldn't have seen it. I kept focusing when it moved! At that same time I got the worst headache and had to grab my head, it hurt so much! I closed my eyes and when I opened them and looked at the bookcase, the ghost wasn't there.

I looked around my room until I finally saw it. It had moved closer to me and was becoming more noticeable. The hazy darkness had gotten darker and I could start to see the shape of a slightly bulky man. I kept my eyes on it and it stayed put. My head was thumping but I didn't want to take my eyes off it. Then it shrank suddenly, to the floor. I didn't want to look down in case something sudden happened, so I stayed put.

I waited for about 1 1/2 hours until I thought it was gone and went to turn off the light. I felt something grab my arm though and pull at it. In my head, I suddenly thought of the words; 'back moment', for no reason. I looked at the shadow and closed my eyes thinking it would go away. It did but when I looked around the room again I saw it back near the bookcase again. This time, I told it to go away and leave me alone and it quickly moved across the room near the door. There was a bottle of perfume on the mini table near the door and the shadow knocked it off when it moved. I turned off the light and got under the covers and it felt like the covers were squeezing me. Like when you suck air out of a bag with something in it. I tried to move but it felt like I was stuck and I heard something like an animal dying. My bed started shaking and I fought to get free of my blanket. I managed to stick my head out and saw the shadow figure standing across the room just watching me. I could see its eyes because they were more black then the rest of it. The bed was still shaking and the covers were still tight so I closed my eyes and screamed. Then my bed stopped, the blankets became loose and I ran out, in my PJ's, got in my car and stayed at a friend's house after telling her what happened.

I asked one of my more religious friend's to find someone to exorcise my flat but I haven't had any word back yet. This happened about a month ago and I've been at my house during the day but at my friend's house in the night time. I can't bear to sleep in my room anymore after what happened.

Pinned Down,"California, United States",Old Hags / Night Attacks / Sleep Paralysis,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Old Hags / Night Attacks / Sleep Paralysis :: Pinned Down

A bout 3 years ago, around the beginning of january, I had a very unusual experience in my room. I was around 16 years old, and I had just finished talking on the phone. It was around 11:30 at night and I wasn't sleepy. Since my parents would have gotten mad that I was up so late at night, I didn't want to turn on the light to entertain myself, so I had a little candle lit and started drawing on my notepad for about another 15 minutes or so. Then I just blew out the candle, laid on my back wide awake staring at the ceiling.

A few seconds later, I started hearing a ticking in my room. Like a clock or something, but the thing was I didn't have a clock in my room and we didn't even have a clock in the house that would tick. So I thought it was my dog playing with something, but then I remembered she doesn't sleep in my room and my door was closed so she couldn't have wandered into my room or anything. So I just tried to ignore it. But it kept hearing the ticking. It was two ticks then a few seconds pause, then two ticks, and a few seconds pause. A few minutes later, instead of the pauses I heard a creek in the floor. I thought it was my dog again, but no, my door was closed so she couldn't be in my room. It sounded like someone took a step at the foot of my bed. I heard two ticks, then two creeks, two steps, and two creeks. So I started getting a little nervous. I sat up to see if I saw anything, but I saw nothing in my room. It was kind of hard to see because my room was dark. I layed down, covered my face and yelled for my mom. As soon as I yelled, the ticks and creeks got faster and faster and all of a sudden I felt something jump on top of me as if they were trying to pin me down. I started screaming! I started kicking and punching whatever was on top of me to try and get it off, but no luck, whatever it was, was pinning me to my bed and I couldn't get up. So started screaming louder and louder and of course the ticks and creeks got faster and louder, and it felt like forever for my parents to come into my room!

Finally I heard footsteps running to my room and my parents opened the door, turned on the lights and EVERYTHING stops. The ticking stops, the creeks stops, and whatever was on top of me just vanished off me. I was left hysterically crying and shaking, wondering what happened. Until this day, I still have no clue what it was.

I was wondering, I actually was raised catholic and to believe in God and have faith, but recently that week I lost all faith in God, stopped believing, and stop praying. About three or four days later, this happens. I was wondering what ""attacked"" me and if it had anything to do with me not believing in god for that short time?

A Haunted House,"West Virginia, United States",Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: A Haunted House

W e live in my house for about 15 years and we had things happen to us. I was taking a bath with the bathroom door opened and I looked in the hall way and I saw a dark shadow. At night my TV changes channels and turns on be itself! I have things move in the house. One day my friend saw a boy walk in my house, she came over to see who it was and she saw a picture hanging on my wall. She said it was him and we asked ""what about him"", she says he walked in our doorway! We told her that he died a long time ago.

I was sitting downstairs and I had my hairbrush on the coffee table and it fell down on the floor! I decided to leave it on the floor. I would not stay downstairs by myself because I feel there is something watching me. The other day I was cleaning my room, and in the corner of my eye, I saw a shadow of a lady. When I looked back again it was gone. I had so many people say they would not stay in my house! I have 3 birds and at night they go crazy like they see things.  I keep hearing people talking and yelling my name. One day I was setting downstairs and I saw a kind of smoke, it went to the stairs and it was gone! Before my brother moved out, he says he was laying on the bed and he saw an old fashioned dressed boy shadow looking at him.

Haunted Hotel,"Michigan, United States",Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: Haunted Hotel

H i, I am Amber from Michigan.  I had plenty of experiences with ghosts. Let me tell you the weirdest one. When I was 10, I was going to a hotel. I was allowed to bring 2 friends. I brought Lydia and Amanda. The hotel was known to be haunted by a beautiful lady. She was staying at the hotel. She was lonely and sick and she ended up taking her own life. She is known to now haunt the hotel. We ended up getting the room she killed herself in. Lydia, Amanda and I were freaked. When my friend got up, she heard footsteps. She slept on the floor. Lydia and I got to share a bed. My mom got her own bed. The next day, when I was in the bathroom, taking a shower, I heard a lady say ""kill me"". That night, my mom locked us in the room and went gambling. We kept hearing footsteps. We were so scared, we went to bed. Someone pulled the blankets off me and Lydia. We saw that Amanda was sleeping. I saw the outline of a lady. In the morning, we fixed our bed and my mom was still sleeping. We saw a lady lying on the bed. We tried to pull off the sheet, but the ghost was lying on it. We had to fix our beds because it would cost more to have a maid. When my mom woke up, she told us she saw a white beautiful lady going in the next door room. She noticed she was looking at a ghost. We left that day. At school, we told all the kids about our experience.

Thanks for listening to my experiences. Comments are welcome.

The Sick Man,"Colorado, United States",Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: The Sick Man

H ello, I'm ©Œnter¢o®€. This happened to me way back in eighth grade (I'm about to graduate now). One might classify this as sleep paralysis, or a dream, or hallucination, or whatever. But it certainly was much more.

I was lying on the couch in my family room one day. It was a calm day, no storms, no rain, just sunny weather, and my TV was on. The volume wasn't too high; I was sort of trying to fall asleep at the time. But anyway, I found myself unable to move suddenly. I knew I'd briefly fallen asleep. I tried to get up, but not only did I feel bound to the couch, but I also felt a weird sensation that something was watching me. I know it sounds weird to say, it didn't FEEL like a hallucination, but it didn't. I truly had that odd feeling of another presence nearby, and I was the only one home.

As I laid there, it didn't take long before I heard a weird coughing in the living room (I was in the family room). I could move my eyes, and definitely open them somewhat widely, as far as sleep paralysis goes. I started to notice a shadow making its way along the linoleum floor, creeping its way to the beginning of the carpet of the family room. The light over the dining table was on, as was the kitchen light, where the shadow was casting away from. Before anything else could happen, I was fully awoken as the phone rang. I shot up off the couch, rubbed my eyes, and ran to the phone, not thinking about what had just happened.

As soon as I got to the phone I noticed something odd about the caller i.d. It displayed an odd number I knew it couldn't be a phone number. But I picked it up, and put the receiver to my ear. ""Hello?"" I muttered. I heard a weird static, like the kind you hear when the person on the other end isn't saying anything and it's just that static buzzing. ""Hello?!"" I called again. This time, I heard a voice breathe in, about to speak. ""Your day will get weird."" I heard a raspy, scooby doo-villain type voice say. Then a weird clicking sound, almost like they had hung up. I heard two more clicks, and as I was about to hang up, ""Now it becomes weirder...""

I was too puzzled to speak, so I listened for a moment longer. I heard more rustling like the caller was messing with the phone cord or something. Then, more quickly than the previous line, He/She/It said ""Now it gets entirely bizarre..."" And then I heard more rustling, and then another voice join it, and they both sort of groaned, and then one (the more 'normal' one) said ""That's about how he said it in the movie, right?"" Then, ""Quite so.""

Then, almost immediately, the only sound was the dial tone. I slowly set down the phone and looked around a little bit. Just a dream, right? Well, I wasn't sure. You know when you're awake and when you're dreaming. In a dream, you can't fully comprehend the world around you. Strange and unexplainable things happen. In real life, when you're awake, you just know it. I was not dreaming. But then I checked the caller i.d., and gasped. That call hadn't been recorded in the caller history thing.

I heard yet another weird sound upstairs. It was that same coughing I'd heard previously. It sounded sick, as though whoever it was was about to vomit. I gained a little bit of courage and made my way to the stairs in the big living room. My mom was at work, and my dad lived in Denver (we lived in Castle Rock, CO). Obviously though, I was not alone. It felt like forever before I got to the top of the stairs and looked around for whatever it could have been that made the coughing sounds I'd heard. It would have made sense to guess that someone was playing a prank on me, but I had no friends back then (or enemies), so this baffled me. I detected no sign of intrusion anywhere in the house. All the doors and windows were locked, no broken glass was anywhere, and the basement door was always closed and locked.

I briefly looked in my mom's room, and after I concluded it was empty, I crossed the small hallway into the laundry room. It was barely big enough for one person, and quite dark. No way anyone was in there. The only option left was to search my room, and the guest room, which sat on either side of the laundry room, and were both connected by a long bathroom. I heard two feet shifting somewhere. I thought against going into the guest room, as in my childhood I'd always felt an odd presence in that room (that's another story). But then I wondered if that same presence had materialized as a ghost. I immediately scolded myself for such an outlandish thought. But then it almost seemed like something - some voice, or force, was answering my thoughts. I crept into the guest room and searched around. I didn't feel as strong of a presence now as I always had, but it was definitely there.

The room was as it had always been - the made bed, not used for over six years, the dusty bookshelf littered with remnants of the good old days, and a small blue shelf with a lamp. Then I looked to the bathroom door. Now, until then, I'd always thought I'd heard strange sounds coming from the guest room and the bathroom anytime I'd be near it. However, my mom never said anything about it. I may never know if she HAD heard these things or not, but I know I did. The guest room had once been my sister's when she lived with us. After she moved out I always sensed that weird presence in there. Now, as I crept for the bathroom door, I got a weird chill that ran through my body. Not one of excitement, but of a sudden and unexplainable fear.

I drew nearer and nearer, until my teeth were almost chattering. I had never felt like this before. The house was like 50° that day, and it was summer. I'd been uncomfortably warm all day, and all week. I slammed my eyes shut, swallowed, opened my eyes again, and looked into the bathroom, to find... Nothing unusual. The light shone in from the small rectangular window, the bathtub shined, the sink on the other end of the room was calm (sometimes it dripped for no reason), and overall the weird sensation seemed to go away. What was that all about!? Wait a second, something was odd.... First I went to the mirror to make sure nothing was weird about me. Nope, nothing weird at all. I just stared at my reflection for a moment, then turned, as a weird sound emanated from the tub.

The sound of a small piece of something hitting the tub floor caught my attention. Then two more. Then the sound of a bigger piece clattered to the floor. Then three more mid-sized ones. I turned and peered around the side of the half-wall that separated the two sides of the room. What the hell? The tile wall was crumbling away. A big chunk of the wall was gone, right toward the corner. Soon, a piece fell away, revealing a small hole. Then more around it fell off, increasing the size of the hole. I stepped back, prepared to defend myself. But a few minutes passed, and the crumbling ceased. When all seemed calm enough, I slowly took a step toward the tub.

I stepped into the tub and kept my gaze on the hole, afraid to look away in case it was a hallucination and would disappear. I blinked. It was still there. I reached up to touch the edges, and it was definitely not my eyes playing tricks on me. I peered inside the pitch black hole, and suddenly I watched as a pale white arm swept across the hole from the other side. It was like someone was standing on the left side of the hole, against the wall, and had scratched their cheek or something, and that was their arm lowering back to their side. That's the best way to put it. Afraid to look inside any closer, I backed up. I heard the person right there breathe out, and instead of running, I angrily said, ""What do you want?"" But nobody answered. In fact, that weird feeling that I was accompanied by a presence suddenly lifted. I moved up to the hole and prepared to stick my head in and look around. But pain shot through my head as it hit solid wall. I shut my eyes in pain and rubbed the spot, then looked up. The hole was gone.

Tormented in Brooklyn,"New York, United States",Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: Tormented in Brooklyn

I wrote about this briefly in a prior article in 2001. To recap: we moved into 455a sackett street when I was 14 years old, on april 1, 1998. from the moment we moved in, something was so not right. It was an incredibly dark apartment... though we should have been thrilled because it was the first apartment we'd ever had with more than one floor. There were three floors (including the basement) and it was nice, if you could ignore the feeling of someone standing just behind you, or staring at you wherever you went.

Within two weeks of moving in, I was raped in my own bedroom by a man from the neighborhood. An elderly woman who'd lived right next store for most of our life informed us that no one had occupied our apartment for more than a year at a time since as long as she could remember... she also related that terrible tragedies befell all of said people, within only a few weeks of moving in, continuing through the day they moved out.

Though we all had eerie feelings in the apartment, we'd not noticed anything too weird. The apartment was very uninviting, cold and damp. We tried to decorate it, warm it up a little, but nothing helped. Another thing was that no matter what we did, we could not get a phone installed. we had the phone company over about 4 times to fix the wires, but no matter what they did, we would get absolutely nothing, not even static. so we were pretty isolated.

The entire time we were there, weird happenings continued. The ceiling above my brothers bed collapsed. The only reason he wasn't hurt is because he got up to use the bathroom. A fire started in my room, the fire department never determined why. If my friend hadn't stopped by and rang my bell, I would of continued sleeping. Within 5 minutes of answering the bell, my neighbor came out screaming that my room was on fire. I ran up and the entire back wall was in flames. I tried to put it out with a blanket and (unbeknownst to me) the door had closed behind me. It went from daylight to dark in two minutes and I started to pass out. Thankfully, my friend ran up and opened the door, carrying me down the stairs or I would have been literal toast.

After that, my neighbor confided in us that ""strange things"" have always gone on in my building. In the 30's or 40's, a fire had killed a little boy within a month of the family moving in, in the 60's, a couple were ""whacked"" by the mob because of some insidious affair. There were no records because the church's records had been burned in a fire so we couldn't get anymore information than what people said.

There were other things that happened, a friend of mine coming into my apartment and seeing a little boy in burnt rags staring at her in my bathroom mirror.. she ran out crying and refused to set foot in my door again. Another friend who slept over (note: both friends were not told of our experiences) and awoke in the middle of the night swearing that she saw a woman walk into my room through the door.

My brother and I heard children crying and laughing one day downstairs, and when we tried to leave my mother's room, we were locked in, event though there was no lock, for an hour before it finally opened. My mother was downstairs doing the laundry when the lights turned off in the basement and she felt a cold, scaly hand grab her shoulder. Needless to say, my dad did the laundry after that... weird smells, sounds, and the feeling that something, or someone, did not want you there. That something bad was going to happen to you, and that you were not welcome at all.

We moved out a year to the day later, as soon as we could find a new apartment. We found out some more after that. The people that moved in after us tried to renovate the basement, and found the body of a little boy in the wall. They left suddenly one night not too long after and never returned. Another couple moved in and left as inexplicably as the last. And so on and so forth to this day.

Since then, we met a woman whom had gone to my mother's office (she's a nurse that works in a doctors office) because of a nervous condition. My mother noticed the address on her insurance card didn't match the one listed, and the woman explained she had only lived at 55a sackett street for a few months, and had to leave because her mother had died along with various other tragedies from the 1st week of moving in. My mother asked if the woman ever noticed anything weird... well, the woman explained exactly what we had gone through, perhaps the cause of her condition?

We are all fine now, happy to be out of there and we've moved on. We still see our old neighbor once in a while, and she always says the best thing we ever did was move out of that god forsaken house. Needless to say, we agree. We've not been haunted since, and life is good. If there is one thing we learned, I'd say it was to trust our instincts. If you get horrible vibes from a place, don't put it off as folly... it might just save you a whole lot of trouble.

Home Alone on a Freaky Friday,"Michigan, United States",Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: Home Alone on a Freaky Friday

H i, some of you may of read my other story Haunted Hotel ,  well here is one of my other experiences. On one stormy friday night, at about 8:30 pm, when I was about 16, my mom and dad had to work over time and my sister was sleeping at a friend's house. My brother was at my cousin's house. I was home alone. I had some ghost experiences in this house before, but this one is the scariest. I was in the living room, watching a TV show, and the sink went on and it sounded like someone was doing the dishes. I looked over in the kitchen and all the dishes were still there dirty. I thought I was hearing things so I went to my room to sleep. It felt like someone was watching me. I kept hearing little creeks, like my door was opening. I looked and no one was there. I looked in the mirror and saw an outline of a little boy. My old baby teddy bear that I found in the house, when I moved in, flew up in the air. He said ""I want my dolly"". He sounded angry. I ran to my kitchen, got the phone and called my mom's cell phone. No one answered. I was totally freaked out. I ran to my room under my bed. When my mom came home, she looked under my bed and was surprised to see me. I told her ""mom, my my my old teddy flew in the the air... I saw a a a ghost"". She took me to the doctors. She thought I was crazy. The doctor said ""she is not crazy, now the best thing for you to do is to bless the house"". We got a person to come and bless the house. Some things still happen. I don't think blessing the house was enough.

Angry Spirits,"Kansas, United States",Misc,"M e, my friend, and my boyfriend were driving around one night and randomly decided that we wanted to visit a graveyard because we are really into ghosts. I kind of have a keen sense for ghosts and when we got there I didn't quite feel right, so when they got out of my car I stayed in. My friend came running back to my car saying she saw something a ways away. They jumped back in my car and we drove the direction my friend pointed. We got near the tombstone and I started shaking really bad, and me and my friend saw this black figure by the tombstone. I started shaking more, feeling like the figure wanted to hurt me, I could feel so many waves of hate and pain I started crying. My friend and boyfriend wanted to stay (my boyfriend did because somehow, he didn't see anything) but I had to get out of there because I just didn't feel safe. It took me an hour to stop shaking after we got back to my house. I hadn't seen a ghost in years so it was really scary for me, especially since it was a ghost with a grudge of some kind.

I've only had one other experience with an ""angry spirit"" and it was when I was 9 or 10 years old. Me and an old friend of mine were looking for stuff to use to decorate a club we had in this tree line. We came across a pile of cement slabs and we found some rusted cans and stuff near by and in the rocks. She wandered off but I saw this can in this hole in the pile of rocks. There was no way anything bigger then the can could be in there, but when I reached my hand in a black, charred hand grabbed my wrist. My wrist felt like it was on fire, like it was going to burn off and I just started screaming. I tried to pull my hand out but I couldn't, when I finally got it free there was a black hand print around my wrist. I turned away and started yelling for my friend, but when she got back the hand print was gone.

Only my friend who also saw the ghost in the first encounter believes me on that one. No one believes me with the second one. I hope someone does.

My Imaginary Ghost Friend,"Michigan, United States",Misc,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Misc :: My Imaginary Ghost Friend

H i it's Amber again. I have a lot of stories to tell, but this is my most favorite one. I was in kindergarden and I had an imaginary friend named girl. She looked like a real little girl and I did everything with her, like go to school. One day at gym class we were playing dodge ball, girl was on my team and when the other team threw the ball, one kid said ""hey girl is out, she got hit!"" and everyone started laughing. I looked at girl and she pulled out a knife and I told everyone ""watch out! girl has a knife and is going to kill you!"". Someone said ""give it up amber, girl is an imaginary friend, she ain't real!"". It was a ghost spirit that was my friend and I could only see her on saturday morning. Girl told me one day to jump off the roof so we could be best friends forever. I went on the roof and my mom saw me and I was finally off the roof, but she was holding me by my sleeve. She let go but thanks to my dad, I am still living because he caught me!

My mom went to the doctors and asked ""why is it like this imaginary friend is real?"". They said it's likely for all little boys and girls to have an imaginary friend. The next day my mom took me to the same doctor and I was in a room with him, in private, and I gave him a picture of a ghost. He asked ""whom is this?"". I responded ""girl"". Next, he asked ""who gave it to you?"". I said ""girl"". He said ""very well"" and told me to leave. He quickly called my mom in and showed her the picture. She asked what it was and he said it's from Amber and it is girl. ""It seems as if she has an ghost friend"". My mom said ""what it's impossible, a ghost, why can't I see it?"" He said ""I don't really know, did you ever bless the house before?"" She told him no.  ""Well all you have to do is go with your daughter and tell the spirit to leave!"". Then later that night, my mom did  that and all of a sudden, the lights went out, my mom saw a little girl's spirit and it ran outside. It really worked.

PS: I don't remember this at all, my mom told me this had happened to me. Comments are welcome to all of my stories and there are more stories were that came from.

Call 9,"Colorado, United States",Haunted Places,"H ello again. The story I'm about to tell you happened VERY recently, like in the past handful of weeks. And it's still been going on even up till yesterday. Haven't really seen that coughing ghost (see The Sick Man .) today, but he's been around since I was in like fourth grade. Anyway, here we go.

I yawned. The day had moved slowly for me. Sitting there, staring upon piles of homework, I nearly gagged. Vengeful thoughts raced my mind as I scribbled in answers and skimmed through pages. Enough! I thought. I was getting so tired of it that I had to stand up and stretch. My girlfriend Krystal entered my mind. Hmm. I'll call her and see what she's up to. I strolled out of my room and headed off to the right. Up the stairs I went, wishing someone could just come and collect my soul and take me from this hell.

When I got the top of the stairs, instantly I could tell it was cloudy outside. The snow had fallen and fallen the past few weeks, non stop. A friend of mine had wanted to go snow boarding the next time it snowed hard. But when the time came, he simply said, ""Nah, it snowed too much"", or something. I sneered at the thought as I picked up the phone and dialed Krystal's number. No more than two seconds after finishing I heard a raspy coughing downstairs. Not again.... Go away, for crying' out loud!

""Hello?"" Krystal said. ""Yo, how you doing'."" I replied. We began talking, until the coughing sound returned. What do you want from me?! Who are you?! One thing I always wondered was if this could be the ghost of my grandpa. I'd never met him, and his heavy smoking was what killed him. After finishing  my conversation with Krystal I slammed the phone down as ""Ghuuuuuuuuuughu ghuuuuughaaaa..."" emanated from downstairs. I sighed angrily. ""Do you need some cough syrup or something?!"" I of course got no response.

I'd been encountering this ghost for years, and in all that time, I'd never once seen its face. I'd only had hallucinations and seen parts of it, like its legs or arms. From what I could tell, it was a man. Sort of skinny, average height, grayish white skin, a worn gray tank top, and green pants. But, no shoes. He also never seems to be transparent. It's like he's really there. He casts a shadow and everything. Typically I see him during periods of sleep paralysis, and sometimes I have dreams about him, where it's like... *more* than a dream. He's always just standing there staring at me (or at least I assume he is; again, I've never seen his face).

I angrily headed for the stairs and looked down. I didn't see any shadow moving away, as the light was cast at the stairs from around the corner. But I could hear shifting feet. Our basement is odd. The part you step into at the bottom of the stairs is finished, but to the right, there's this big unfinished part that's always dark, and full of boxes and bags ever since we moved. Sometimes I could sense the coughing ghost.... Let's call him Jerry. I could sense Jerry in there sometimes, staring out at me blankly. What the heck does he want from me?! Who is he?! These questions circle my head every time I feel him nearby.

One night, in fact, I awoke very late and saw my bedroom door closing. It was dark in the hall, too, and I could just barely make out a pale arm gripping the handle. My mom wouldn't have even been up yet, as it was 3:41 AM. But anyway, back to the point. In my room, I decided, ""Ahh, [heck] with this."" So I headed back up stairs. I was almost to the top, when I turned and looked back down. ""Ghuuuuha ghuuuuhaaaaa...."" I was really steamed. ""Shut up!"" I yelled. There were fifteen steps. I was almost at the top, with two more steps to go. I looked down the stairs again, and suddenly.... There was only one step behind me. I looked up again, and there was the full fourteen more ahead. Ok, you wanna fight, Jerry?! I turned and rushed toward the dark area. ""Come out here and show yourself, I'm tired of this!""

No reply. I turned, and noticed a shadow heading up the stairs s-l-o-w-l-y. I snickered and hurried to the foot of the stairs. Jerry really sped up and got up to the top before I could see him. I could hear him walking across the kitchen floor! I'd never really heard his footsteps before, except when his feet are shifting and walking away from me, but today was special. I must have really pissed him off somehow. Did I breathe wrong?! Suddenly the phone rang again, and I couldn't sense Jerry anymore. Then again, I don't really know how accurate my ""senses"" are about these things, but it's a feeling that I'm not alone.

The phone kept ringing, so I rushed up to answer it. I looked at the i.d. The screen didn't display anything like... 555-555-5555, but instead it displayed 9. Nothing but the number 9. Unknown Caller, and then the number 9. I didn't even answer it. But again, the i.d. did not keep track of the call, so I have no proof of any of these things. That's what bothers me. It's always when I'm alone that Jerry visits our house. He always has some weird hallucination to cause me. Once, I looked in the mirror and something was weird about my reflection. My eyes.... they looked bloodshot. I always get plenty of sleep, so what's up with that? Also when I lifted my arm that same time, it took my reflection about half a second to do the same thing. I just wish somebody could tell me what they think Jerry wants. I'm tired of him, he annoys me (doesn't scare me anymore though), and I just wish he'd leave me alone.

Electric or Ghost?,"Texas, United States",Family / Friends Visits,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Family / Friends Visits :: Electric or Ghost?

T his is actually an event that happened to my father. When he was a youngster, probably around ten or twelve, his cousin and him were sleeping on a fold-out couch downstairs in the living room. While everyone else was sleeping, my father happened to see the medal bars in the window pane light up witch looked like a flow of electricity in it.

The electricity (possibility, it was electricity) formed into an electric ball of some sort, then it floated across the living room towards the thermo-stat and somehow, in a way, entered it and everything in the house went silent, the air-conditioning went off and the lights, just everything. After everything came back on my father and his cousin looked at each other with amazement asking , ""Whoa did you just see what I saw?"".

They both happened to see the same thing, but here's the twisted part, my great-grandfather just happened to have died a week or so earlier, and my father's cousin told him that he thought he saw their grandfather's face on the supposedly ""floating ball"". To this day, I try to solve whether if it was electricity or a possibility of my great-grandfather saying his last goodbye to the living.

Kristen's House,"Texas, United States",Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: Kristen's House

A fter my friend Kristen's Graduation party in fifth grade, my friends, Brooke, Jackie, Jordan, Liz, and I were sleeping over. We were inside sitting on the floor in the living room, talking about all that girl stuff, and gossip.

Well, behind us was a window and we heard a loud sound, so we turned our heads in that direction to see what it was. Kristen's parents weren't home except us and all of us were sitting together. Anyway, we thought something fell, so we ignored it, but then the blinds on the window started to open by themselves and close really fast. It kept on doing that until we ran outside into the backyard next to Kristen's pool.

While we were freaking out, I felt cold and a sense of something wrong, and felt like there was presence with us, like we weren't alone. Jackie and me just kept staring at each other not knowing what to do, when suddenly I was pushed into the pool, but no one was around me to do that, all I remember is feeling something cold, yet hot, push me into the pool.

As I tried to swim back up, something had my leg. Finally, one of my friends hopped into the pool to pull me back up before I drowned, when she pulled me to the steps I was to shocked to say anything. I looked back into the water and I though I saw a black shadow when nothing was there to make the shadow... in the water, but next to it was the pool cleaner, so I didn't know whether my leg was caught in that or something pure evil had a grip on me.

We got out of the water quickly and went to the brick fence, we sure didn't wanna go inside or stay in the same spot. So, we grabbed a chair to hop over it. My friend Kristen was going first, when she got over, my friend Jordan went next, then I did, but as soon as I got up there, I felt a worse feeling and decided to go last, so when it was just Jackie and me left, we heard a car honk and someone yell, ""I'm calling the cops you stupid f****** kids!""

In seconds, everyone hopped back over and looked amazed and horrified. ""Something, hit that man's window and it broke, it wasn't us."" My friend Brooke said with everyone else nodding.

The guy in the car drove around the house a couple times and finally left. Everyone was crying until Kristen's mom came home, so we felt a bit better. Everyone went to Jordan's house later on that night.

No one knows what happened that day, but it still frightens me thinking about it, I haven't gone back to Kristen's house ever since.

Grandfather Returns,"New Jersey, United States",Family / Friends Visits,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Family / Friends Visits :: Grandfather Returns

T his is a story that my mom had told me when I was little, and still tells today. She was only 5 years old at the time, so some might find it hard to believe the mind of a 5 year old. But anyway, it starts off after my mother's grandfather had died a week beforehand.

My mom said that she had always been her grandfather's favorite granddaughter out of her 3 other sisters. So one night, she woke up in the middle of the night, only to see him standing at the end of her bed with his hand out. He said, ""Come with me, Judy."" My mom was so terrified that she just screamed until everyone woke up and asked her what happened. My mom wasn't at all reluctant to include in her story that when she told her mom what happened to her, her mom (my grandmother) had also seen a ghost in that house before.

She woke up in the middle of the night and saw a boy walking around her room. The boy looked to be lost she always said, which makes sense with why it would be wondering around some random house.

That's about it, because they were both two very short stories. Hope you enjoy them.

Former Doll Owners,"Maine, United States",Apparitions / Voices / Touches,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Apparitions / Voices / Touches :: Former Doll Owners

M y friend Margaret, (She's in her late 80's), is experiencing some problems. She loves dolls. She just bought a ton of dolls at an auction. They were from around the early 1800's.

A couple nights ago, she had them all spread out on her dining room table, and she left them there when she went to bed. About 12:00 that morning, she heard a noise, and she woke up, and got out of bed to go see what it was. As she walked through the hall and into the dining room, she saw a little boy sitting at her table. She walked a little closer, and saw that the whole side of his face was burned, like maybe he had been caught in a fire? So she started shaking her cane at him and started yelling at him, saying things like, ""Who are you? What are you doing in my house?"" And so on. The little boy looked up at her, stood up, then disappeared.

This, of course, startled her, and she spun around to go back through the hall. Now her den is right next to her dining room. As she spun around, something caught her eye in the den. She looked in again, and saw a man staying above her coffee table looking at something. She started yelling again, and the man immediately disappeared.

Okay, that was a couple nights ago. Now last night, she was sleeping, and around 5:00am, she heard a noise, and woke up again. This time to see a young lady, in a pre civil war type skirt (full length and such). The lady had a small, fine paintbrush in her hand, and it looked like she was painting the mirror that Margaret has on her wall. Margaret started yelling at her, and she disappeared.

She eventually fell back asleep, when at 7:00am, she woke up and saw a young black girl, about 14 maybe, standing at the end of her bed. She was wearing the same type of dress. The girl looked like she was looking down at something near Margaret's feet. Again. Margaret yelled at her, adn the ghost disappeared.

She's pretty freaked out, and she can't figure out why this is happening. I think it has something to do with the dolls. That day after the sighting of the little boy and the man, she packed all the dolls up and put them away in a spare room. I think these ghosts might be the owners of these dolls, and their just looking for them. We have tried to convince her that she needs to try to talk to them, but she refuses.

Weird Stuff In My House,"California, United States",Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: Weird Stuff In My House

I live in California. I have had a few ghost experiences. One was when I was at school. My Mom had some friends over. Their names are Tammy and Chrissie. My Mom's friend recently has passed away. This event occurred in November 2006. She was talking about her friend who passed away and she went to go get some wine glasses from her cupboard. She grabbed one and left it open for a second. All of the glasses flew off the shelf and shattered on the floor. The hardest part of the glasses broke, and the softest part of the glasses didn't even have a scratch. ALL of them were like this.

Another event that happened was just recently, in December 2006. I was in the shower and I felt a hand rubbing up and down my back. I was confused for a second, but it was astonishing because no one was there. I stepped back from the water, and then when I got the courage to step back, the water was ice cold. I was confused for a moment because I had the water temperature on warm. I turned it back to warm, freaking out. I rushed out of the shower so I could get into my bedroom. I then stepped out of the shower and almost fell back. The entire bathroom was covered in fog. The water wasn't even hot enough to fog.

In December 2006 again, my Mom was cleaning the house. She heard some noises and thought nothing of it. She was dusting off the TV. And then she went to go get another rag and all the TVs turned on in all the rooms. My mom then turned them all off. Then all the computers turned on. My mom turned them back off, then the water in the bathtub's starting running so she turned them off and got out of the house for the day and went to the mall with her friends.

This month is January 2007. I was awake at 12:00 midnight. I was talking to my boyfriend, Seth, on the phone. I had an attic. I heard some footsteps up there while I was talking to him. I thought nothing of it, until I heard stomping. The attic is locked and no one has been up there in months. The only time anyone goes up to the attic is to fix the power cords or reinstall a new fan or something.

So I have no clue who has been in my house, but I have had scary thing happen. I did some research and it said no one has passed away in my house. I wonder where these spirits are coming from. My family is into tarot, and some witchcraft. I saw a psychic awhile back and got my fortune done. She said in my past life, I was drowned by a family member. When I was 5, I was speaking Latin in my sleep and I don't even know Latin. To this day when I am in certain location or houses I don't know, I speak Latin. The night I spoke it in my sleep, my mom did research to see what I was saying. I was saying ""no! stop leave me alone! I didn't do anything to you! Stop please I beg of you!!"". Then I started screaming.

Jerry III,"Colorado, United States",Misc,"T his story is gonna be shorter than The Sick Man , and Call 9 . Because it pretty much just happened a day ago. I came home from school, and I was on my way back home... There's like this alley that leads from the school parking lot to behind my neighborhood, and eventually there's a hole that you step through and you're in my parking lot, and my house is like *right there*.

So anyway, I was halfway to the alley. I was walking with my friend RJ, and noticed this person standing there up the slope (there's this hill that goes up a little, then curves down again and that's where the hole in the fence is). At first it looked like a little kid, then I could see that the guy's legs were hidden a little as I was looking up at him from down the slope. Guess what this guy was wearing? Faded gray tank top, green pants, and his skin was real pale. He quickly turned and walked away once my buddy and I were close enough. There's been snow all over the ground for days since we had like five blizzards in a row. If this dude wasn't wearing shoes (see Call 9 ), then I was going to say something, whether RJ saw him or not. He DIDN'T seem to see the guy though, which was weird. I didn't say anything though because RJ was rambling.

Of course, when we got to the top of the hill, NO DUDE THERE. Sorry, no JERRY there. I still didn't get to see his face though. I mean I could sort of tell he HAD one, but he was too far away. His hair seems to be buzz cut, and gray like his skin (but darker). That was the first time I saw Jerry not only outside the house, but when I WASN'T ALONE! What is up with that?! And, another creepy hallucination he caused me! I got to the top of the hill and saw that the fence hole was gone. I stopped for a minute and looked at RJ, then looked at the fence. THE HOLE WAS BACK AGAIN! I said goodbye to RJ and went into the house, but I didn't see any sign of Jerry all night. If this persists I'm seeking a doctor. I tell Jerry to get... the heck outta my house, but he doesn't. Now he's even added a new sound to his vocabulary. Sneezing! Twice I've heard ""Akccchhuhuhhhh!"" and said ""SHUT UP!"" but yelling does no good. Talking to him CALMLY does no good! If I yell, at least he causes me a bunch of hallucinations and goes away for a while, like his way of giving me the finger. If I just say ""Stop please."" he does nothing. But sitting here at my desk sometimes I turn and look down the hall and see his shadow moving past. I actually did leave a pen and paper in the hallway for several hours so that MAYBE he could finally tell me why he's been after me for all these years, but... nothing happened. I didn't even see any sign of him in that time, nor have I seen him today (except for a sneeze from upstairs).

Poe's Palace,"New Jersey, United States",Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: Poe's Palace

W hen I was in High School, I worked summers at a seaside resort.  I had tried several jobs my first year but settled into a fun house based on Edgar Allen Poe's stories. The second day I noticed footsteps coming down the long passage way that stopped.  Finally I looked and no one was there.  I didn't think anything of it.  After about a week other people started talking about strange happening, nothing violent or really freaky.  There were strange lights, the sound of keys rattling and the disappearing footsteps.  They seemed to occur in two different areas more so than any other place.  We then started noticing two distinct behavioral pattern, Edgar and Allen.  Allen was more playful, shining lights in our faces before disappearing.  Edgar just seemed to walk around and around, up the front stairs and passed the graveyard scene.

The second year a runaway showed up and was immediately the target of Edgar and Allen.  She had a bandana that was double knotted hanging from her belt loop.  When it was found in the graveyard scene, it was still double knotted and her belt loop was intact.  Every time she was inside the house, she fell victim to some harmless prank.  Finally, she started dating one of the guys and was sitting on his lap, making out, when a 2x4, used to bar the door at night, flipped over and knocked her out.  The way it was in the corner, it should have slid down the wall.  Flipping over was just impossible for the angle it had.  But it gave her a nasty bump and, I think, a mild concussion.  Two days later I saw a hand pull behind a curtain and felt something VERY wrong.  The scene was constructed like a box on its side.  The front was the only way in or out.  I screamed louder than anyone had ever heard me and some worker came running.  Once they arrived I went into the scene, but it was empty.  I then sat and meditated and asked why this was happening.  I saw two visions.  One was the runaway biting a guys hand and the other was her hitchhiking, and I felt it was September.  I asked her not to hitchhike in September.  Two nights later a guy associated with the haunted house, but not an actual employee inside, invited her to a party.

When she arrived at the house with him a bunch of guys came out and raped her at gun point.  She said later that she bite a guys hand and that is when they put the gun to her head.  They felt that, since she was a runaway, she wouldn't press charges because then she would get sent home.  A few weeks later, in September, she was hitchhiking back from a Grateful Dead concert and got picked up as a runaway by the police.

It was the only time Edgar and Allen had ever been violent, and it was to protect her.  Only one other person knew about the visions I had.  No one knew exactly what I saw except a girl named Dottie.  She said she never told anyone but was a little freaked about how I knew in advance about the other girl biting the guys hand.

By the way, someone said they had done some research on it and were told that two worker died on the site when the original structure was constructed, some 25 years earlier.

Haunting at Reed Candle Factory,"Texas, United States",Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: Haunting at Reed Candle Factory

M y aunt works at Reed Candle factory and has many stories to tell about her experiences there. She told us that one time, she was in a room of the factory working the machines, when she heard the sound of a man whispering, even though at the time, she was alone in the room.  Another time, my aunt told me that when she went to work (it was an early shift so it was only her and another woman there), she was working the machines when she looked up and saw the figure of a man in the factory, but it was only the shadow, not the details and everything so she could not really distinguish him very well. She didn't describe him but she did say the they are pretty sure that the founder, Peter Reed, still visits the factory, and my aunt is also pretty sure that the man she saw was the founder.  Another time, she was in the factory when she could sense someone watching her from somewhere, although my aunt looked around, the other workers were working and didn't seem to notice the very heavy but pleasant presence (the way she described it) somewhere there.

Also my aunt told me that, one time, she was working when she felt a cold chill pass through her, although the central heating was on at the time and there were no windows open in the factory.  I think that along like everybody else, it is indeed the founder, Peter Reed, still visiting his beloved factory, and that he is harmless, which is why my aunt told us that she was used to all those happenings and that they no longer bother her but give her pleasure.  Well, that's all she said. If you could give me some feedback of what YOU think it is, please feel free to leave me a comment.

Many Ghosts,"Oklahoma, United States",Psychic / Medium,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Psychic / Medium :: Many Ghosts

I have been able to see and talk to ghosts since I was little. For the most part they are nice, playful ghosts but there is this one evil entity called the cloud-man. He is tall, wears all black, and holds you down to where you cannot move or breathe. Both my mother and I have seen him many times over the years. I would say at least once a week. He causes the bed to shake and paralysis to us both. There is also a young woman about 19 or older that is named Amy who was my mother in a past life. She wears an old timey white nightgown and can be seen just about anywhere I go. She always frequents the hallway and goes to my bedroom and then the bathroom. There's also a little boy is a sailor suit. He's about 5 and moves things around and hides things from us. There was one time where he moved a table in front of me and caused me to break my arm. He didn't mean to hurt me though. There are also 3 older people but I do not see them only my mother sees them. I have been told by a psychic that both my mother and I are highly psychic. I am extremely interested in spirits, good and bad. I have a lot of stories so if you're interested just let me know and I'll tell you some of my experiences.

Orbs during Sleepover,"Maryland, United States",Orbs / Lights / Mists,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Orbs / Lights / Mists :: Orbs during Sleepover

M e and my friend sierra were having a sleepover at her house one night.  We saw flashing out the window, and thought it was lightning but we didn't hear anything, so we kept on staring out her window and saw 3 orbs. At the time we didn't know they were orbs, we didn't know what they were. 30 minutes later, we were still looking out the window and we saw them go behind the trees. The trees were pretty close to us (they were behind the house in front of sierras) and I said ""what the heck is that... it can't be a plane because it just went behind the tree. It's too small."". Then sierra thought about it for a while and said that it might be an orb. I didn't believe her at first, but I thought about it and it's the only thing it could be. We got so scared. She told her mom and she said to go away (this was at like 10:00 pm) so after that, we went to the floor and put the covers over our heads and went to sleep.

The next day we told everyone. Nobody believed us. 3 days after that, we had another sleepover but our other friend, danielle, was with us. She knew about it and didn't really believe us at first and made it a joke that night. She kept on saying ""hey guys, let's go take pictures of orbs!"". She was just playing around though. We heard her mom get up and rushed to our beds. She was yelling at her dog who kept on barking, then yelled ""get the f**** out of my yard!"". We didn't know who she was yelling at. She then came downstairs and kept saying ""sierra, sierra, jenny wake up"". I sat up and sierra's mom asked us what we saw the other night and we told her. She said she just saw that in her backyard, one was above the swingset and the other was by sierra's mom's window. When she yelled ""get out of my yard"" they slowly went back into the woods. She said they were flashing and it looked like they were taking pictures of her. She was in her underwear too, so it was weird and scary. We ran up to sierra's room and we all slept on the floor.

The scary thing was that the only time the orbs would come is when it looked like there was lightning, but no thunder at all. Now sometimes we would randomly take pictures and look for orbs. One time, sierra's friend came over and took a picture of her bathroom, there was a little girl standing right in the middle. It creeped everyone out. Now that sierra's mom saw what we saw, everyone knows it now and believes us, even though sometimes they would joke about it. It really bothers me how parents never believe kids. I know they lie sometimes, but who cares, me, sierra and danielle were so freaked out that night.

The Little Boy in a Sailor suit and the Cloud Man,"Oklahoma, United States",Psychic / Medium,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Psychic / Medium :: The Little Boy in a Sailor suit and the Cloud Man

H i again, since I was about 5 years old, I have seen and talked to billy , the little boy in a sailor suit. He always played with me, told me things that happened to him and he showed me things that would happen in the future. He was murdered by his step-father and buried in a field. I saw it like I was there. Once he showed me a woman that had been murdered and was laying in a tub full of blood. Later, I found out that in Oklahoma City a woman was murdered, just like that. You would think that would have freaked me out, but I guess I just thought it was normal to see those things. My mother is also psychic. I would really like to know what everyone thinks about what I see and hear. Thanks!

The cloud man, or the man in black, is an evil entity that rapes and abuses my mother and sometimes me. He has this oppressive atmosphere anytime he is around. When I was little, my mother and I were laying in her bed, about to go to sleep, because my bed kept shaking. We turned off the light and then seconds later, the bed starts to shake violently. We cannot move or breathe and the covers are pulled down. After about 5 minutes of the bed shaking, it stopped. We still have experiences like that, but not as violent as the bed shaking. He puts bruises on my mother, scratches, and rapes me. His name is Michael and he has followed us everywhere we go. We have learned to live with it. The other ghost that are around us try to protect us and warn us. Amy, who used to be my mother in another life, protects me. My mother almost named me Amy instead of Jamie. Well thanks for reading and tell me what you think!

A Haunting in Jackson,"California, United States",Ghost Hunting,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Ghost Hunting :: A Haunting in Jackson

T his is my first time experiencing a true paranormal investigation. Call us ghost hunters, ghost busters, ghost tracers, but to be more formal, we can be called paranormal investigators. The outfit is called H.P.I. (Haunted and Paranormal Investigations) of Northern California. The president is the lovely Shannon McCabe. Shannon is a unique individual that also is a vocalist and is involved with vocal lessons, recording, band management and bookings, event planning, floral design and has her own web site . This talented woman also seeks the truth of hauntings and maintains a skeptical mind on all events that are witnessed by her outfit H.P.I. She seeks a scientific explanation, or when all scientific possibilities are eliminated, it leaves only one answer. The paranormal. January 20, 2007, Saturday, I found myself arriving at The National Hotel, 2 Water Street, Jackson, CA.

Roll Call for H.P.I. Investigators that don't mind having their names disclosed were: Shannon McCabe, President; Brian Colbert; Julie English; Paul Dale Roberts; Mary Casiano; Anne Temple (Spiritual/Psychic Reader); John Wachter; Jonathan Russell; Alicia; Michelle Paykel. There were 28 H.P.I. paranormal investigators and other names will be withheld for their privacy.

The National Hotel in Jackson, California dates back to the 1800s. Guests of the hotels have witnessed many paranormal events. The total number of entities in the hotel have been documented to a big 30. When I arrived, their was a band playing and patrons gyrating on the dance floor to rock and roll and R&B. One of the songs, fit the mood.  She Blinded me with Science. One of the buzzed patrons yelled out... ""happy ghost hunting!"" The HPI investigators were setting up video cameras in all locations of the floors of the hotel. The lap tops were turned on to analyze electronic voice phenomenon. In one recording you could distinctly hear a female voice say the word 'chill'. I became familiar with a Gauss aka E.M.F. (electro magnetic field reader). Brian Colbert, another paranormal investigator briefed me on a Tempgun, which detects the influx of temperature. Very good in reading 'cold spots'.

When the band and patrons left, the lights went out and the investigators had access to more rooms. In one room called The Bordello, I felt a thickness in the air. When leaving this room and returning perhaps an hour later, the thickness was gone. Armed with my digital camera, I took pictures of various areas of the hotel. The method is to take two pictures of each area, so there is no misinterpretation of the picture taken. The spirits must have been attracted to Julie English. She took many photos with her digital camera and picked up many 'orbs' in her photographs. Julie English at 1:52am took a photograph of a bath towel in Room 55 and an orb appeared in the photo. She snapped another photo of the bed in Room 55 and another orb appeared. I snapped photos of the same areas and no orbs appeared on my photographs.

One unsubstantiated claim was that intuitive Anne Temple claimed that a little girl made her presence known and followed John Wachter. During this incident an electronic magnetic field monitor device was used and witnessed by Michelle Paykel. The little ghostly spirit of the girl that followed John Wachter whispered 'Cindy'. Some of the patrons of the bar were curious on what H.P.I. was doing and one patron, name unknown claimed he was a psychic and claimed an angry man entity was walking up and down the hallway and that he was angry. This entity was mumbling gibberish and was completely incoherent. The psychic patron claimed this was a troubled spirit. Anne Temple followed up to say that he smoked a cigar and that he was yelling ""get out"". The patron psychic said he was 5' 10"", average aged man with an ethnic background. Observing the patron psychic, I detected that he was somewhat intoxicated. There was a time he was glass eyed and standing up against the wall. Shannon McCabe asked him...""what's wrong?"" He later told me that he receives headaches when there are too many ghosts around. One of the investigators asked him to leave, because we felt he was hindering on our investigations.

Shannon McCabe showed me around to various rooms. She is a seasoned investigator and as we sat in the dark, she would entice the spirit to show itself. While Shannon was trying to detect any Electronic Voice Phenomenon, any kind of noises that were being made, she would make the comment... ""someone's footsteps are being heard"" or ""Paul coughing"", so there is no confusion on what those noises are. Shannon enticed a spirit named ""Jeffrey"" and I snapped one photo over the bed area and captured 2 orbs on my camera. I snapped again, in the same direction of the orbs and there were no more orbs present in the 2nd photo. This was in Room 52 of the hotel.

One of the lady workers of the hotel related all kinds of ghost stories to us. She told us how a crashed echoed throughout the hotel, sounding like broken glass or broken wood and when walking into the room where the sound came from, they found no broken glass or wood. She explained that rooms with many sightings, were rooms 61, 47 and 45. One room, a cowboy male ghost is seen and that this ghost once told a little girl with a video camera... ""run bitch!"" Shannon and about 4 other paranormal investigators sat in that room, trying to entice the cowboy ghost. We had no results in this room. I later sat in this room by myself and felt no presence. I even dared to sit in dark closets by myself and even investigated the attic and no results. One unidentified woman paranormal investigator took a photo and got a misty white cloud on her digital photo. Michelle Paykel took a digital photo and a white blob appeared on the staircase digital photo. At 4:20am, more digital photos were taken in Room 60 and orbs appeared on the photographs.

The final story for this evening occurred in Room 47, the infamous Bordello Room with it's lavish provocative maroon decor and mirrors. This story is related to me by Mary Casiano, Jonathan Russell and Anne Temple, the Spiritual Reader of Bluepantherspirit.com . They witnessed or experienced everything from a poke in the neck, whispering, hair pulling, tugging on hair, a touch or brushing of the face, hands feeling cold, hair pushed back. Jonathan Russell claims he was sitting on a chair and felt a pressure on his lap and even felt like he was being groped. I went into the Bordello Room by myself and sat in the same chair as Jonathan. I sat in there for a good 20 minutes and experienced nothing. The only thing I experienced in this room, was earlier in the evening, I felt a thickness in the air.

Overall this was a fun learning experience and I hope our next investigation into a haunting will produce some exciting results. All digital photographs and Electronic Voice Phenomenon will be analyzed. The results are pending. For anyone interested in this field! Like the patron told me....""Happy Ghost Hunting!""

Paul Dale Roberts, www.jazmaonline.com 5606 Moonlight Way, Elk Grove, CA 95758 JazmaPika [at] cs.com  9162037503

Also present - H.P.I. Paranormal Investigators were: John Wachter - Assistant; Alicia Perry - Assistant.

One of the songs the band was playing at The National Hotel that fit the mood was: She Blinded Me with Science by Thomas Dolby.

I, Paul Dale Roberts noticed at one time the Bordello room reeked of musky stale perfume and when I went back, the smell was gone.

Shannon says: Orbs may possibly be dust spots, but further studying of them is required.

H i I'm whitney dampier. I'm 14 years old and this true story happened when I was 3-4 years old. I don't know how can I remember all of this. I actually only remember very little but I do know what happened. I was at my grandma's house, sitting in her living room alone. And I was just playing with a buzz light year toy. I looked up and saw a black figure. It wasn't blurry or disappeared fast, it just looked at me and walked threw a wall. It was pure solid black and had the shape of a cowboy hat and boots. I screamed and my mom and grandma ran in there and asked me what was wrong. They say I said ""man walked threw wall"". I asked my grandpa about this house when I was 13 years old. He said it was a civil war battle field when the war was going on. They built their house on that land. His grandma lilly saw a black boy get hung in the trees. And my grandpa said he saw a little civil war girl at the end of his bed. He looked closer she disappeared. So the ghost I and my family had seen must have been civil war people.

Haunted Old House,"Missouri, United States",Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: Haunted Old House

T he house my dad and bree live in has been there since late 1920's and it is a beautiful house. In the middle of the woods with big nice pond. One weekend, I went to my dads. He told me a story that had happened the day before. He was up stairs on the computer at home alone. Feebee, our dog, started to bark at the door. My dad looked out the window. No one was coming up the road. Dad went downstairs and she was still barking at the door. He looked out no one was there to bark at. He went back up stairs to continue playing his game. When he heard heavy foot steps going up the stairs, he turned and no one is there. He jumped out of his chair, looked around, but no one in sight.

I was freaked out by the story. That next weekend I had a friend over. I told tarah that the house was haunted. She did not believe me. We watched the texas chain saw massacre that night. So we were all ready scared. I said ""let's go to bed"". Then, we heard the faucet out side turning on and the water running. We looked out the window, but no one was there. It did it again and again. Then the pool balls upstairs were rolling as if some one was playing pool. We went up there but no one was up there. She said ""whitney, I believe you now!"". That next morning the pictures and paintings in frames were turned side ways. We ended up moving from that house.

Reminiscence,"Colorado, United States",Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: Reminiscence

H ello. To anyone who has read my other stories ( The Sick Man , Call 9 , Jerry III ), you know what I've experienced. A spirit, whom I've named ""Jerry"" (sort of a joke; I'm like Tom from Tom & Jerry, he's Jerry, and I'm hunting him) has been haunting me since I was very young, and almost right after my sister moved out. Well I'm going to talk now about some of those earlier encounters.

The guest room of our old house always scared me. By day, it was dark and scary. By night, it was darker and scarier. Not once could I look down the hall at the open door and not shiver a little bit. I always felt a presence inside the room that wanted to harm me, and ONLY me. Living in a family of three after my brother and sister left, I was always a bit relieved. My brother was the dictionary definition of a jerk, my sister was not much better, and I was screamed at almost daily for every little thing wrong I did. However, none of these hardships could amount to the fear that stirred within me, any time I would gaze down at that creepy, dark, silent, abandoned room...

Several rooms of the house caused me a bizarre feeling of dread that had no connection to the moment. Our basement, guest room, bathroom that connected my room and the guest room, and my parents' closet. I have had more than a few hundred dreams that revolved around these rooms, which seemed to talk to me, unlike a normal dream. I always wanted the door to the bathroom closed anytime I was in my room. Ever since I saw a shadow casting down from the other end, and both my parents were downstairs watching football. Not to mention I ran full-speed downstairs afterward, crying like... the kid I was. I had always had an active imagination, and I sometimes let it get away from me, but these occurrences were becoming too common. I had feared sleeping in my own room for several reasons: strange sounds (some of which were like growling), shadows, situational nightmares, silhouettes in my window, and the strangest was when I was trying to sleep; my eyes were closed, and suddenly there came what looked like this big, hollow, angry face glaring at me.

One thing I never experienced was sleep paralysis. That didn't come until eighth grade, when my worst experience with a ghost happened. That particular ghost whose name I've daubed ""Jerry"" may not have been the only thing I'd encountered in those days, but I could always see his shadow if he was around. Sometimes during the day I'd look down the hall at the guest room and see his shadow from around the corner casting from the window. Another time was in the basement. Now the basement is about 20 feet in diameter all around, with the stairs in the exact middle. There was one bedroom down there that was finished on the inside, and a long, dark, creepy passage that led nowhere, and had the fixings for a bathroom. But, we never did anything with it. Now then, here's a few things I experienced down there. The scariest part is all I ever saw were totally random hallucinations, and nothing with any explanation. A big face fades in and out on one wall and has big, bulging eyes. The light was on on one side, while the one on the other side was off, and I'd hear shifting footsteps there. I'd see a shadow casting down from the stairs and NOT hear anybody's footsteps as the figure turned to walk back up. Sometimes I wondered if my brother ever saw anything, because he was the one that told me about the weird shadow in the guest room (back when it was my sister's). But I was the only one that ever said anything. Of course mom and dad simply dismissed me as a ""little kid"".

Once in my parents' room, the lights were on and it wasn't dark or creepy inside. I was VERY young, probably only in kindergarten. So this was BEFORE my sister moved out. I was sitting there playing with toys right by the entrance door. The closet door sat just to the left of it, and it was always dark (except in the mornings when my dad got ready in there). As I sat there, I swear something very nasty started to crawl out and glare at me. Yeah it's funny, but it's no joke. I wouldn't be able to describe this thing now, but I only know it was definitely not friendly. And it wasn't so much a creature, but rather a presence. Except, it had a physical form. Crazy explanation: It was a demon stuck in our world, in our house, that hid in the shadows and only came out when I was around because I was a helpless kid. Reasonable explanation: I had an overactive imagination. You be the judge.

As far as Jerry goes, I never actually saw him until that day in eighth grade (The Sick Man) and he never left me alone after that.

So, here's one theory: Jerry was a ghostly victim of these demons I was always encountering and sought help from me, and stays with me hoping I'll keep the demons away from him.

I'm guessing it's not #3, because that's just ridiculous. These are just a few of my many spiritual encounters in my youth. All of them took place in the same house, and ONLY I experienced them (to the best of my knowledge). Whether that's true or not, I may never know. My mom has no interest in talking about my childhood unless it's school-related or about a family get-together, or one of the many ""cute"" things I did as a little kid, but it doesn't matter. I know what I've seen and experienced. And I think this site features many people who have endured similar things. Whatever it all was, it still happens to me from time to time nowadays.

Sleepless Nights,Canada,Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: Sleepless Nights

A few years ago, I lived in a fairly large house in a town called ""Deroche"". At the time, I was living with my Mother, step dad, stepbrother and cat. From the day I moved in, I would not be able to fall asleep, I would always feel like someone was in the room with me, watching.

My cat was also acting strangely, it was almost like she was watching someone move around my bedroom. Her eyes would go from one side of the room to another. She would meow very loudly during the night.

It wasn't just my bedroom, the whole house had a strange feeling to it. It is too hard to explain.

So one day at school I casually joked about my house being haunted. That was when one of my friends told me that there was a graveyard a couple blocks away from my house.

I decided to investigate further by asking some more of my friends if there were known spirits in the area. I discovered that there was a teenage African boy who was murdered, not far from my house, when some other boys tied him to the railroad tracks. (note: I do not verify that that story was real in any way, shape or form, it is just what I was told). I tried to search for more clues, but did not find any other stories.

Then, after a few weeks, I'd gotten more used to the feeling of the house, and started getting a few hours of sleep a night, but now I was almost constantly having nightmares (none of which I can remember). It was really starting to bother me, but there was nothing I could do about it.

So, a few days later, I invited a couple of friends over to jump on my trampoline after school. We were jumping around, talking and having a good time when suddenly, I heard a shriek from my friend, she pointed at the basement door, when I looked over, I could see what she was screaming about. The door (which is ALWAYS closed and locked) was opening and closing by itself. We were so freaked, we ran inside and asked my Mom if anyone was down there, she told us that no one had gone down there all day.

Since then I have moved into a different house, but I still wonder what was there...

Unknown Voice,"North Carolina, United States",Apparitions / Voices / Touches,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Apparitions / Voices / Touches :: Unknown Voice

O ne morning, when I was getting dressed for school, I was about to turn on the T. V. when I heard a little girl's voice, about the age of 6-9, say ""where's my mommy?"". It scared the crap out of me! I was so scared that I ran out of my room, leaving my sister alone sleeping, and went to the kitchen. My grandma told me it was nothing, so I went back in. When it was lunch time at school, I was in line and I was talking to my friends behind me. The line in front of me was down where the cashier was. Then I felt someone pull my ear ring and say ""come on!"" with the same voice I heard in my room! So I turned around and the cashier was waiting for me at the end! I think there is a ghost of a little girl following me!

The Dream that Led Me to an Angry Spirit,"Arizona, United States",Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: The Dream that Led Me to an Angry Spirit

A bout two weeks ago, I had a dream. Me, my daughter and my husband were in this house that we apparently purchased. Might I add, we are not looking to buy. I was on the back patio talking to this old lady. In my dream, I knew she was a spirit but a nice one. When I explained I was moving in, she no longer was in a present state where I could see her. She was angry and I would yell at her to not throw things. She was very angry and threw a christmas pine tree on my daughter. The door bell rang, so I answered it, there were three men at the door, with my cell phone and keys, the side of the house was beautiful brick pavers and pine trees line the walk. I asked the men ""where did you get my phone?"" they replied down the block. My phone was broke, only the screen was intact. I knew I left it in the back patio area. I hit the picture button on my phone to discover the horrible old lady's picture on it. This woke me up. The next night I went to bed and had another dream. We purchased a house and in the bedroom there was a horrible entity that I couldn't see, only feel. When I walked into the room, it would hold me back. Again, woke up in a sweat.

Two days later, my husband received a phone call and had been secretly trying to surprise me about getting a mortgage to purchase a home. I was so taken back, I told him about my dreams. For the next couple of days, I went looking for houses in historical Phoenix, I always loved the architecture. We looked  at about 75 houses, but nothing that really hit me. The day I went on my own, I was looking for a particular house and was lost. Going down the street, there was a speed bump, so I slowed down. On the right hand side, there was a old lady sitting in the middle of a wet empty lot, petting a cat. My first thought was ""oh she's homeless, but why is she sitting in the middle of a dirt lot?"". To my left was a beautiful pink abandoned victorian house. ""Wow!"", I thought, ""a victorian house in the middle of Phoenix!"". I wondered if it was for sale. The gate was locked, so I climbed over. Going down the side of the house, there was pine trees and a brick walk. When I got to the side door I felt an uneasy feeling, hard to describe, I felt ill and very scared, not remembering any of my dreams at this time. I started talking to the house ""ok I'm leaving, I just wanted to see how beautiful you were"", running in my slippers out of the yard. Across the street, next to the empty lot, was three men. I asked them if they knew about the house. He replied ""It's been empty for over 20 years"". I asked if it was for sale, he said no, the old man lives down the block and occasionally comes there to hang a ""keep out"" sign. I replied that it was strange. I was writing him a letter to leave in the mail box, I told him of my interest and about the feeling I experienced and to please call me.

Later on that day my mother told that my dreams had come true and to stay away from there. I brought my daughter back with me so I could take some pictures with my cell phone. Well, when I sent it to my computer, there she was, clear as a bell, the woman in the second floor window. Going to bed that night, of course, my mind was thinking. So in the next dream, I was in a pink victorian house and I kept tripping over this old lady with long hair, she kept replying ""again, next week"". Then I woke up. Wondering what does next week hold for me.

Do You See What I See?,"Indiana, United States",Psychic / Medium,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Psychic / Medium :: Do You See What I See?

H i, my name isn't John, that's my best friends name. Almost everyone has a best friend but the thing is most people's best friend are still alive. My friend John isn't alive though. He passed away at the age of 2-4, in a car explosion with his mother and father. His mom died too but his dad still lives. He just showed up in my house one day, for no dang reason. He just felt there was someone alive he could talk to. My parents say I have been talking to spirits my whole life. Even when I was like 3 years old, I would just be trying to say something when nobody was there. I told someone in my class about it, and he told the whole class. Everybody made fun of me.

I also have a friend named Allie, she is really nice, like most girls are, but she isn't the peppy kind of girl or anything, she's just a nice girl. I am only in 7th grade and I have seen demons trying to hurt me and try to take over me. You probably don't believe me and this sounds retarded, stupid, and crazy, but I just wanted to say something.

Oh I almost forgot this ""psychic ability"", or whatever you want to call it, originally came from my mother. And John wants to say ""Hi everybody how are you?"".

Can a Living Person Create a Ghost?,"California, United States",Misc,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Misc :: Can a Living Person Create a Ghost?

A few years ago, I lost my spouse in an accident, at christmas. I was pregnant with our baby. The police came and told me my husband was killed instantly in a car accident. For a few years, I paced our home at night crying, holding my stomach because it was painful, a lot of times at our kitchen sink, mourning his death. A few years later, I sold our home. I moved into my new home. A neighbor came and told me one day that she had met the owners of my old home, at a yard sale. They had told her that the home was haunted! They saw every year around the holidays a pregnant apparition crying, and pacing around the house, often in front of the kitchen sink. The women who bought the house said she had pains in her stomach in the kitchen...

My Encounters With an Unseen Force,"Texas, United States",Old Hags / Night Attacks / Sleep Paralysis,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Old Hags / Night Attacks / Sleep Paralysis :: My Encounters With an Unseen Force

O ther than one other soul, I have never discussed this before.  I have researched sleep paralysis in depth and for a while I believed it to be the cause of my experiences. These experiences have only happened in my parents house. On numerous occasions I would wake up in bed, totally incapable of moving anything, but I could blink my eyes.  I felt an immense weight on my chest, but nothing was there, just darkness.  Not really like a shadow but a darkness.  It would speak to me... Always saying similar things, and it was always the same grim raspy whisper. I could not move or say anything.  I tried to scream and scream, but no sound would come out.

I know this sounds exactly like sleep paralysis and I rode it off as such for a long time.  I would have liked to believe these visits where just me dreaming and nothing more.  However, whenever I am not sleeping at my house this has never happened. Not once. When I was living elsewhere it never happened, but when I moved back home it started again.  Never anywhere else.  I kept all this to myself until my cousin came to stay with us for a few months.  He had never had this type of experience until he came to stay with us.  Several nights in a row he said he woke up with something choking him, and he couldn't move or talk. He didn't tell me this until after it had happened about three nights in a row.  He asked me out the blue if I believed in ghosts.  I didn't say anything.  He then began to tell me about what had been happening to him. I began to tell him about what had been going on, and I told him I thought it was odd that it hasn't happened to me since he came to stay with us. He was very frightened by the whole ordeal and we began discussing it.  The thing that really bothered me has how he was explaining exactly what I was going through without me saying anything to him about it.  Even the types of things in which it said to him where almost exactly like what it was saying to me. Even the voice matched the once I had been hearing. Now up to this point, I guess a person could chalk all this up to sleep paralysis or some rational explanation.

What happened next, however, is far more chilling and much harder to rationally explain.  While we were discussing this I noticed a sharp change in the room's climate.  In seemed very cold, but only in one part of the room and no where else.  I don't remember exactly what was said right before the noise, but we where talking about ways to get rid of it when we where silenced by a strange growling sound.  It did not sound like anything else I have ever heard in my entire life.  The best way to sum it up would be a high pitched wail like a cat in great pain.  The noise seemed to move around us like it was moving towards the door. He looked at me strangely and then suddenly my door slammed shut. It was wide open and it rapidly closed... and I mean hard. This all happened within several seconds.

Since that day neither him nor I have ever had a similar experience. I sleep much better now, and I haven't had anything even remotely similar to this happen to me this that day nor has my cousin.

The East Window,Australia,Apparitions / Voices / Touches,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Apparitions / Voices / Touches :: The East Window

I am sixteen years old and before I can remember, my family have always insisted on weekend trips with friends into the country or to the coast. So when the October holidays (two years ago) came, we were off to the Woodhouse homestead in the Adelaide Hills. I've love old buildings ever since I was little, but upon reaching this particular house, I couldn't help but feel a little resentful and nervous as I entered the front door. The homestead was a two storey building, with numerous dorm rooms upstairs, a large kitchen, and an attached outhouse. It was dark before the first of our friends arrived and I seemingly jumped at every shadow that moved. Fortunately, soon the house was filled with adults' chatter downstairs, and children's laughter as they raced each other up and down the staircase.

My friend Mel and I were setting up her family's room (number 4) upstairs, while all the children were now downstairs, delighting in ghost stories told around the parlor fireplace. I had gone upstairs with an armful of bags to the room, while Mel was left downstairs trying to convince her mother that she should have brought her hairdryer. When I reached the top of the stairs, I found the air cold, and I immediately stopped to put on the sweater which was around my waist, thinking that someone had left a window open. I picked up the bags again and continued around the corner to face the open door of Mel's room. There, near the window, I saw a woman. she was not white but looked sickly pale, and I called out to her, for what reason, I don't know. She turned to look at me once, and then exited through the window. The window was closed. I was so freaked out that I dropped the bags in the hall and sprinted downstairs, unable to verbalize to anyone what I had just seen.

The next morning, after a restless night, in which I am sure I heard wailing and crying, I was the first awake in the house. Getting dressed, I found myself walking down to the front hall and opening the guest book on the table just inside the front door. In it, I found a description of a murder-suicide, conducted in the late 1800s. A man, who had owned the house, had been pushed out of the east window, by his jealous new wife. The man, it seemed, had been spending time in town with a mistress. The young wife had thrown herself out the window after her beloved, when she realized the full extent of her actions.

Grandfather's Ghost,American Samoa,Family / Friends Visits,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Family / Friends Visits :: Grandfather's Ghost

3 years ago, I was in school at our annual school picnic and my grandpa had been sick with cancer for about 2 years. He's been in 4 different hospitals and wasn't getting any better. The doctors finally told him that they couldn't do anything, so they just sent him home. He lived in my aunt's house for about a month before my dad came and got me and my sister at the picnic, and told me that my grandpa just died. A year later, my dad bought the house from my aunt because she kept hearing noises coming from the room my grandpa died in. Soon after my dad bought it, the noises didn't just come from the room, it started coming from the basement. We started hearing wheezing noises, banging and clanging like someone was looking for something. We moved away now and we never found out what made the noise.

Mavi Kasirgo - Spirit of the Black Cat,"Indiana, United States",Pets / Animals,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Pets / Animals :: Mavi Kasirgo - Spirit of the Black Cat

M avi Kasirgo means Blue Tornadoe in the Turkish language. Mavi was one of my beloved cats, a beautiful black Turkish Ann. But his life was coming to an end: On December 23 2003, he got terribly sick; He got paralyzed, and could only switch his tail around, and therefore couldn't eat. We took him to the vet, and he was diagnosed with a rare case of cancer that was slowly eating his strength away. We had to put him to sleep on Christmas Eve. I tried to make the best of my Christmas, even though Mavi was gone. Or was he?

At about 7:15 PM that Christmas day, I was sitting in the family Sunroom watching television. I happened to glance into the Dinning room, when a flash of light caught my eye. I immediately looked back, and saw an orb of light dancing above the table. It flew into the next room -the kitchen- and disappeared behind a corner for some time, then flew across the kitchen, and into the basement. I thought I was just seeing things, until it happened again the next night at 9:05 PM. I was in bed, just kinda staring at the wall waiting to fall asleep, when something approached me from the stairway. It was the orb again. It swooped around my room for a few minutes, then it went out of my room, and back downstairs, and what I assumed, back into the basement. This time I didn't think I was hallucinating, and I was up all night waiting to see if the orb would come back.

A few weeks later in the month of January 2004, I was browsing through the internet, when I clicked an article about ghosts. Ghosts had always interested me, and I found the time to read it. It turns out that the article was all on ghost orbs, and that many people thought they were angels in this particular form. I then realized that Mavi had been visiting me. Now, I occasionally see him. I've also seen him as an almost transparent apparition of a cat (only once), and I've seen him as nothing; Only the sound of his paws padding across the floor and into the basement when both of my cats are asleep. The most frequent times I see him is in the basement at night in between 7:00 and 9:30 PM in his angel form. I now believe that Mavi is a sort of guardian angel, and appears before me to let me know he is not gone.

Stranger in the Hallway,"California, United States",Apparitions / Voices / Touches,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Apparitions / Voices / Touches :: Stranger in the Hallway

S ince I was small, I have encountered different awkward situations that have no apparent explanations. For instance, I remember in one occasion where I was 5 years of age. I used to live in a 2 room apartment with my family and my grandfather. At that time my father used to work early in the mornings and my mother would wake up to prepare lunch. In one occasion my father had to work even earlier than usual, so he woke up at around 3:00 in the morning. I still remember, my mother was in the kitchen when I woke up to the noise she was doing with the frying pan and the dishes she was using to prepare my father's lunch. I woke up and walked to the kitchen. My mother immediately spotted me and asked me what was I doing up, that it was to early for me and told me to go back to bed. I told her I didn't want to and I wanted to help her out. She smiled at me and said ok. Yet she later said that I couldn't help because I had no shoes on and to just sit down on the carpet. So I sat and waited. I just stared at my mother.

As I was talking to my mother and asking her questions on what she was doing because it smelled good and I was getting hungry. I had this sudden feeling that someone was looking at me while I was sitting there on the carpet, close to the kitchen entrance.  I turned my head to the living room and everything was pitch black. This rush of cold air ran through my body and I decided to just shake it off and I turned back to see my mother, she was almost done and I was glad. Then out of a sudden I felt that same feeling like if someone was looking at me. I turned my head to see again and saw nothing, everything was dark, then with the moonlight I managed to catch a glimpse of something standing by the doorway to the hall that lead to the rooms and the bathroom.  I was little but I knew that wasn't normal. I just saw a shadow. No face no color just a black shadow. Now as I'm writing this, I still can see him clearly. It was the shape of a tall man, I could even distinguished the detail on his clothing, yet nothing had color everything was black.

I rubbed my eyes to make sure I wasn't dreaming or just seeing stuff. Yet, when I open them again he was still there. I just stood there in shock and trying to figure out who he was. I mean, I assumed it was my father, yet I discontinued this idea for the reason that my dad was chunkier than this man. This figure standing in front of me was tall and slender. He seemed to have on some jeans and a t-shirt.  As I was looking at him my mother noticed me looking at something. She then asked me ""what are you doing honey?"" I just stood there noticing this figure kneeling down to reach my height, yet he was still on the opposite side of me. I then responded to my mother that there was this man on the hallway. She was still putting the finishing touches to my fathers lunch so she didn't pay much attention. That dark figure was there, kneeling and staring straight at me. As I stood there looking at him, he started motioning to me to go to him. He stretched his right arm and with his finger, signaled me to go to him. At this moment I was somewhat afraid. It seemed that he was smiling, I couldn't really tell for all of him was dark, but I had this feeling he was. I didn't move and I just shouted back to my mother that this guy was telling me to go to him and that he was scaring me now. By this time my mother said ""who is staring at you honey?"" when I turned around to tell my mother and tell her that in the hall ways someone was there.

It must have been 1 minute or less, I looked back at the doorway and no one was there. My mother also looked at the same time and she was like, ""look there is nothing there"".  She then turns the lights and went to see who was there. For she assumed it was my older brother trying to play tricks on me. She went to the room and my father was finishing getting dressed and she asked him if he was in the hallway. He then told us that he wasn't, he was changing, and then she asked if my brother had left the room. Yet unaware of the situation my dad responded with, that my brother had been sleeping all this time. My mother seemed to have a worried face and then went to my grandfather's door to see if by any chance it had been him. His door was locked and if he would have come out, we all would have heard the door.  Well, it seemed my mother didn't have any reason for what had just happen and told me to cuddle in the bed with her and go to sleep. After that everything was forgotten.

But ever since that day, I have seen more shadows and heard weird noises. I an now 24 and until this day, I usually don't tell anyone on what I see or hear, because they would just brush me off saying ""there you go again with your ghost"".

Winchester Mansion Tour,"California, United States",Ghost Tours & Haunted Hotels,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Ghost Tours & Haunted Hotels :: Winchester Mansion Tour

I took the behind the scenes tour which brought us to the basement of the winchester mansion last march, 2006. I was with a group of 10 or so people. In the room, where the coal bin was, I was in the back of the group standing and just listening to the tour guide. I had my backpack on and my hands on my hips. During the talk, I felt like two ice cold fingers tapping me on the arm and what felt like nudging on my backpack. Strong, yet polite and assertive nudging on my backpack, almost to the point of moving me. It would be like someone was a little annoyed with me that I was in the way, and wanted me to move. I looked back and saw nothing. I remember rubbing my arm where the tapping was to warm the area up and then I stood back in the same position again. Well, it happened again to me, not quite in the same place, but even stronger. Immediately, I thought that this had to be something of a spirit or so. I moved to another spot.

After the tour was done, I told the tour guide about my experience. She told me that there were other guides that experienced what looked like an unclear/grayish/smokish apparition (might not be the right word) or sighting of a gentleman wearing work clothes in the same area. This is the truth and I would appreciate it if others would come forward with their experiences. Thanks.

O ne cold night, as the rain was lashing down my windows and the darkness was upon me, I was laying in my bed. I could not sleep because the rain was so heavy. I lived with only my mother and my father and at the time, I was only 10 years old. I was not sure if it was only my imagination but I started to hear noises, like a man breathing heavily. I though it might have been my imagination and I did not want to go in and wake my parents up. But the noises got worse and the whispering became clear that they he was trying to tell me something! I really began to tremble and the louder it got, the more scared I became. I plucked up the courage to reach for the light as I felt someone holding me back, I turned and glanced at my mirror. I suddenly saw an old man standing behind me! It then disappeared and to this day, I have never seen him again. What did he want from me I will never know!

Visitor in my Bedroom,"Missouri, United States",Apparitions / Voices / Touches,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Apparitions / Voices / Touches :: Visitor in my Bedroom

I had just gotten out of prison a couple of months earlier and had a hard time adjusting to my sleep routine.  I had a full time job at a factory working the day shift.  I would wake up at about 3:00 am every morning, therefore I usually was crashed out by 6 or 7:00 pm every night.  One night, I was laying in bed watching TV.  I was living with my parents at the time.  I was a little scared to be at their house because it is in the country and they have no dusk to dawn light.  I usually slept with the TV on.  I had rolled over to face the wall and go to sleep.  As I layed there, relaxing and almost asleep, nature called. I rolled over to get up and there, in the corner of my room, stood a young man.  To this day I can still tell you what he looked like.  This happened almost 7 years ago.  He stood very still, looking down at the floor.  He had blonde hair, pale complexion.  He wore a navy blue hoodie with pockets in the front (both hands were in the pockets), tan colored pants and dark shoes.  I looked at him for a few seconds and then rolled back over.  My heart was beating fast and once I got the nerve I flew out of my bed and into the living room.  My parents thought I was nuts when I told them the story.  I know what I saw and I know it was real.

Dream of my Great Great Grandfather,"Indiana, United States",Family / Friends Visits,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Family / Friends Visits :: Dream of my Great Great Grandfather

W hen I was a young child, my mother hung a couple of really old pictures in my room.  They were of my great great grandparents (in the Civil War era).  My great great grandfather was in his Civil War garb.  Later that night, I ""dreamed"", or so I THINK it was a dream, that I encountered the ghost of my great great grandfather.  I was walking through the house and was overcome by an enormous chill that sent me to my knees along with a feeling of fear.  Then an apparition of my great great grandfather appeared. After the fear had passed, I remember just having a conversation with him.  I don't remember the specifics of the conversation, only that his name was Caleb.  When I woke in the morning, I told my mother about the dream. Upon telling her about the dream and what had happened, she, in turn, turned white as a sheet because as it turns out, Caleb WAS INDEED my great great grandfather's name.

Held Down on Bed,Australia,Old Hags / Night Attacks / Sleep Paralysis,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Old Hags / Night Attacks / Sleep Paralysis :: Held Down on Bed

L ast night when I was sleeping, I thought I was having a dream, but now I'm not so sure, it felt so real. It was like I was above myself. I was laying on my bed and I was being held down by my wrists and ankles, something very heavy was on me top of me. I tried to move and I tried to yell but I couldn't. Then, just as I woke up, it was gone and I felt very strange and could hardly breath. I stayed awake for hours thinking what was it. Can anyone please help me and try and explain it to me. Also my cat always sleeps  on my bed, but he wouldn't come in the room and slept in the lounge room.

My House is Haunted,"Illinois, United States",Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: My House is Haunted

I have been living in this house for 6 years now and when I first moved here I was 6. Ever since we lived there, I always saw shadows. I told my parents and they said they have been seeing them too so they asked the people who used to live there if they knew anything about this. They said an old man lived and died there. So we blessed the house but I still see shadows. Once I was in the kitchen and my little sister screamed and I asked what happened and she said her pony flew across the other side of the room. The day before yesterday, I was playing PS2 and I saw an old man looking at me from the doorway. I still see things, even from outside. Yesterday, I saw a man outside my window running around my backyard wearing all white.

White Lady Trespassing,Portugal,Apparitions / Voices / Touches,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Apparitions / Voices / Touches :: White Lady Trespassing

A few months ago, I was in my bed in early morning, the door was closed, and suddenly a white shape, in form of a woman, passed through the door and floated toward me, trespassing my body, soul and senses. I am very disturbed by that, if someone can help explaining me what it is? It happened at a time when me and other friends had played ""spirits in a glass"" (a form of ouija), so I think that's a probable cause, but that encounter really affected me.

Haunted House in Maine,"Maine, United States",Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: Haunted House in Maine

O nce I lived in this house in a small town in Maine, it was an older house. I do not know any history behind it and I most likely never will, but it was an older house. We had a basement and 4 rooms, the usual old house style. The kitchen is where most of the ""abnormal"" activities would take place.

Our front door had an entrance, with another door, a heavy wooden door with glass window. The way the door sat, you would have to push hard to open it and then you would be in a small porch type which led to the front door. Quite often the front door would swing open but yet the outside door would remain closed.

You could sit in the living room and watch our kitchen light turn on and off. The kitchen light we had was old fashioned, it had a florescent bulb with a metal pull string. Once you pulled the string, it came on. Well, my mom put a piece of yarn on to the metal string so us kids could reach it. You could actually watch that string being pulled. This happened every night and we got use to it very quickly.

I have always assumed that the presence was an old lady and so did my family. We have no idea why we just felt that. Us kids would go to bed with our windows open and blankets off, because in the middle of summer it gets hot. We would wake up our windows closed and bundled up in blankets. Now we had talked to my parents about it often and they said we were at that age so they didn't even need to check on us. We were never frightened by any of this, it all became normal even to our friends. But one day, and I will never forget any of this, my mom went to go turn on the kitchen light with the yarn on the end of it. She went to turn it on and she was shocked so bad it dropped her to her knees. Now I really am not sure but I am almost positive that you can not get electrocuted by yarn.

Awhile after that, we moved. We just figured that she liked to play with us, it seemed like she liked to tease us.

Haunting from a Stranger or Family Member?,Canada,Family / Friends Visits,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Family / Friends Visits :: Haunting from a Stranger or Family Member?

I have so many stories to tell in here. Let's start with when it first happened. Me and my family have this clock, it's not a grandfather clock, but it has a pendulum and it hangs up on the wall and for years the pendulum didn't move, however the clock part of it worked. One day the batteries died, so we took them out, a couple of weeks later this random white feather just floated down from out of no where and since my mom's uncle died, she thought it was him, so she kissed the feather and about 2 seconds after she did that, the pendulum on the clock started moving. Now may I remind you that the clock at the time still had no batteries in it... coincidence? I think not, because this happened a couple of times too and the same thing happened - mom kissed the feather and 2 seconds later the pendulum starts moving and everyone gets freaked out.

Another story happened when I was home alone, I was at the computer, the t.v. was on and all of sudden it just turned off. I thought maybe it was my dog that did it because sometimes he sits on the converter and turns it off, but no, I looked beside me and the converter was right there. Another time, when I walked past the t.v. it turned off, at this point I am officially believing we have a ghost in our house, and I'm not even done with the stories yet.

This happened when I was home alone. You know how animals can see paranormal stuff? Well my dog, one time, when I let him in ran to the middle of the family room, started barking at what looked to me as air but I definitely know that he was barking at something. I believe it's a ghost, but if I tell other people, they get all scared, like I'm just telling them a scary story that isn't true. None of my family believe me and think I'm ""overreacting"", I pretty sure things have happened to them, but they just don't want to say it.

Here's another story. I have a web cam, me and my friends were going to take pictures on it and I noticed this picture of nothing. Now at first, I didn't think anything of it, but then I looked at it again and it shows the date of when it was taken and it says last 2:30 a.m. 2006. It was taken on a thursday and I'm pretty sure I was already in bed, so as I looked closely at the picture, I still can't figure it out. Of course I deleted it.

By this time, I'm certain now there's a ghost in my house, and there are a lot more stories, but my fingers hurt from typing, so I'm going to stop. Either I have a ghost in my house, or it's just a ""dead"" relative that was visiting. I'll never know...

Once Hit,"Arkansas, United States",Orbs / Lights / Mists,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Orbs / Lights / Mists :: Once Hit

T his happened just last night. It started at around 8:00 or 8:30 pm, my other half had just dozed off and started snoring while laying on the couch asleep. My 13 years old son and I had just began watching a show called The Hallow. All a sudden, we began hearing knocks that were like someone hitting wood, by spacing the knocks about two to three seconds apart. We both jumped and looked at each other and started laughing. About five minutes later, talking it over, we returned to watching our movie.

After about fifteen minutes, I felt the urge to go to restroom. I took care of my business and upon returning to the living room, suddenly, we heard a noise from behind me in the bathroom, where I had just came from. My son just looked at me so seriously and said ""just think you were in there with that!"". Of course, after checking that out and finding nothing, I felt loads of cold chills.

About an hour later, I was returning to scene of crime. I just got out of my chair, made a quick left to return to the bathroom, when my son let out a drawn out ""oooooohoh"", I quickly turned back around to see what was happening, when he asked ""did you see that?"". I asked what he saw and he describes a fluorescent orb, the size of a softball. Later, I see a smaller one, the size of about a quarter, with a tail streaming behind it. This all went on about four hours, than just stopped as suddenly as it started.

The reason I called this once hit is about three months ago, my son was sleeping on the couch, when he comes running to our room saying ""mom! come here now!"". He said he had covered his head because of noises and was suddenly hit really hard on the arm and had the sudden bruise to prove it.

The Unknown Presence,"Illinois, United States",Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: The Unknown Presence

G etting home from my cousin's house, I went straight to my room to talk on the phone. I was cleaning out my closet when I felt this weird presence. So I turned around and I found one of my collectibles, my little pony dolls, floating up in the air. Then it floated across the room and smashes itself into my wall. I was so surprised that I ran downstairs screaming to my dad.

A couple of months went by without having any repeats of that incident. But all of a sudden, every night starting from 11:00pm to 3:00am, I start hearing these weird noises. I hear footsteps going up and down the stairs. Then it starts running and it sounds like it crashes into something. Because all you hear is a big thud. I'll be in my room changing the voicemail on my cell phone and when I replay it, I can hear voices in the background trying to talk to me, telling me to get out of their house. Later on, me and my cousin got out of school early and went to my house to eat. So we were up in my room, when we heard someone open the door downstairs and walk up the stairs. Since I have a dog, it started freaking out for no reason. It started barking a lot but its barks sounded like if it was crying of fear. Then it yelped as if someone had hit it. The footsteps reached my door and started trying to get into my room but couldn't because my door was locked. All me and my cousin saw was my door handle moving around. Then we heard this low eary whistle. When my cousin used her cell phone to call her boyfriend to come pick us up, while the call was connecting, a voice showed up telling us to leave now out of their house. So we just hung up. The house got really cold even though the heater was on. We called her boyfriend again and when he answered, we asked him to come pick us up. When he did, we both went running down the stairs. We passed a room and my cat was in there with his tail all puffed up. We tried getting out of my house but the door wouldn't open. Finally it opened and we left.

So far, there are still weird noises. We are in the process of getting our house blessed, hoping that this unwanted presence finally leaves our house.

Voices in a Plane,Canada,Apparitions / Voices / Touches,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Apparitions / Voices / Touches :: Voices in a Plane

I work at air canada and I am a groomer, I spend a lot of time in planes and I have never experienced something like this. I was in a plane alone, the last person had gone out for a break so I was left alone, it was late at night and I was tired, and I had this feeling that I was being watched so I kept on turning around to look but there was never anything there until I heard a faint noise, it was a kind of whisper and it was calling my name. It couldn't have been one of the groomers because I heard the last one leave and if someone were to come in, I would have heard the door.  I thought I was imagining things so I just kept working, but I kept on hearing the whisper and it was getting louder and louder and that feeling of being watched never left me so I just ran out of the plane in terror.

The next day I told some of my friends about it (they were also groomers) and they said they had that same feeling on the same plane and that things were moving around when they weren't looking, it was really scary, but they got the plane blessed for safety reasons in case anything like that happened in the air. I will never forget that night.

An Imaginary Friend,"Pennsylvania, United States",Family / Friends Visits,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Family / Friends Visits :: An Imaginary Friend

W hen I was a little girl, I had an imaginary friend, like most little kids do. I called her Gena. We would play together and such. My mother never thought anything about it, as her friends children had them too. But as I got into kindergarten and started getting more friends, I decided I didn't need her anymore. I remember telling her to leave... but she wouldn't. I would get so upset and tell my mother. My mom told me to tell her to leave and if she wouldn't she would come up herself and tell her to leave. I went upstairs to tell her (I don't remember what I said exactly)... but I knew she didn't leave. My mom came upstairs and told her to leave, but I told her she didn't. My mom just tucked me into bed and told me we would do it again tomorrow. She bugged me the whole night keeping me up.. I was so angry. Finally after I ignored her she left. I was very happy and relieved.

When I turned 18, I flew over to England to see my Grandmother and other family. I was looking through one of my Aunts old family albums and came across this picture of this little girl. She looked familiar, like I had seen her before. I asked my Aunt who she was and she told me it was her cousin, who had died at the age of only 8. I asked of her name and she said Eugena. I was startled! I told her of the imaginary friend I had and how I called her Gena. My family is very spiritual and she said it was probably her cousin visiting with me.

When I returned to the states, I told my sister. I didn't live with her when I was little because she lived with her father. She said she had one and she called her GG. I also told my cousin and she had one who she called Eu(u). We believe it was the same little girl who just wanted to meet us and play with us. We don't think of it as a bad thing, when we think back, we realize it was a family member who just wanted to meet us.

Children & Spirits,"Pennsylvania, United States",Children Who See Spirits,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Children Who See Spirits :: Children & Spirits

M y daughter just turned 3 last week. I think she sees spirits. At night, when I put her in her crib, she will start talking. Like she is speaking to someone. And during the day, while she is in her play-pen, she will spin around with her hands up in the air just giggling the whole time. It has just recently started to scare me because one day, my husband, my daughter, my new born son and I were in the living room watching finding nemo and my daughter runs back in the hallway. I go after her, not wanting her to go into the bathroom and mess around. She stops in the middle of the hallway and screams and turns around running straight for me. I asked her what she saw and she makes this mad face. My husband and I believe that our house is haunted and that my daughter talks and sees spirits. I know she will grow out of it... but I'm just nervous about my son.

Jerry IV,"Colorado, United States",Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: Jerry IV

I 've had many weird encounters in my life, the strangest of which has been with this annoying ghost that I've nicknamed Jerry... Hallucinations, premonitions, nightmares, all of them have been caused by him. Most of these times I have ignored him and done nothing about it. I'm not sure exactly WHAT to do about it either... Here I am going to describe two separate events that have happened in the past two weeks.

I slipped down the stairs silently, unwilling to let myself be heard after being out so late... The light switch beckoned me, but I did not turn it on for fear of being found out... If you've read the description of my basement in my other stories , you'll understand this better. The hallway on my right, which led down to the bathroom and laundry room, was always lit. The light shone down toward me, as I was in the never-lit area, with the exception of a night light. Twice, I've seen Jerry's shadow extending toward me from down that hall, and when I go down there to confront him, there isn't anyone there. It's a small room, just the washer and drier, and the bathroom on the right, and it's very small. However there is a secret compartment there, which once contained something I'd lost... A flashlight, which I always kept by my bed, and never took anywhere unless there was a power outage... One night I lost it, and found it in that secret compartment. How the hell did it get there?! Gee... I wonder.

At any rate, when I got into the bathroom and looked into the mirror, I happened to catch a glimpse of a figure hurrying out the door behind me, and I had seen no one when I entered (I only saw his reflection in the mirror)... I quickly turned, but nobody was there either! I ran back down the hall, and detected no other presence. But then I looked at my TV. A moment ago, ""America's Most Wanted"" was on. But all of a sudden the screen displayed this big, ugly, bloody face that stared at me with these small, black eyes... Then suddenly it went to static, and switched back to the show. Ok Jerry, you've made your point! You are indeed annoying! But no, he wasn't done yet! How did I piss him off this time? I guess I was invading his space... Or rather MY space, which I never once welcomed him into. As soon as I turned around, there was his shadow, casting down at me from the end of the hall! He quickly turned and moved off to the left, where the only means of escape was a heat duct. I raced down there to find... nothing.

This next time happened in the past week. I was on the phone with one of my friends (the only person I know who I've been brave enough to talk about this with), and it just had to happen. As she's talking, suddenly I hear the upstairs phone get picked up. Through the phone, suddenly the sound of Jerry's cough blasts into my ears. ""Ghuuuuuhaaaaa, ghuuuuhaaa.........."" I just about screamed. And the scariest part -- Stephanie didn't even hear it. I was on the verge of saying something, but I held back, because she didn't say a word. Whether or not she believed it was ME or if she heard it at all, I cannot determine... As it was the cordless phone, I immediately rushed upstairs and glared into the room. My cat was sitting peacefully on the chair, sleeping. ""Is somebody else there?"" I asked. ""Um... No?"" Stephanie replied. Crap, am I really going insane?!

Last but not least I finally left another sheet of paper and a pen in the secret compartment in my bathroom, hoping to get a reply from Jerry. I wrote out, ""I want answers! Write on the line below and get back to me! Either answer me or get the [heck] outta my house!"" But the most response I got was a funny pattern of dots on the line. It isn't much of a pattern, but I know I sure didn't draw it. In tracking down this ghost I have found certain SMALL possessions of mine missing or in a different place. My mom loses things all the time. Often I wonder if that's because of Jerry. I still have yet to prove the existence of Jerry to anyone. I feel like I've tried it all... I don't want to call in a ghost expert and end up disappointed... I know what I see, and what I have seen, and I cannot deny Jerry's existence in my house. I also have yet to confirm his real name, or who the hell he even is. What I've thought of trying: Use my video camera and try to catch him on film, or use a tape recorder and try to get any trace of an abnormality in the sound waves... Although I have never heard Jerry speak (he coughs and sneezes, that's not speaking), I believe he has a sort of intelligence, and is DEFINITELY messing with me. I have no way of knowing what his tricks will build up to one day, but I only hope its something I can use as proof for someone who can do something... anything... about it. I've even tried to have a sense of humor with Jerry sometimes! I've tried to joke around with him, but he must not hear me 'cause I'm a real funny guy (no). Next time anything comes up, I'm going to TRY to get some sort of evidence if I can...

I only hope I can be rid of Jerry one day, because he's not scary, he's not ""Interesting"", he's annoying, and he gets on my last nerve. Because of him I have no fear of ghosts. They just annoy me now.

I Have a Ghost in my House,"California, United States",Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: I Have a Ghost in my House

M y husband and I have been in our house for 8 months now, and we have a ghost; or at least we are convinced we do. I am a skeptical person and do not believe in these sort of things, but now I am starting to. It seems to be happening to my husband more than me.

There have been a few times where I've come home from shopping and when I come inside he had thought that I was already home because he said he heard the door shut earlier, but it's never me. A few weekends ago I was out with my girlfriends and as he was asleep he heard me come in and go into the front bathroom and vomit. He got up to bring me a glass of water in the bathroom.... but I wasn't home. I too come home and find that lights are on that I shut off, a chair will be pushed out or the toilet paper in the bathroom will be rolled down to the floor. Last night my husband woke up because he felt something kick him in his back from under the mattress. He thought perhaps our dog was under the bed, but he was asleep at the foot of our bed.

I never hear voices and I've never seen a ghost, but I am so afraid of my house now. No one ever died there, there was only a couple who lived there for 20 years and now us. What should I do?

Demons Among Us,"Illinois, United States",Demons / Possessions / Exorcisms,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Demons / Possessions / Exorcisms :: Demons Among Us

W hen I was 17 years old, I was attacked by an evil spirit, or, as some call them, demons. Me and my family lived in a three bedroom home, in Danville Ill. One day, when I got home around 5:30 pm from work, my mom was still cooking dinner and I walked up to her saying Hi and looked at what she was cooking. I gave her a kiss and then I went to my room to listen to some music, because dinner wasn't ready. I clayed down on my bed and put on my headphones. I heard the DJ talking, and he put on the Beatles. As the song took off, all was fine, the song was on like I've heard it before, but this time, something went all wrong.

As I heard the song, a person spoke to me. He said ""Satan Satan Satan"". I also heard like crickets in the background and I could still hear the song, but faintly. As soon as I heard that, I said ""No No No"" out loud. I went to get up, as I sat up on my bed, a hand grabbed me and pushed me down, that thing was strangling me, I could feel his fingers on me. I also felt his legs and him sitting on my waist. I grabbed his arm, but couldn't see anything, just a hole around my hands, it felt like an arm and like he had warts. My room got cold, like 30 below zero, and smelled sulphur. I tried to get him off me but couldn't. When I knew that evil spirit would kill me, I tried to pray but couldn't say a word, because he was squeezing. That's when I said, in my mind, ""God have mercy on me, I'll change, I'll be good!"", and as soon I said that, it was gone.  If I had not called on God's help, I would had died that day.

My Cat's Ghost,"Wisconsin, United States",Pets / Animals,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Pets / Animals :: My Cat's Ghost

I was sleeping in my bed one night, and all of a sudden, I woke up and could not move. My 2 year old cat died about 6 months ago, she had a heart attack on the living room floor. While I was sleeping, I woke up and I felt like she was crawling on my bed, just like she used to do when she was alive. At first, I felt really comforted, because I miss her so much, and it was nice to feel her presence. Then it felt as if she had crawled right next to me and curled up leaning against me. She used to do that when she was alive. I was so scared I couldn't move. I had this weird, nervous feeling, and was completely paralyzed. I wanted to turn around so badly to see if it was her ghost, but I didn't know what to expect and couldn't move. Every once in a while, it feels like she is crawling on my bed, just like she used to, but that was the only time where I really believed her spirit was definitely with me.

What do you think? Was it sleep paralysis? Or was my cat trying to visit me?

Oak Island,Canada,Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: Oak Island

T his story took place at the Oak Island hotel. I was staying there for March Break with my family. It happened when I was swimming and the water started to bubble. I went under and saw someone. I was terrified. They say people haunt that hotel and the Island but I guess I never really thought about it. When I was trying to buy something from the vending machine, all my money came back out and I tried to do it without money and it worked, so I didn't have to pay. At night, I saw someone in front of my curtain in my hotel room and I was terrified. I have seen a lot of things happen at that hotel and around it, but I guess I never thought I would notice anything like a ghost. I have never heard of anyone being killed there, and hopefully not. I am going back this March Break with my family and a friend and I can't wait to witness more surprises.

First Real Fright,"Maryland, United States",Apparitions / Voices / Touches,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Apparitions / Voices / Touches :: First Real Fright

I was only about 4 or 5 when this happened. My mom had tucked me into bed and went back down to the basement where they were fixing it up a bit. I believe they were putting carpet down that day. I'm almost asleep when I feel a hand rest on my shoulder. I turn around expecting to see one of my parents... but nothing. I look down at the floor to see if my dog may have touched my shoulder with his nose then layed down, but to my horror... I was the only one (that I could see) in my room.

I jumped out of my bed and ran down to the basement as fast as my little body could make itself go. I went down to find my parents and dog down there. When I asked if anyone was in my room and touched my shoulder, they said no, took me back upstairs to tuck me in. They said it must have been my imagination.

We moved from that house about 5 or 6 years ago. In the new house, I almost always have the feeling of being watched. I see things move out of the corner of my eye. I also hear footsteps every now and then. I sense someone, or thing, with me when I'm almost positive that I'm alone.

Two to three years ago, I'd hear very faint laughing every once in a good while. Also about a year ago, when I was trying to get to sleep, I felt a cool breeze (or breath?) on my face. I also tend to see faint or quick glances of shadows that are there, then they're not.

The Curly Haired Man with Sunglasses,"Massachusetts, United States",Apparitions / Voices / Touches,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Apparitions / Voices / Touches :: The Curly Haired Man with Sunglasses

W hen I was 10 years old, I was at a family party at my aunt's house, just a few streets away from my house. A few of my close cousins and I walked back to my house to escape our crazy aunts and annoying little cousins. When we turned onto our street, my cousin said to me ""Is your dad home?"" ""No,"" I replied. ""Oh, I thought I saw him sitting on the bench in your front yard a second ago but he's gone now. he had dark curly hair and and big sunglasses."" When we all got inside my house we sat down and ate ice cream sandwiches to cool off the hot summer day. ""I swear I just saw that guy again on your front steps but he's gone now!"" my cousin said to me. Everyone just brushed it off and went upstairs to my room.

As we sat and talked, we began to hear loud, distinct footsteps walking up and down the stairs. Terrified, I began flipping through the pages of the many books I had on ghosts and witchcraft, etc. After about an hour of reading useless information and waiting for the noises to cease, we worked up the courage to venture back down stairs. Clutching crucifixes and wearing rosary beads around our necks, we crept slowly down the stairs into the sun-lit house. Nothing was there. There was no more noise. We threw open the front door and ran back to my aunt's house, not realizing we forgot to close the door behind us. While we were walking back to the party, a crimson red truck drove by us with it's driver side window open. The man inside had dark curly hair and big sunglasses. He slowly waved at us and drove off. We never saw this man again.

When we got back to my aunt's house, we told everyone the story. No one believed us. Our parents thought that someone had broken into our house and we should have been more responsible and taken the liberty to call someone. We all vowed never to talk about it again, more out of embarrassment than fear.

A few months later, my neighbors and best friends were having a sleep over when they saw a man with dark curly hair and big sunglasses in their window on the second floor. When I heard the story I told them about my experience.

Now, five years later, we have come to terms with our ghostly encounter and we talk about it in humor. But none of us would dare bring it up with our parents for fear of what they would say. The look our parents had on their faces that day could have scared the devil. The worry in their voices was unlike we had ever heard before.  Could there be more to the story of the man with the dark curly hair and the big sun glasses? Do our parents know something that we don't? I guess I'll never know...

My Boyfriend Was Attacked by a Demon,"Wisconsin, United States",Demons / Possessions / Exorcisms,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Demons / Possessions / Exorcisms :: My Boyfriend Was Attacked by a Demon

T his is my ex-boyfriend's story. The same story that got me interested in the other world. I wasn't there when this happened, but here is the story he told me;

Apparently, one night while he was laying in his bed, not quite asleep yet, he felt as if a hand were going through his chest, and grabbing onto his heart trying to stop it. It was squeezing his heart so tight, he could barely breathe. He tried screaming for help, but no one else was home. No one outside the house could hear him either. At least, no one helped him if they could. Then, whatever it was lifted him up off the bed and then slammed him down. It did this a few times. When his sister finally came home, it stopped. This happened a few times in that house. He lives in an apartment now, and nothing has happened as of yet.  He also said that every once in a while at that house, he would feel as if something grabbed a hold of his arm and banged it against the table. He had no control over it.

I have racked my brain to figure out what this could have been, especially since at the time when he told me the story, I was such a skeptic. Any feedback would be greatly appreciated.

Old Man in the House,India,Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: Old Man in the House

I live and work in Dubai, United Arab Emirates.  But this took place in Goa, India, where I went down for a vacation with my 2 daughters, my younger sister and her boyfriend.  It was July 2006, when we have the rainy season in India.  We left from Mumbai at 5:30am in the morning and by the time we reached Goa, it was about 4:00pm,  we were to live in my sister's boyfriend newly purchased house, which they used for vacation purposes only, which meant the house stood empty most of the time.  After much cleaning of the house, we went to a nearby restaurant for dinner.  By the time we got home, we were all so exhausted from the traveling and cleaning, that everybody fell asleep as soon as they put their heads on the pillow.

In the middle of the night, I was woken up by someone stroking my hair. I got up and looked at my sister and her boyfriend, because he was naughty and always up to mischief, but they both were fast asleep. I laid down again and tried to close my eyes, and again I felt someone touch my head, in a very loving manner. I freaked out and slept (or stayed awake) the remainder of the night near my sister and her boyfriend's feet.

The next afternoon I told my sister and her boyfriend about this and she told me that she felt a presence in the bathroom when she was bathing, it was as if someone was watching her.  This watched over feeling was very strong in the kitchen and bathroom.  I never felt threatened by it, but I did not like the ""being watched over"" feeling, especially in the bathroom. My sister's boyfriend got really freaked and would not go to the toilet or bathroom without my sister.  We stayed there for 4 nights, but I never slept even for 1 night.  The last night we were there, I actually saw a shadow peering at us from the kitchen.  Maybe it was just saying goodbye.  My sister and I always felt this entity was a male, and a old one too.

The Unloved One,Zambia,Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: The Unloved One

I n 1989 I used to live in a huge house that had four stories to it and it had ten rooms in it. One night, after my twentieth birthday, we were cleaning up after most of the guests were gone.  I really had to go and change my white dress, so I went to my room and there, on my bed, sat a young man of about twenty two years of age. His eyes were very sad and he had a letter in his hand.  I got scared but I couldn't scream so he got up and walked up to me like he knew me. He had really blue eyes and he was pale. He showed me the letter he was holding and it had my name in it, but it was written about twenty years earlier.  I got really scared and opened my mouth to speak, but then he said ""I thought you loved me?  Why did you have to write to a man that left you and got married to another woman.?""  Then he walked right through the wall into the next room.  That's when I could move and talk, but I was so shocked at what happened and I was sure that no one would believe me.

So I did some research on the history on the house. I found out that the lady was named Tammy and she rejected the hand of Jack Lewis. He loved her very much but she never gave him the chance to show her how much love he had for her. After that day, he came to me every night to tell me how much he loved me. I don't get scared anymore and I fall asleep to his voice.  Now I am married to a Jack Larry and he looks exactly like the ghost. Now he doesn't come to me anymore.

Good Friday,"New York, United States",Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: Good Friday

I was around 10 years old. It was good Friday in Brooklyn NY and my mother woke up, listening to music. My mother went in to take a shower and right there, I felt a little nervous. Why? I don't know. I was sitting on the sofa and heard footsteps thinking it was my mother. I didn't bother to turn around. Since it took her a while to pass me, since she had to pass me to get to her room, I turned to see what she was doing. She wasn't there. I went to the bathroom and she was still taking a shower. When she got out I told her and she said ""that's scary, I saw a tall shadow through the curtain!"". Right there I just wanted to hurry and go to my aunt's house. While she was doing her hair, singing along with the radio, we heard the front door open and slam, and we heard a man say ""that's freaking nice, keep singing!"" We both went to the door because, at this time, I was really scared and didn't want to be nowhere in the house alone. When we went towards the door we saw a shadow coming towards us. I closed my eyes and grabbed my mom and right there, a cold wind went right by us.

Since that day, on I would beg my mother to let me stay in my aunt's house, because the weird things did not stop there. We would always see shadows, and every now and then, something would say something when we would have music on or if the TV was a little louder than usual.

The Moaning,United Kingdom,Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: The Moaning

F or the past 10 years I have lived in St. Anns in Nottingham, England. Our area is called Stonebridge Park. I may have lived here for 10 years, but this ghost story has only been happening for the past 2 & half years. The street I live on is directly next to Nottingham's famous Stonebridge City Farm. Between our street and the farm is a public pathway that the locals call 'The Farm Pathway'. This pathway runs right through the farm land and is a public access way to other housing estates. Well, it is on this pathway that the 'Wailing Woman' is heard.

To be honest, when it first started in Summer 2004, we actually thought it was a crazy person going around, but we soon discovered it wasn't. The latest encounter was in the early hours of 11th January 2007 at 3:25AM. She is heard in 2 different ways. The most common heard is that of this woman shouting for help, crying out in desperation. Sometimes a man's voice accompanies hers, but the male voice is always much quieter. The other way she is heard is much more disturbing. Her pitiful moans of anguish and pain echo through the air, shattering the night silence.

The second time we ever heard it, in 2004, me and my dad looked out of our bathroom window, which overlooks the path. The woman's cries for help were so close, coming from the path, we expected to be able to see her but nothing was there, yet the cries continued! Half hour later the police arrived - someone had obviously called after hearing cries for help. The police concluded that the caller was a hoaxer, but we insisted the cries were there and that we had heard them! The exact same cries started a couple weeks later and me and dad went around to the farm path to see who it was. But as with before, the sound continued but no visible person was around.

The cries once again just stopped dead. It was over a year and we had forgotten all about the cries for help. But it was in Summer 2005 that it started up again, at exactly the same time as the previous year! It was then that me and dad concluded and believed that these cries were some sort of residual haunting. The fact that the voice was always the same, always said the same things and that no visible person was ever present is what led us to believe this. Another thing we noticed is that about 95% of the time, the sound only occurred on Friday and Saturday nights.

It was another great amount of time before we heard the 'Wailing Woman' again. This time it was different. Her cries of pain, anguish and heart break echo through the night. I must say this - It is VERY disturbing to hear, especially in the middle of the night. What is odd is that, despite the sounds being different, you can tell it is the same woman who is calling for help. Anyway, coming back to the present. These cries started again at 3:25AM on the 11th January 2007. It was only last week that the cries for help were heard and now we have the moaning.

Is the moaning the spirit of the woman, actually haunting the pathway? It is my own theory that this woman was murdered by her husband / lover. If this is true, then it is sad as her long departed ghost seems to still be suffering...

Playful Ghost,"New York, United States",Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: Playful Ghost

I 've been living in this house for about four years and just recently, there has been evidences of a ghost. I'm not sure if it is friendly or not though. But there's the usual stuff happening, like footsteps. It usually happens upstairs, when no one else is even up there. And the radio station changes in the bathroom when someone is taking a shower. Then, there are the unusual presences like feeling someone is in the room with you, when you're the only one. It seems to me like I'm the only one who experiences that though... maybe I'm just crazy. Also, it feels like the only two rooms where this is happening is my room and my older sister's. Especially my older sister's. Her room is the most ""active"". That's where it is colder then the rest of the house and shadows sometimes move when no one is in the room. My room is where the presences happen though.

I don't know why this has just started happening but to me it seems either playful or it's trying to scare us purposefully. In the kitchen, there are two cupboards lined up along side each other and one of them has all of the salad plates on a smaller shelf and the bigger plates underneath it. The shelf that the smaller plates are on is sturdy in there and wouldn't tip unless someone pushed it. This morning all of the salad plates fell out of the cupboard and only one of them breaks. The shelf is still in there and so are all of the other plates. The only way that could have happened is if someone pushed the plates down, even then, I don't know how only one of the plates broke.

Presence in my Room,"New York, United States",Old Hags / Night Attacks / Sleep Paralysis,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Old Hags / Night Attacks / Sleep Paralysis :: Presence in my Room

S ince I was a kid, I've had weird visions and encounters. My parents always listened, but I was never scared so they were never overly concerned. Though my mother always believed me, I think she chalked it up to my creative nature. As I got older, I noticed more and more, specifically at night. Regardless of what house or apartment I'm in, I've noticed a presence between 2:00am-3:00am on a recurring basis - multiple times at exactly 2:15am. Often its just seeing or feeling someone in the room. A couple times, I've woken up because I felt someone rip my blankets off me or had this feeling of someone watching me. But all in all though, it's been alarming, sometimes annoying, yet it's always felt playful and I've never felt any real fear.

I've been living in my apartment for almost 3 years, alone. You hear a lot in an old building and I always think I see things...

But last night I fell asleep around 1:00am. I was sleeping on my stomach and felt something pushing my head into my pillow - trying to smother me. My first thought was this was really happening and I went into defense mode.  Though I had amazing resistance - like I couldn't control my body - I moved my arm between face and pillow, reached back to what was pushing me and yelled ""STOP!"".

There was of course nothing there, but as I yelled, ""they"" let go of my head and tried to push me off my bed. I felt like I reached the edge and jumped up, turned on my lights and looked around. It was exactly 2:11am. At that exact moment I yelled ""leave me alone!"" and my iPod went on. As I secured my room, I noticed my bedroom door was closed, but not shut as I had left it the night before. I walked through my apartment and came back to my room and tried to go back to sleep. A little uneasy to say the least.

Do you think this will be a one time event? will it escalate? Or should I take some sort of action against this spirit?

Grandmother's Prediction,"California, United States",Family / Friends Visits,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Family / Friends Visits :: Grandmother's Prediction

M y grandmother passed away 12 years ago and I think she predicted her own death. Here's the story: My grandmother's health was deteriorating and she was bed ridden for about 2 years. I was sleeping over that night and she kept a mattress in her closet which I went to get. When I entered her room, I felt a strange feeling, like something wasn't right. Then my grandmother asked me ""Why are you being so rude, why don't you give these people a drink."" ""The people"" she was referring to were family members of ours that had already passed. That night she also said she was going to leave with them. I didn't believe her and neither did everybody else. We just thought she was going senile, but the next morning we found her dead in her bed.

Later that morning, my mother picked me up from her house to bring me back home.  I fell asleep in my bedroom and my younger brother was asleep on the couch in the living room.  Well, I was fast asleep and I experienced what I know now is sleep paralysis.  It felt like I couldn't move or speak out and my body felt like there was a heavy weight on it.  I believe that it was my grandmother visiting me to say good bye.  I just want to know if it's possible that my grandmother knew that she was leaving and also was it her that caused my sleep paralysis.  I'm really looking for comments and opinions.

The Woods,"New York, United States",Misc,"T his encounter isn't like the most recent one , actually it's not very recent either. Last February, my friend moved to Vermont. During the summer she invited me there and her mom suggested to go on a hike to Hamilton Falls. It was  Rose (my friend), her mom, her mom's boyfriend, his next door neighbor, his son and me. Rose and I went ahead of the others. We got about a mile ahead of them when we started getting strange feeling like someone was following us. But it obviously wasn't the other people because they were too far behind us. We then heard branches snapping and footsteps close behind us and a little bit off the path. It also wasn't animals because it seemed that there weren't any around. As we continued walking we started getting REALLY odd feelings and we actually started talking to these unseen presences, if they actually were spirits that is. And mind you, we have NEVER taken drugs and we weren't drunk. We kept walking and the feelings got stronger until we had to take a rest on some rocks.

Eventually it got a tad bit better and we continued up the path until we came to a sign that marked to falls. We followed the steps until they came to an end and we didn't know which way to go after that so we went straight down. We came to a pool of water that obviously wasn't the waterfall. We heard Rose's mom's boyfriend calling and we raced back up the hill. He asked where we went and we told him that we couldn't find the rest of the path. He then showed us a very clearly marked path that we could've sworn wasn't there when we first started off.

We stayed at the falls for about half an hour and decided it was time to leave since it would be getting dark soon. Rose and I once again went ahead of the others and we started to get those odd feelings again. And to add to the creepyness, it was dusk. We were basically running back to the car. We slowed down a bit and Rose was getting really freaked. She said she felt like she wasn't really walking beside me but it seemed like there was a wall between us and she could only faintly hear me but it was muffled. Then I looked behind me to see two figures following us. I could tell one of them was Dave's (boyfriend) next door neighbor with his son of his shoulders... the other just looked like the silhouette of a human figure. I thought that it must have been Rose's mom or Dave but I didn't know why they would have left the other behind. Dave's neighbor caught up to us and I asked him where the other two were. He said that they stopped for a break. I looked back over my shoulder and realized that if they had stopped they wouldn't be able to catch up to us in about 5 minutes. The figure was still there, walking at the same rating as before.

Rose by then was seriously having a panic attack. But then, there was a loud snapping on the little piece of land, by the water. I looked up to see a rather large white dog running along the water. I told Rose and Dave's neighbor and they both saw it. It wasn't as big as a greyhound but almost. The thing is I could only hear it when it was about 7 feet away and see it when it was 5 feet away. Same with when it was behind us. Later, we were waiting by the fence to get into the hiking area for about 20 minutes for Rose's mom and Dave. We went back to the car and headed back. Rose asked her mom if she and Dave saw the dog but they both asked us what dog. It was too big to not see and a big white dog in the middle of the woods at 10p:00m is also pretty noticeable.

Christmas Eve Ghost,"Pennsylvania, United States",Apparitions / Voices / Touches,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Apparitions / Voices / Touches :: Christmas Eve Ghost

I t was Christmas Eve of 2006, I had just said goodnight to everyone and gone upstairs to go to bed. I was watching ""A Christmas Story"" for a while and decided to go to bed. My sister stays with us on Christmas Eve, so I had to share my room with her. I let her take my bed and I made a bed for me on the floor (keep in mind that everyone was downstairs). The bed was right in front of my door and it was open so I could see into the hallway. I had fallen asleep (not for very long because my sister still wasn't in bed yet). I looked out the door and saw a girl standing there with her head tilted to one side and kind of swinging back and forth. I was shocked and very frightened, I turned over and, like a little kid, put the covers over my head. There is an attic above where she was standing. We never use the attic and I have never been up there.

The next morning I told my family but they said it was probably just me hallucinating. But I know what I saw. She wasn't transparent or anything like that. It scared me and I still hate to walk by that place at night, when all the lights are off. It just freaks me out!

Who's Presence?,"Maryland, United States",Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: Who's Presence?

L ately, I've been feeling watched when no one is there (a bit more so than usual). Just yesterday, I was looking for something in my closet and the door was opened all the way so it'd stay put. I was looking in the lower section of the closet and the door starts to close on me.  I can feel someone/thing pushing it so I push the door back to where it was and say ""Stop it! Go away and leave me alone!""... then I finally felt alone... and know I'm the only one there.

Later that night, when I'm trying to get to sleep, I feel again the ""watched"" feeling. I search my whole room but no one is there.  So I lay down and try to sleep. The feeling is still there, so I turn to my other side and pull the blanket over my head. I fall asleep for a little while, but I wake up again, turn over, and I see shadows shifting slightly where there shouldn't be any shadows.  I go to put the blanket over my head again, but just before it gets over my head, I feel a breath of cold air on my face. I also notice my vision gets a weird tinted fog over it. I finally get to sleep.

Since the encounter in the story First Real Fright , I've been a bit afraid of being completely alone, I can ignore the weird feelings more easily when I'm with my friends. It only seems to bother me when I'm completely calm. When we moved 5 years ago, we moved into a house my dad built himself just for us and we lived on what used to be just a corn field.

My mom also hears things. She'll hear footsteps and knocking at her bedroom door and also feels the presence in the upstairs hallway. I also feel it and hear it. I think there are 2 different ones though, the one in the hallway seems more like a guy and the one in my room seems to be a girl.  My mom and I are the only ones to hear or feel anything. We're also the only ones to believe in them in my family, as my brother and dad do not.

Good and Evil,"Texas, United States",Old Hags / Night Attacks / Sleep Paralysis,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Old Hags / Night Attacks / Sleep Paralysis :: Good and Evil

I was 16 and I had just met this really cool girl. We became instant friends. As time went on we got closer and closer. One night, she let me in on the little secret that her mother and her practiced witchcraft. At first I was skeptical because my faith runs deep. They explained that white magic was ok and it convinced me. After a few weeks of just ""playing"" around (I thought it was a bunch of BS, so I didn't ever take it seriously), one night, they told me I needed to find my spirit guide and told me how to do this in steps. I had to do this precisely because if I did it wrong, I would get a bad / evil spirit guide (their spirit guide was named Simon and he guided them through the other side). I was supposed to do this mentally when I was between light sleep and deep sleep.

I never tried it though, but subconsciously I must have because the following events happened. I'm not even sure if these events are related.

I was sleeping in the new bed my step-grandfather had bought me. It was a little canopy bed but it was really old. Well, I woke up to find that I couldn't move. I was paralyzed with my feet spread and my arms away from my sides palms up. I was shaking, it was like having a seizure with tears running down my face (I have never had any medical problems) but I was conscious during the whole thing. I saw my dog trying to jump on the bed, but something kept blocking her. There was a hovering cloud of blackness over me trying to suffocate me. I had the distinct feeling that I was going to die and it was very clear to me that this ""presence"" intention was to kill me. It was full of evil, you could just feel it. I remember seeing out of the corner of my eye a white mist, but it was a very thick mist and I got the distinct ""presence"" of good. I felt a sorrow, I knew it was crying like it was losing something important. I could hear it saying ""just let me help, just say the words and you will be safe. Believe in me and I will walk beside you"".

The whole time I am shaking (coming up off of the bed) and crying, trying to scream and kick out of this and get the evil that was weighing on my chest trying to kill me off! And then I caught a glimpse of the white mist that saved my life that night. I remember what it had said and remembered thinking ""I am to young to die, I have not experienced life yet!"". I started to pray and the more I prayed, the worse the shaking became and once I said Amen, the black evil spirit vanished and I was able to kick out of it and run to my parents bedroom banging on the door.

Daring not to look back into the room because somewhere in my heart, I knew that there was something like a battle taking place in there. After a couple of hours, I went back in there and laid back in the same bed and nothing ever happened, just a sense of calm came over me. Now I can sense more than the average person, whether it be a mood somebody is hiding or somebody else in the room that is not alive. Maybe I am just crazy though?

At first I thought that maybe a spirit had come with the bed and was angry that I was sleeping in it. What do you think? Or maybe I stepped into a realm where I was not invited?

The Face of Jerry,"Colorado, United States",Misc,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Misc :: The Face of Jerry

I was walking home the other day when I had this weird feeling I was being followed. Normally I just dismiss this as my friend Caleb playing a prank on me, but this time it seemed different. I walk along an alley that leads from my school parking lot, to my neighborhood parking lot, and there are back yards on either side of the alley fences, obviously divided by fences on the inside. That's what freaks me out about this. As I was walking, I had my headphones on, so the sound around me was a little distorted, but I had this weird feeling... I took them off and turned to look behind me. I didn't see anything. So I kept walking. I kept my headphones OFF from that point on, so I could listen more intently. I suddenly heard a second set of footsteps, coming from behind me. I knew it had to be, because it didn't sound like it could be coming from behind the fence. I turned. Nobody!

I kept on walking... This is where it started to get really weird. In fact, I have absolutely no explanation for this part, because it was simply too weird... I started to hear the footsteps behind me again. Now since a ton of snow has fallen around here, I knew they were footsteps because they sounded just like somebody walking through the snow. Also, as far as Jerry goes (see my other stories for more info), I've heard his footsteps before in my house, mainly if he's turning around to walk away or coming up/down the stairs. Of course, I never SEE him, only hear him. As I was walking, I kept on turning around multiple times, but never once saw anybody.  By the time I got to the top of the slope I heard a distinct coughing. Yep, you guessed it. Jerry! I'd know his cough a mile away. I looked around, expecting something to happen, because usually when he coughs, he's either done bothering me, or is about to cause me some hallucination of some kind. And that's exactly what he did.

I turned around for about the fiftieth time, and instead of seeing Jerry, I froze in place as I looked upon a horde of people standing there. They all looked about my age, they were all punk guys, sitting or standing against the fence. They all had gray skin like Jerry! They also all looked quite... intoxicated. And to my surprise, one of these guys was Jerry himself... He wore Jerry's gray tank top, green pants, had his exact build, his buzz cut, and was looking right at me. His face had nothing odd about it, just normal looking, except for his dead eyes. No pupils. It was scary as hell, but I've seen far scarier things. But finally I saw Jerry's face! About the other guys, I have absolutely no explanation for them. I turned around to walk away, and when I looked back, all of them were gone. In fact one of them even tossed a cigarette to the ground and I couldn't find it anywhere (there's tons of others laying around over in there, but I knew where I saw it land).

But that's not it. When I got home, I saw his shadow at the basement doorway, and he quickly ran down the stairs. I chased him down there and heard him sneeze, but of course, I lost him there. No where to be found. Doesn't matter though, because as soon as I went into the bathroom to make sure I didn't look undead, there's Jerry standing behind me in the mirror. I saw his face again, but he quickly dashed out before I could really get a close look. As far as I can tell he's nobody I've ever seen before. This happened like day before yesterday, by the way.

Boy in the Pool,"Virginia, United States",Misc,"W hen I was about seven years old, my family and I were at the pool. We were about to eat so I went to the indoor pool for a quick swim. This kid, who was probably around 12, started to talk to me. He said ""I know your name."" and I asked ""What is it?"". He said ""Tyler"", which is my name. I have never seen or been around him before, so there is no way he could have overheard my name. So I asked ""How do you know my name?"" and he said ""Future"". Of course, being seven years old, I ran out of the indoor pool, crying and running to my mom. I told her what happened and we went to go find the boy. When we got in the indoor pool, he was gone. Now, I don't know if he was a ghost or just a kid playing a prank on me. I don't know why he would want to play a prank on me.

The Knocking Door,"North Carolina, United States",Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: The Knocking Door

E very night, at around 8:30pm, there are door sounds, like it is being opened. My two dogs won't bark at just anything, and they rarely bark at all, but for the past six nights, the door sounds like it is being opened. My two dogs start barking, and run to the door. When me and my dad get there, the door has not been open, because we have locked both the storm door and the interior door. When we leave and go back down into the basement, the door will be ""opened"" within the next 10 to 15 minutes. When ever I go upstairs to answer the door, I get a cold rush going through my whole body, and I feel like I have just walked into a freezer. Sometimes the door will be ""opened"" again before we can sit down in our basement. I sometimes feel like I am being watched, and other times I just get chills running up and down my back.

The Shadow People,Canada,A Haunted Life,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: A Haunted Life :: The Shadow People

A ll my life, I have had these things following me in the shadows. They only came to bother me about 2 years ago. I recently saw 2 or 3 swiftly moving across the wall, for a moment I thought that I was seeing things, about 2 minutes later I saw about 10 of them closing in on me. This really creeped me out, so I looked them up on the internet. These so called ""shadow people"" have been bothering people for years, and more recently then in the past. I'm not sure what these apparitions are, but they really freak me and others out. Me and my friend caught a few of them on tape, about 2 days ago. I will not release the video until I know more about these strange things. They do not seem to want to harm us, but they do seem to like to annoy people. I'm not sure if they are ghosts, or demons, or anything of the sort. I just know that I'm not the only one who sees them. If you're lucky enough, you might experience this growing phenomena.

Clear Creek,Australia,Ghost Hunting,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Ghost Hunting :: Clear Creek

A bout three years ago my mate (peter) and I decided to go stay out at my nan and pop's farm, which is located just outside of Bathurst, NSW, about a twenty minute drive. The farms name is clear creek. Now there are quite a few ghost stories out there, considering my distant relatives built the farm house three hundred years ago. From hearing all of these stories, we decided to go investigate for ourselves.

I personally believe in the spirit world, however peter did not. There was one particular story about a paddock which we call the ""corn paddock"". There were supposed to have been 100 or so aboriginals slaughtered in the corn paddock back in the day when the aboriginals were slaves to the white man. So we decided to camp in the corn paddock.

About three hours after the sun had gone down, we were sitting around a campfire. We had just started to keep ourselves warm, when we heard someone or something moving in the bushes behind us. We decided to take a look to see what it was, but nothing was there. We then retreated back to our campfire to talk about some of the stories we had heard. After about an hour or so, we were just about ready to go to bed when we heard the same sound of movement behind us. This time, we decided to ignore it, but my friend peter decided for some unknown reason to shout out as loud as he could ""I MOCK THY SPIRITS!"". After he had said that, I had a go at him and told him that spirits were not something to be stuffed with. With that a slow wind started to blow, which sent a shiver down my spine. The wind started to pick up and get heavier. With that, we decided to go for cover in the tent we had set up, almost right away we heard a women scream, which was quite sickening and ear piercing. After that, myself and peter decided not to tempt fate but to run all the way home.

Ever since this occurrence, I am a film maker so me and my crew are now shooting a documentary for DVD and a local TV station called ""GHOSTS OF CLEAR CREEK"". If at all you would like to make a reserve booking for a copy of the DVD or simply have a comment, then please contact me at lukehorder69 [at] yahoo [dot] com [dot] au. With that being said, we are also going to be moving round and searching for ghost happenings to document so if you want something investigated, please feel free to contact me and keep a look out for more stories of my real life experiences.

Father's Day,"California, United States",Family / Friends Visits,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Family / Friends Visits :: Father's Day

A bout 2 years ago, the day before Father's Day, I picked up a picture of my grandfather, who I have not met before. And I said to the picture, ""I wish I could have met you."" That night I was sleeping next to my grandmother. I woke up around 3:00 in the mooring to get a glass of water. When I turned off the sink, I heard footsteps walking into my grandmother's room. When I ran into the room, I saw a figure, a white fog right next to my grandmother. I chocked back a scream when the figure turned to me and I saw my grandfather smiling at me. He looked so peaceful and happy. I blinked back tears as I watched him. He walked around the bed and stood a few feet from me. Then he disappeared with a smile and a wink.

In the morning nobody believed me, except my brother who had witnessed him too. My brother had said that he had seen my grandfather also. I was very surprised that my brother, out of everyone, had seem him too. My parents thought we were going crazy. Though my grandmother told me later on that she believed me and that she had a ""dream"" of him talking to her. It was a very scary night, but I believe I will see him another time. I hope that is. Though I have never met my grandfather, I will always love him.

Footsteps,"California, United States",Family / Friends Visits,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Family / Friends Visits :: Footsteps

A bout a month ago, I was home alone. My brother and dad were out buying a guitar, and my mom was at work. I was working on an essay when I heard somebody calling my name. I was scared, I looked outside of my door and walked around the house with a knife. Every creek of the wooden floors made me scream and turn around. When I found nobody in my house, I went back to my room with the knife, called my friend and closed my door. I told her how scared I was. We kept talking until I became quiet and my music stopped. I did not turn off my music and the song was in the middle of playing. I stared at the computer and my friend kept talking to me, asking if I was alright. A few seconds later, the music started playing again, but a different song. I don't know how my iTunes even got to the song, because I did not have that song. I was very frightened now. I asked my friend if she could come over, and 5 minutes later the door rang. I opened the door to see nobody. I locked the door and sat in the corner of the room near the door, with all the lights on, except the upstairs.

When the door rang again, I ran to get it, there was my friend. I hugged her and told her to help me look. We looked everywhere and found nobody. We decided to watch some TV to calm me down. But when we turned it on, my turtle jumped into the water and I screamed. At that same time, I heard somebody calling my name. The person calling my name sounded like my neighbor, who had died. And we had been given her favorite jewelry box. I heard the calling from upstairs and remembered my mom had the box upstairs too. My friend heard everything. We called my brother's friend, who is 15 now. He came over and we searched everywhere, except upstairs. I was too afraid to go up. We all sat down in the living room, which has a view of the stair case. We were talking about school, when we all heard her. ""Hannah? Hannah! Where are you!"". I knew it was her, since it sounded like her, and that she would call me like that if she didn't see me. I felt a presence in the room and screamed. We all sat together on the couch and I felt something touch my foot. I screamed again and we all sat there, huddling and watching for anything. My parents usually call before they come home, and while we were huddling together, we heard the garage door slowly open. To our surprise, nobody was there. We kept the door open and played some music and turned the TV on. Turned everything on that played music or gave off light.

An hour later, my dad and brother came home with a new guitar and amp. Luckily for me, once they got home, the tormenting stopped. Until that night. That night I was talking to my friends on AIM with my door closed. My parents and brother were watching TV in the living room, which is in front of the house. And I knew nobody would be walking near my room, which is in the back of the house. I heard somebody walking down the small stair case to my hall way, and I saw feet walking, well the shadow of their feet stepping in the hall. The feet stopped right next to my door and I flung the door open. Nobody was there, only a pair of shoes across the hall that weren't there before. The rest of the night I stayed with my parents. And from then on, I haven't seen or heard anything in my house. Though I have from other places. I won't include them in this part, but I will post them later on.

Visitor in the Dark,"Utah, United States",Old Hags / Night Attacks / Sleep Paralysis,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Old Hags / Night Attacks / Sleep Paralysis :: Visitor in the Dark

M y mother divorced my father in 2000, and by 2001 we were living with her boyfriend and soon to be husband Eric. I was new to his home and city. I quickly made friends with a superstitious girl who was not afraid to try something at least once. We were both raised LDS (mormons) and we were both doubting our religion. In an attempt to answer many questions, she and I decided to use her sister's Ouija Board. Some of our questions were answered, but many remained unanswered. Slightly disappointed, we went to her room to talk. That night, as we lay in her room, unable to sleep, we began to hear shuffling noises outside of her bedroom door. Afraid to open the door we turned on the light and watched her door, praying that it would remain shut. Unfortunately, the door did not remain shut. I have heard many stories of doors creaking open on their own, and if the door opened I just expected it to creep open. It did not. The door violently swung open, revealing the dark hallway. The light in her room did not just turn off... the light bulb burst. We sat screaming in the darkness hoping someone would hear us and come to our aid. Unfortunately, we were the only living souls at home that night. We ran from her room upstairs and out the front door. We went immediately to her longtime friend's house, where we stayed for the remainder of the night.

The next morning we cautiously entered her home to find her room totally trashed. All of her things were thrown around, the room and her mattress was laying next to her bed. When her parents came home, they called the police and reported it as an intruder. It baffled the police, they didn't know where the ""intruder"" entered from, what his motive was, how the light just burst and not a single fingerprint was found.

We thought that we were through with what ever had entered the room that night, but we were wrong. Every night around 2:30 to 3:30 am, for the next month, I was tormented. I would hear my name in the darkness and was once even forced awake by my bed shaking. My mother dismissed my stories as outrageous and an attempt for attention. I refused to sleep in my room and was often found on the couch in our living room in the mornings. Then one month after the first attack, it just stopped. I began to think that maybe I was delusional and maybe suffering from a psychotic episode. I did my best to just forget, but couldn't, it was like having something lurking just in front of you in the darkness waiting.

Two years later after putting with an immense amount of bullshit at my mothers home, I moved in with my father and his family. I felt safe at my dad's home and was able to live my life like none of it had ever happened. I was care free and living on the edge. My dad gave me space, understanding, and time to heal. Once I settled down, and finally was free of my burdens, it began again. This time it was more subtle. I would dream about hate, and unspeakable horrors. One of my worst dreams was of a young girl committing suicide after being violently rapped by her best friend. I would wake up in a sweat, always at 5:00 in the morning. It still happens today. If I manage a dreamless night, I am awakened by the whispering of my name. Whatever it is, it has not only attacked me, it has also attacked my friend who has suffered more than me by far.

Was George Really My Father?,"Virginia, United States",Family / Friends Visits,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Family / Friends Visits :: Was George Really My Father?

A fter 25 plus years of not seeing my father (his choice, my parents divorced), I was notified of his passing. Myself and 3 of my 4 siblings attended his funeral. While there, we were upset and talking the funeral director and the lights started flickering. We were mad at our Father and felt he was the one flickering the lights. This was in Connecticut. I returned home to Va Beach and that is when things started. One night my hubby and I went out and we came home, kids sleeping. I was at the computer and hubby was in the living room, when the kitchen faucet came on FULL FORCE! Hubby went in and turned it off... that still freaks me out, wondering who turned it on!

A couple of months later, we moved into our present home. My youngest boy (he was 3-4 at the time) saw a ""ghostly figure"" walk from our front door to the dining room and disappeared. My oldest boy and I heard something fall on the kitchen floor. It sounded like someone dropped a cookie sheet on the floor. When we looked, nothing was out of place. We have wood floors upstairs and we would hear footsteps walking across them when everyone was downstairs. Lights in our house would flicker, one lamp at a time! I even snapped a photo of a figure in my bedroom window. We came to call our visitor GEORGE!

In March 2006, my mother moved in with me. Activity in the house was stronger and also felt ""not so"" friendly visitors, like George was not the only one in the house! Then it seemed like George had left us and I had this bully in my house. Mom passed away about 3 weeks after moving in. When the Father came to give her last rites... no sooner when he said ""And unto you Lord, I lift up my soul""... Mom gave out a large grunt, her stomach sunk in and her chest rose and then all was quiet again. I have this all on video tape. Nothing else happened during her last rites, before or after she did that. Two days later, she passed. My youngest sister was on one side of her and my other sister and I were on the other side. At 11:12 am, Mom took her last breathe, but just before her last breathe, my youngest sister fell back on the bed, rubbing her hands up and down her body saying ""Oh my God, I feel her, I can feel Mom. I feel you Mom... Oh my God"". My other sister and I looked at each other like... ""HUH?"". My youngest sister began smelling her shirt and saying she could smell Mom.

Since that time... Mom's passing, we have not had any experiences, or noticed anything happening in our home. I am wondering, if my Father's spirit came home with me to Va Beach. Maybe he was waiting for Mom to pass on, maybe he knew she would be here. But I can't figure out what the EVIL feelings were or who they were. I know Mom and her Mother did not get along, but I can't picture Nani as an evil spirit. Nor was Mom one of those great wonderful Mothers... she is however, the Mother I don't want to be with my kids... so maybe Mom had to deal with her ""evil doings"" before crossing over. I don't know, I'm just trying to figure it all out... but I will say, I sure do miss GEORGE!

My Grandma Comes to Visit,"Alabama, United States",Family / Friends Visits,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Family / Friends Visits :: My Grandma Comes to Visit

M y grandmother died about 3 or 4 years ago. But I believe that she is still here, in my house, because we have her earn. My friends always come over to my house, and they each say that they feel like they're being watched. One time, one of my friends came over to watch a movie, and during it, I would notice that she would look around the room. I finally asked her if she was ok, and she said that she would keep getting the chills. So we just forgot about it, and tried to finish watching the movie, but about 15 minutes later, she got more chills, and we both felt like there was someone else in the room. So, I told her that I always thought my grandmother was haunting my house. She told me that it was probably her, and she insisted that I introduce her to my grandma. I looked straight ahead, and said ""Grandma, this is my best friend Hannah"". Then we sat there in silence, and my friend said that she felt better. So we resumed watching the movies. Once it was time to go, my friend said that my grandma just wanted to know who she was. I thought to myself that my grandmother is just trying to protect me.

Now, every time a new friend come over to my house, and they say that they get the chills, I just introduce them to my grandma.

Cracking Noise,"California, United States",Apparitions / Voices / Touches,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Apparitions / Voices / Touches :: Cracking Noise

T his story happened during the day, when I was home alone. The date was Monday February, 19th. Around 10:00am. My brother was out at his friend's house and my parents were out at work. On this particular day, it was President's Day, so I didn't have any school. I was making some food in the kitchen when I felt somebody watching me. At that moment, clouds started forming, rain clouds as a matter of fact. When I turned to grab a cup from the cupboard, which made me face away from the main house, I felt like I was being watched. I spun around, to see nothing. I felt shaken up, so I turned on the T.V. After about 10 minutes, I didn't feel anything. But, about after 10:45 am, I heard a cracking noise, almost like foot steps on the wooden floor. My eyes widened and I hid under some pillows with the T.V. on very very loud. I waited under the pillows for a few minutes. After that, I called my friend, who was out shopping. I told her what had happened and she told me to calm down and to wait for her to come over. When she got to my house, I was still in my P.J.'s, I was too scared to change. She sat with me and we talked about anything that we thought of, after that, nothing else happened. I finally finished 3 of my essays and nothing else happened that day. I hope nothing else happens anytime soon, since I don't really like being scared.

"My Father's Friend, our Enemy","Utah, United States",Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: My Father's Friend, our Enemy

I have lived, in my opinion, an unordinary life. If you have read my other story Visitor in the Dark , you know that I have bounced from place to place. I can't stand the ordinary! After I moved in with my father at the age of 17, he and his family had just moved from a home in Tremoton Utah to my father's home town of Kamas Utah. We moved into ""Afton Brimhall's House"". This is the first time that I had lived in a home that had its own name. Afton Brimhall was a good friend of my father's and grandmother's. He and his wife passed on before I had met either of them. Afton and his wife both died within the home, which at the time did not bother me. Death by this time was something that I had excepted and was more comfortable with than some. When we walked in for the first time, my step mom (and best friend) turned to my dad and told him that she couldn't live there. She said that she felt like she was unwanted in the house. I felt nothing. My step mother could not sleep when my dad was away on business, and by this time, I was beginning to feel unwanted as well. My step mom and I decided to just stick together and not let whatever was in our home bother us.

About a month later, business started to slow down and my dad started to spend more and more time at home. As soon as he began spending more time at home, the feelings began to become actions against us. At this time, not only was I experiencing problems with the presence in our home, but I was also dealing with a can of worms that I had opened at my friend's home in south jordan (look to visitor in the dark). The attacks in our home began with my step mom and then extended to me.  The most terrifying of all these experiences was on my step mom's birthday. We went to dinner at trolly square, together as a family, and to temple square to hear the choir sing. When we came home that night and separated to our rooms, I began to notice that the usual feeling of being watched in my room was gone. I didn't know if I should be relieved or concerned. Just than, all the lights in the house flickered and went out, when they came back on, every electronic device in our home activated. At first we thought that maybe it was a power surge. But than it became evident that it was not. We turned off all of our electronic devices, at which point my little sisters were too scared to go to bed. My two sisters shared a room next to mine. So of course, being the wonderful sister that I am, I walked them back to bed. Once in my room, my stereo turned on and began to play one of my favorite songs at the time. Now, naturally I would not be bothered except for the fact that the song, I believe, was a warning. The band that plays this song is CKY and the song title is Escape From Hellveiw. This bothered me. Though I love the song, the message was clear. I quickly turned off my stereo and stayed in my room feeling if I left in a panic it would scare my sisters.

After a few minutes, the stereo downstairs began to play, volume up all the way, the song that I just turned off. My sisters and I met at the stairs and looked down the banister at the living room where the stereo was. My dad burst out of his room furious. He began screaming Aftons name. This scared me! He began ranting about how Afton had destroyed a good night and upset his family. I have seen my dad upset and can tell you from experience, you don't want him mad at you! So naturally my sisters and I sat quietly listening to him rant trying not give away our position to my dad. Once he was done yelling, he went to bed. Now the thing that bothered me the most was the fact that it never happened again while my dad was at home. I believe that Afton respected my dad enough to not attack us while he was home.

One year later my step mom had had enough so we moved again. I have never been back to that house and never wish to return.

The Voice,United Kingdom,Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: The Voice

H ere are the two encounters I've had with ghosts. In the first house I lived in, I was there from when I was born until I was about 8. My first experience with ghosts was on Easter morning, when I was 7. Me and my brother had both awoken early (as you do when your excited), we made our way down the stairs and onto the landing, for some reason we both became very still and heard a very very loud, deep voice of a man, say ""You're dead"".  My brother and I both remember it vividly and agreed that the voice had not been inside our heads and that it had come from a few feet above us (the ceiling was very high). That was my first experience with ghosts. The next story I did not experience first hand, but it did occur in the same house. My younger cousin has just been born, me, my brother, mother and father had gone on holiday and my uncle said he would come round to our house every few days to feed the fish, water plants etc. My uncle brought my newly born cousin with him, he was no older than a few weeks. My uncles left my cousin in the middle of the floor in the lounge and went to check that everything in the house was OK. When he returned to my cousin, all the toys and books that we kept in a big box had been scattered everywhere all around the room. There was no way on earth that a baby could have done that, hell he couldn't even crawl yet. Thankfully I no longer live in that haunted house.

It Runs in the Family,"Utah, United States",Misc,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Misc :: It Runs in the Family

I n my life, I have had many experiences that I can not explain. I began to think that there was something wrong with me. I was hearing things and feeling things that scared me. I felt alone, I tried to tell my mom but she just kept telling me that I was trying to get attention and was scaring my little sister. When I moved in with my dad, I, again, began to have experiences that I could not explain. But this time I was not alone. My step mom was experiencing the same things that I was. I began to ask my family about any experiences that they had. I was shocked by all of the experiences that my dad's side of the family has had and more shocking, some of my mom's side of the family. These are just a few of the stories that I was able to collect. It leads me to believe that I am more prone to these experiences than others. Anyway, here are some of my favorite stories.

My dad has only spoken of this story once, I think that it hurts to much to retell it. My dad as a teenager was wild. Some of his stories seem to outrageous to believe, but you know how stories can get, they get bigger and bigger over time, but no matter what the story, there is always his trusty sidekick. This sidekick was not only my dad's best friend, he was his cousin as well. I think it's better not to give my dad's best friend a name, don't you? Anyway at the young age of twenty five, my dad's friend/cousin died of cancer. His death was dramatic and as I understand it, painful. About five years later, my mother was expecting her third child, but unfortunately, she miscarried. My dad was away on business when it happened. When he came home, he shared a remarkable story with us. His cousin/friend had visited him during his trip and he wasn't alone. He was holding a young girl by the hand that my dad can only describe as looking incredibly similar to me. In fact, he admits at the time that he thought that it was me. He said that his cousin/friend told him that everything is ok, he told my dad that (and I quote), ""I have her, she is safe with me."" It was a great comfort to my dad when he needed it the most.

My mother refused to tell me anything that happened in her family, so I went to my grandpa. Grandpa has never lied to me and has always told me what my mother refused to. He said that one of the most incredible experiences that he ever had was when he and my grandmother moved into their present home. My grandpa was having a hard time and was experiencing things that he could not explained. He said that all of his kids were afraid to go upstairs, so he decided to go upstairs to see what was wrong. As he walked up the stairs he felt the hair on the back of his neck rise. He could feel the presence of something lingering just behind him. He said that he took a deep breath and just kept walking up the stairs like nothing was wrong. He entered the first room at the top of the stairs. The feeling intensified, but he just kept pretending that everything was fine. When he finally got downstairs, he related the story to my grandma. He still to this day claims that if he had turned around, he knew he would have seen it.

My step dad's mother had quite a few interesting stories that, though they do not affect me, they are extremely... creepy. My step grand mom's mother moved her family into a larger home due to growth in their family. She remembers that there was always an empty place at their crowded table. I found this odd because her mother had eight children and yet, they always kept a place at their small table open. Why? Because if ever a plate was set in this particular place it would crack. What ever was in the home did not allow anyone to sit in that certain spot of the table. The same woman, in her younger years, lived in a small home just after marrying her husband. She was cleaning her home when she was suddenly attacked from behind, someone or thing was chocking her to death. She was not a religious woman but had once heard that if you invoke the name of christ, nothing unearthly can harm you. So in an act of faith she invoked the name of christ. Just after she invoked his name it stopped. She immediately got up and checked every room in the house. There was nothing.

One of my favorite stories is of my uncle and his visitor in the night. He was asleep in his room when he heard a noise and looked at the foot of his bed. There, standing in authentic pioneer garb, was a young boy he just stared back and as is traditional in my dad's family, it doesn't matter if the world is coming to an end, you just go back to sleep and think about it in the morning. Unfortunately I could never do that -sigh-.

Unknown Children that Won't Go Home,Canada,Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: Unknown Children that Won't Go Home

I moved into what seemed like a lovely house in Missisauga, ON. I rented the basement with my spouse Jaysin. It started roughly  a month after we moved in, with sounds we could not place and things being moved, entire cabinets being rearranged within minutes. Then a small child-like hand-prints started appearing on my closet mirrors,  they started appearing on my bathroom mirrors, things started getting broken. We tried to be friendly towards them, as we had heard the sound of children, we tried to mother them, as we felt sorry for them. All the time I was living there, I was depressed. One day, I saw the boy ""john"" crying in the corner and then in the middle of the room, on his knees crying into my dress. I talked to him, gave him toys, told him it was ok, things calmed down for a while, then they stopped all together. I cleansed the house and it seemed they had left. However, it all flared up a month later, worse then before. Jaysin started to get hit, poked, and slapped.

I got poked and experienced feelings of sadness, almost like I was dead, I didn't understand it. I started to have recurring dreams of ""john playing, then dying"". He chocked to death each time in my dream on a apple. It made sense to us, as where we lived used to be a farm. However, the haunting would not stop. We tried to clean the house again, it stopped for another month, then got even worse, the physical contact got even more aggressive.

One night, my friend Ash stayed over and said she heard laughter and scuttling in the kitchen. She claimed she thought it was my rabbit at first, but then realized the rabbit was in her cage in my room. She said she heard soft crying, a little girl, she thought. she never returned again to my house after that.

Another night, Jaysin was getting poked and hit violently and he asked it if it could hear him, it hit his head very hard, he then said ""is there something you want me to know?"" It hit his head very hard again, all this time, I heard soft noises I could not place. He then asked it ""how old are you?"" It first hit his head 8 times then 10 then 6 then 8 again, he then asked ""is there something you want to show me?"" It started to hit him hard, he then asked ""I am going to name places of the house when I name the place let me know "". He started naming areas, when he said kitchen, it started hitting him repeatedly. He went to the kitchen and heard the garbage rustling and ran back to the room.

Then the noises and sounds became louder and more persistent. On thanksgiving day, we where enjoying our dinner, and the plates and dishes in the kitchen went smashing into the sink. I also had my rosin (special wax for violin ) smashed into pieces and my goblets all destroyed, and knives thrown off the walls. Another day, I was sitting by the computer and I got smashed in the head by a unseen blunt object. It appeared as though I was getting the rough end of the violence. Yet another time, I was in my house alone,

I got the feeling of being watched by something and the feeling that it wanted me dead. I always felt this way in the house after that.

One night, me and Jay were lying in bed. By this time, we could not sleep in the dark any more. We saw a dark shadow appear in the corner and grow and grow, he jumped up turned on the normal light and it was gone. I was left with that feeling again...

Now, this is where it gets really scary. I started to get the feeling there was more then one thing in the house. I started to get very ill (stomach and sore all over). We could not figure it out. I still felt not welcome in my own home and I wasn't sure what to do any more. One night, just before Jaysin came home, I was showering and I thought he came home as I heard him say ""hi"", I yelled back ""hi"" but he didn't respond. Then I saw a seriously scary face looking through the shower curtain at me, I batted at the curtain, called Jaysin an !*%$#, and looked out there was no one there. Jay wasn't home yet. I left the shower wet, just in a towel and sat outside in the stairs until he came home.

Another night, before he came home, I was in the shower yet again. Jaysin was due home any minute. He walked into the house to me crying, walking out the bathroom, bleeding from my face. I had been scratched 18 times perfect lines across my cheek! He calmed me down and I went to the bedroom. He was inspecting the bathroom and in the span of one minute, I got attacked again, this time on both breasts, on the top of them, 22 slices on each one. He freaks out, walks me to the bathroom to clean up my face and chest, then turns around for a second, and I get it again, all along my back and spine. They burned like no tomorrow, it was the worse pain I have ever felt and they also burned for three days after. We decided we would leave as soon as possible.

The night before we moved, I went to bed, and woke up in the morning perfectly fine, but my leg was killing me I couldn't figure out why, being half asleep I didn't think to look at my leg. Later in the morning, I wondered why is my leg so freaking sore. I looked down and was so shocked, a burn from my space heater was on it, the size of my palm, 2nd degree. What boggles me still is the fact I'm the world's lightest sleeper. Jaysin stirs once in his sleep I'm wide awake. The burn still hasn't fully healed and it has been two and a half months and my chest is scared now.

The one thing I'm grateful for is the fact that I'm alive and out of there. If anyone knows about these things please leave a comment or email me: miss_mittins [at] hotmail [dot] com.

Although they have since healed, the following pictures, taken today, can still show some of the marks left by the attacks:

Three Classmates,Philippines,Misc,"I heard this story from my Lola (grandmother), along time ago when I was only 14 years old.  The story started when my Lola was in High School.  It was after school, when she met her 2 friends, Myrna &  Xuchilt by the school gate, where they always meet to walk home.  She said that all three of them walk everyday together to and from school.  They all lived right next door to each other and it was always been their routine to walk together ever since they were little and it was also their way of staying safe.  After all we are stronger by numbers, right?

One day after school, when they were walking home, my Lola looked down and noticed that her friend on the right, Xuchilt (my Lola was in the middle of the two girls) saw that Xuchilt shadow looked a little off.  She kept looking to Myrna's shadow, her own shadow then back to Xuchilt's shadow, but she can't believe how Xuchilt shadow did not have a head!

So she quickly pointed it out to both of her friends, since they were too busy talking and didn't notice the unusual event that was happening.  She said that Xuchilt didn't act like she was scared, but was just curious why her shadow didn't have a head.  So, they tried to change and switch positions several times, but no matter what they did, Xuchilt's shadow still coming out with no head!

As they reached their village, they saw that Xuchilt's shadow was back normal, she had her head back.  She said they all parted and went their separate ways home.  But little does she knows that would be her last time seeing her friend Xuchilt alive.

The next day her friend Myrna came knocking almost banging anxiously at my Lola's door.  When she opened, Myrna was all hysterical and crying.  My Lola tried to calm her down, so that she can talk and tell her what happened.  When Myrna was able to talk, she told my Lola that Xuchilt's parents found her on bed dead.  At first they thought that she just overslept, so after calling Xuchilt several times, her mom decided to go to her room and wake her up.  She said that as soon as Xuchilt's mom tried to touch her to shake her to wake up, she felt Xuchilt's body all cold.  That's when they realized that Xuchilt was dead.

To this day, they don't know what caused the sudden death of Xuchilt.  She said that the Doctor told the parents that it was Pneumonia that caused it, but no one believes it, because Xuchilt was just fine the day before.  She did not show any kind of sickness when they went home that night.  My Lola believes that it was something evil that took her friends life and it gave them a sign or warning by taking Xuchilt head shadow.

Bleeding Apparition,Canada,Apparitions / Voices / Touches,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Apparitions / Voices / Touches :: Bleeding Apparition

I was downstairs getting ready to go to sleep, when I heard something coming down the stairs, at first I waited to see if I could hear it again... but it had stopped. Or, at least, I thought it did. I went upstairs to get a glass of water before I went to sleep, after I got my water, I finished it and put it in the sink, I started to hear banging noises like when you open and slam a door.  I got so terrified, I was actually so scared I didn't want to go see what was happening to the door at the bottom on the stairs.  Once I had  calmed myself down, I slowly made my way to the staircase.  When I went down, there was blurry figure of a man,  his eyes were bleeding and his wrists were cut so deep, there were holes in the other side of his wrist.  I ran into the kitchen and called my husband to come home from his business trip right away. When I returned to the staircase, the man was gone, I sat down for a few minutes until I had calmed down, then I started making my way downstairs and into my bedroom. I then woke up later at 3:00 am, hearing the door again. Once again, the man was standing there, staring deeply into me with fear.  I closed my eyes and it was almost as if I was dreaming the whole time because I blanked out and had woken up later that morning.  It has been 3 weeks since the scare and I haven't been disturbed once. But two nights ago, I had almost fallen asleep when I heard a ""yoohoo"" coming from the door to the stairway by my bedroom. It sounded like the voice of a man.

The Series of Events that Made Me Believe,Australia,Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: The Series of Events that Made Me Believe

E arly last year, some friends and I moved from our home city of Melbourne to a country town named Shepparton. I had to move because I had a place in the university there, and as such, we were pressed for time in finding a house to live in before first term started.

It was very difficult for four young people to find a house; no real estate agent seemed to want to deal with us. Eventually, however, we met a young real estate agent named Jessica who seemed sympathetic to our cause. She took us around Shepparton and showed us a few rental houses, and it was with some reserve that she showed us the last house on the tour. We fell in love with it instantly.

It was just so easy to get landlord approval on this house - too easy, considering the difficulty we had previously had. We also found out that it had been on the rental market for months with no interest. We joked about it being haunted, but never actually thought it was.

After moving in, the first thing I noticed about the house was the uneasy feeling I got when I was home alone. I decided to buy a cat. The second occurrence was, by far, the most spooky and confusing. It happened to my housemate, Adam. One night, when Adam was in bed, he woke up to view a glowing figure standing at the end of his bed, just looking at him. I wouldn't have believed this story had it not been for the picture he showed me on his mobile phone. Sure enough, there was the perfect image of girl, in full colour and looking as though she gave off her own light. The only flaw in the photo was a black square which obscured her face. Very strange. We looked at the time on the phone and everyone could be accounted for. We then tried in every possible way imaginable to get another photo like that in Adam's pitch black room, but to no avail. Even when we used a torch to take the photos we produced nothing more than a blur, definitely no definition. But regardless of this, I still wasn't entirely convinced.

Our other housemate, Domi, was home alone one night as we were all in Melbourne, but she had to work the next day. She was lying in bed just listening to her music and trying to sleep when she heard the enormous sound of the toilet door being slammed. This freaked her right out because she had just been to the toilet and ALWAYS closes the door. She lay in bed, terrified with her eyes closed, resigning herself to the fact that she would get no sleep that night (because she was so scared) when from behind her eyelids she saw a massive light which she described to me as ""a flash of lightning"", in her bedroom and, although she was terrified a moment ago, was filled with a huge sense of calm and fell asleep immediately, for the night.

A couple of weeks after this, Domi and I were watching the video diary of My Chemical Romance, and Henry, the cat, was sitting on my lap. Tony, my boyfriend, had gone to the shops and Adam was at his girlfriend's house for the night. We had the TV turned up very loud, but not loud enough to muffle the sound of the cat food box being shaken in the kitchen. As soon as we heard this, we paused the DVD, looked at each other, looked at the cat, who could also hear it and was trying to go to the noise, and got the hell out of the house. We could still hear the noise as we were running out the front door. As soon as we got to the footpath, Tony's car turned into the far end of the street. This is when I truly started to believe.

Aside from these freaky happenings, there have been countless others. I have seen the ghost of the father (we figure that it is a father and a daughter, the father being malevolent but the daughter harmless), Tony has seen the father and the daughter, and countless noises have been heard. We also did a séance, in which my initials were indicated by the spirit, however, it didn't frighten me; I felt a lot better after this, as though I had been acknowledged.

I now have a much more open mind and thoroughly believe in ghosts and spirits and whatever else lives out there in the spirit world.

Friend Saying Goodbye,"North Carolina, United States",Family / Friends Visits,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Family / Friends Visits :: Friend Saying Goodbye

M y boyfriend Eddie had a best friend named Jeffrey. They had been friends for over 20 years. I met Jeffrey about 6 months after Eddie and I got together. They were nearly inseparable. Jeffrey was always at our house, spending the night and helping Eddie around the house with repairs and such. Jeffrey had a problem with drugs and was frequently depressed. We had him stay with us as much as he wanted to keep him away from the drugs but Jeffrey would eventually want to go home. The drug dealers lived across the street from him and he always gave into temptation when he was home. One week-end, Jeff became really depressed because his grand-father had passed away and Jeff started drinking and drugging and when he did this, he always had a poor pitiful me attitude. He thought Eddie was mad at him, and this depressed him even more. The night his grandpa died, Jeffrey called us and asked us if we had a pair of dress pants he could have. Then he asked in a crying voice why Eddie was mad at him and I assured him he wasn't.

Later that night, around midnight, the phone rang again, the call came from Jeff's house. I answered thinking it was Jeffrey. It wasn't Jeffrey, it was his aunt. She told me she had bad news, Jeffrey had hung himself in his grand-mother's back yard, he was dead at 34 years old. Eddie's best friend was gone.

The night before, around midnight, we were to visit the funeral home and there was a knock (three raps) on the living room window. The dogs went crazy. I went to the door and walked all the way outside, but no one was there. I didn't think a whole lot of it until the day of the funeral, I was in the shower and, again, there were 3 raps coming from in between the wall and shower wall. I then said ""ok Jeff!"" and closed my eyes.

Diane's House,"California, United States",Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: Diane's House

I met my best friend Diane during our Freshman year in high school (1980). We both lived in Whittier. Diane lived on Mar Vista Street near Colima Road and if any of you know that area, then you know there is a lot of spooky stuff that goes on there. Just recently, you might have heard our local news about a woman's body being found in Whittier, well it was on Colima Road, next to Mar Vista in the canyon area. The woman worked for Coca Cola in Downey and was about to file for divorce when she disappeared for a few weeks. They finally found her body there, in the canyon just under 4 weeks ago. So far the murderer has not been caught but they think it's her husband because for some reason, the woman was going to ask for custody of his daughter from a previous relationship. Not only that but she was also about to testify in a sexual harassment case at her work...

Back to our original story... One day Diane and I skipped school and we went to her house. She had a very nice house since her parents had money and I was quite impressed - well until I got inside anyway. It was beautiful with a lot of great furniture and big rooms but something had me bothered or rather nervous. I couldn't put my finger on it, but I was scared. Diane had to use the bathroom and I asked her not to. She laughed and said what's wrong with you. Needless to say I went with her to the bathroom. We left afterwards to go hang out at the mall and she never said a word about her house. Well, even after high school we remained best friends and I was basically a member of her family now.

One night, I actually stayed there with her. This had to have been in 1986, I believe. The same spooky feeling was there but I got through the night with nothing happening to me or scaring me. Then, a few more years later, either in 1988 or 1989, I celebrated Christmas at her house. I saw her sister and husband in the other room talking, so I walked over to join them. They were laughing so I asked what was so funny and they told me they were laughing about the ghost in the house. I said ""WHAT!""... They went on to tell me that all of them had felt a presence and finally ended up seeing the thing. Diane said that it got in bed with her one time. She felt someone get in bed with her and thought it was her sister Nancy coming home drunk. Diane says that she was laying on her side and that the person put their arm over her.. She looked down but could see no arm yet she is feeling it on her. So she jumps out of bed and ran to her parents room. They told her that they have often woken up in the middle of the night to find someone looking into their bedroom from the hall. They said it would never go into their room but they would see it's head looking in.

Her sister Nancy actually saw it one night. She woke up with the feeling that someone was behind her. She was facing the wall and said she did not want to turn over and look but was scared it might be a burglar. So she forced herself to turn over and said she saw a black, hooded figure standing there. She screamed, jumped out of bed and actually ran right past it into her parents room. She was to see it again but this time in broad daylight. She says she came home from school about 4:30pm one afternoon with her boyfriend and that she forgot her key inside. Well, they found an open window so he gave her a boost and she started to climb in through the window into a spare room, used for storage. She was almost all the way inside when she looked up and saw the black, hooded figure walk right by the room she was entering. She yelled at her boyfriend to pull her back fast and once outside, she told him what happened and waited for her mom to come home.

The ""thing"" eventually did come into their parents bedroom one night and the mother was the one who saw it and started screaming for her husband to wake up but he wouldn't. She even clawed his face with her nails and he still did not wake up. She managed to run and turn on the light and it disappeared. I was a bit angry at them for never having told me this from the beginning. Especially Diane, because she knew I was afraid that first day I went to her house but she said nothing. She said lots of people always got that same feeling when they would go there and she knew what it was, but didn't want to frighten anyone.

They all eventually moved out and their Cousins took over the house. The cousins did not take their ghost stories seriously but from what Diane told me, that family has been in major turmoil ever since moving there. There is a possible cause for all of this. A friend of Diane's father came over one day and asked them ""what are you guys doing with that?""... It was a statue that was found in a Mexican cave and according to the friend, it is some kind of evil God that people would make sacrifices to. Diane's mom said they bought it at an antique store and liked it because it was different. Her parents didn't believe the statue could be haunted so they never gave it a second thought - and yes they did leave the statue there when they moved out.

One quick note about that area (Colima Road), one night when I was coming home from a friend's house in 1998, it was exactly midnight and just as I was reaching the top of the hill, a UFO flew right over the road. I thought at first it might be a reflection on my windshield but I had already reached the top of the hill where there are no streetlights, it's all dark there. The UFO looked like a tennis ball at arm's length and just streaked across my path over Colima Rd heading towards the La Habra area. UFO's, ghosts, murders, urban legends, all of those are well known around the Colima Rd canyon area...

If anyone knows that area, please share any interesting stories you might have.

Duwende,Philippines,Non Human Entities,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Non Human Entities :: Duwende

I was born and raised in the Philippines.  We moved to the U.S. when I was 11-years old.   This story took place in the Philippines when I was 7-years old.  I can recall some of the stuff that happened to me, but not to the fullest.  My uncle retold the story again to me later on when I got a little older.  And then from time to time when we have family gatherings, someone in my family would re-tell the story again as it was a bit mind boggling!

The story started when my Dad and I went to visit his sister, my Aunt and my cousins in the province.  My Aunt has 3-children; one is my age and the other two are a couple of years older than I was.  When we got to their house, I remember my Aunt and cousins came running out of the house to greet us with such joy and excitement.

After the initial visiting, my cousins and I went outside to play Hide & Seek.  My older cousin was the seeker while everyone else hid.  My Aunt's house was out in the woods.  Her house was surrounded by mountains and trees after trees and tall grasses.

There's this belief in the Philippines that most Duwende's [Dwarfs] lives in the forest or a place where there's lots of trees.  And if you cross their path, without saying ""Tabi-Tabi Po Nuno"" (MEANING: Pardon or Excuse me little people) they will cast you a bad spell.  It all depends on the Duwende you came across with.  Some are nice and some are evil.  If you cross an evil Duwende, he/she can cast a death wish on you, some can give you warts all over your body and make you ugly and hideous, so people will be disgusted of you and don't want to be around you.

Back to playing Hide & Seek.  My cousin was the seeker and everyone hid.  I wanted to hide where my cousin couldn't find me.  So I saw this VERY BIG tree, what seemed to be like a hundred year old tree.  Around it, I found a little hole and that's where I hid.  Without thinking and forgetting what my elders told me about Duwende’s, I forgot to say what we're supposed to say and hid a long time in the tree.  After what seemed to be forever hiding, I came out of the hole and went back to where my cousins were.  They said that they have given up looking for me, since they didn't find me anywhere.

That evening before dinner, I started not feeling too good.  I remember the shivers, the many trips to the bathroom vomiting and after that I can honestly say that I don't remember what else happened.  But my Dad and Aunt told me that I was practically in a comma for 3-days.  They said that in some cases, I was hallucinating.  I would sweat heavily, laughed, cried and sometimes I talk to someone in front of me as if someone was there.  But there was no one there.  They even took me to a local hospital, but the Doctors couldn't tell my family what was wrong with me.

So my Aunt asked her kids what we did outside.  My cousins told my Dad and Aunt, that all we did was played Hide & Seek.  They said that I was gone a long time and that they couldn't find where I hid.  My Dad and Aunt then knew that maybe I was a victim on an evil Duwende.  They took me to an Albularyo (Witch Doctor) to find out what was wrong with me.  As my Dad explained to me, he said that as soon as they brought me inside the Witch Doctor's house, the Witch Doctor knew that I was being played or something evil was in my presence.

The Witch Doctor lit a candle.  Took a tub and poured about an inch or two of water in it.  Then she mixed a few drops of some special oil that comes from a plant with the water.  While chanting in some weird language, she took the lit candle and poured the melted wax in the tub with the water and oil.  As she poured the wax, a figure started to form.  My Uncle said that the melted wax on the water formed a huge tree with the hole.  Inside the hole was a human (which was supposed to be me) and around me was about 4 or 5 Duwende's.  Some where just standing there staring at me and some looked like they were throwing something at me.

So the Witch Doctor had advised my family to take me back where that big tree was and to say ""Tabi-tabi po Nuno"" and bring some fruits for offerings.  That same day, my Dad and Aunt took me to the tree and excused me from any wrong doings and brought with them plenty of fruits.  All I remember was waking up the next day without any recollections of what had happened to me!

Demons and Sleep Paralysis,"California, United States",Old Hags / Night Attacks / Sleep Paralysis,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Old Hags / Night Attacks / Sleep Paralysis :: Demons and Sleep Paralysis

B ack in the 80's, I was a bit of a party girl. Hey nothing wrong with that, I was in my early twenties and liked to dance and live it up on the weekends. At that particular time, I lived with my sister Lucille in Whittier near Washington Blvd & Broadway. I would often come home pretty buzzed and would go right to sleep. That was the time that I would see, hear and feel ""unexplainable visitors"". My niece who was 5 at the time, says she would hear me talking to people and sometimes she would hear me laughing or crying. She assumed I was on the phone so she never gave it much thought (heck she was just 5 why would she). Crazy thing, is that I would also hear people and do remember talking to someone. Many a time I thought it was just the alcohol and that I was in that deep sleep that most drunk people get in when they hit the pillow and crash. But I know I wasn't dreaming. I heard the voice and I could hear my own voice as well. There were several times I could not get up and had my eyes open seeing someone coming down the hallway towards me. I was terrified and kept trying to move any part of my body or yell but I never could. And these were in the morning already so there was light in my room and all through the house.

One day I woke up to find I was being made love to. I'm not kidding, I could feel the darn thing inside me and felt the whole endorphin rush. I would also like to add that the sleep paralysis and conversations were not only when I would could home after partying. This would happen on normal, everyday work nights. My 5 year old niece told us one time that she saw a figure standing at her doorway looking in at her. She hid under the covers and passed out (fell asleep). In the morning she was full of sweat from being under the covers. It's a miracle she didn't suffocate. She said that she thought it was me coming home from a late night but I was already home and in bed. She is now 24 and she still swears she saw a figure looking in at her that night.

Well, one day I was just staring at the walls in my bedroom thinking and my God, if I didn't see faces of demons. The walls had wood paneling on them and yes, wood paneling is like the clouds where you can see several different things in it. But I could actually see two forms of demons. I told my sister about that and she told me to keep quiet because she didn't want me scaring my niece. I really wonder if that had anything to do with all that... The wood paneling was taken down and they painted instead...

Fast forward now to 2003 and I am now living in Sun Valley (next to Burbank) with my sister Rose and we are in the process of packing up because she bought a house in Whittier near my mom. One Saturday morning, I woke up tired, cranky, irritable and just did not want to work. I did not feel like packing any boxes or cleaning or sweeping, I just didn't. I told my sister I was not feeling well, so she left me alone (I could tell she got pissed). So as I'm laying there on the bed (it was about 10:30am) I suddenly could not move. I could not scream and I could not think. One thing I could do was HEAR and I heard two distinct voices: One was a demonic woman that said ""we should have never let you get away from us"" - then a demonic man's voice that said ""this time you will not get away from us""... I struggled and struggled and felt my mouth moving and calling my sister Rose, actually I know I was screaming her name - but she was downstairs in the garage and could in no way hear me. After what seemed like an eternity, the pressure suddenly left and I got up. I ran downstairs and asked Rose if she could hear me calling her name, she said No. I told her what happened and she said why didn't you pray to God? I said that I couldn't think, I was just too scared and it caught me off guard.

To this day I wonder who the heck those demons were and what they meant by ""we should have never let you get away from us"".... Was it the same forces that were tormenting me back at my sister Lucille's house in 1989? What's weird is that was the first time I actually heard a female demon voice because at Lucille's I always heard male voices.... Here we are in 2007 and every now and then I get the sleep paralysis but I am thoroughly prepared. I have dreams where I actually talk down the demons that are attacking me and act like some sort of super hero. I rebuke them in the name of Jesus Christ and it always works, they are defeated. For all of you who have been having this happen to you, I notice that none of you rebuke the demons but instead try to fight them off or scream. Rebuking them in the name of Jesus Christ will send them fleeing, trust me, they are powerful words. I've always felt that there is some kind of power struggle going on for my soul. I have never done drugs or played with Ouija boards or anything like that, but I have been suffering from depression for a while now and I know that demons head straight for those that suffer from this. We are easy targets but we can defeat them with simply rebuking them in Jesus' name.

One time that sleep paralysis hit me, I could not remember the word ""Rebuke"" and I could not get those bastards off of me. I instead kept telling them in a sissy way to get off me and leave me alone. As you know, any bully hearing those words will just pound on you more. I notice that after the attacks are over, I am exhausted, both mentally and physically. But it seems that they have left me alone for now and I am somewhat at peace...

A funny thing did happen about 3 or 4 months ago though. I was sleeping on a day bed and one morning I got up a little too early for work, so I got up to turn off the alarm before it went off, because it is loud and always scares the heck out of me, and to put on my fuzzy booties. I then laid back down in bed but I scooted all the way towards the bottom of the bed so I could rest my feet up on the metal frame... I somehow managed to fall deep asleep again and was going to be late for work. I say ""going to be late"" because of the weird thing that happened next. Remember that I had my feet up on the metal frame so they were resting at the top right?. Well something, or someone, ""whacked"" my feet hard and it startled me awake. I sat up thinking someone was there like my mom, but I was alone... I know I felt it because it shook my whole body and I woke up. It was like some old mother coming by your bed and smacking you with that ""get up you good for nothing lazy son of biscuit eater"" attitude... But what amazed me was that I was awaken at the usual time that I get up (6am)... That, right there, proves it was no unusual coincidence because first of all, I felt the hard whack and secondly it hit me at the exact time to get up... I have 3 cats that sleep in my room. At the time this happened I had my black cat laying next to me but she never reacted in any way at all like most animals do when they sense a ghostly presence... However this ""thing"" that whacked me did not seem evil, how do I know? I could just tell or rather I could just feel it. It seemed like a genuine, caring spirit like a guardian angel that people say we all have.

I live at home with my mom now and back in my old room from high school. Nothing weird has ever happened in that room except for the recent whacking of my feet that woke me up. I am not a church goer but I'm strongly anchored in my faith with God and pray to him all day long. I know that my faith protects me like an armor, but I also know I am weak in many areas, one of them being depression. Demons will look for any chink in the armor to break in and depression is one of their favorites so maybe that's why I always feel like I am in some sort of tug of war and have to constantly be on guard. I'm just glad I know now what I didn't know back in 1989 and I sure hope that those of you reading this will start rebuking the demons when you find yourself being pinned down or menaced...

Remember the words ""I rebuke you in the name of Jesus Christ""... Say it over and over and say it loudly even if you can only say it in your head... People, please put on your suit of armor and don't be demon doormats anymore... Best of luck to you all.

Amazing Flaming Light,"New York, United States",Orbs / Lights / Mists,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Orbs / Lights / Mists :: Amazing Flaming Light

I t's so difficult to tell this story to people you just meet because you never know what their reaction will be, ""oh she's insane"".  I love this web site, where I know I'm not the only one that experienced something supernatural. This is real... it's so real.

I was about 15 years old (I'm now 30 but I tell you, it feels like yesterday) and I still shiver when talking about it.  I was in desperate need of help.  I was crying and felt lonely.  Although I'm not religious or anything, I began to pray and ask God for help.  Those teenage years were hard.

I'm sitting in front of a small night table with the bible and a lit candle.  I remember asking for a sign that God in fact existed, because I felt alone.  Suddenly, I got up and blew out the candle and stood there sniffing the dark smoke that it left behind.

As I opened the door to leave the bedroom, a loud but harmonious sound like the ocean but softer surrounded me.  I felt this nice soft pressure from behind... like a presence... I can't even explain it.  It was nice but heavy in a way.  As I turned my face over my left shoulder to look behind, the very strong pressure pushed my face forward.  It was a soft pressure because it didn't hurt nor did it feel cold or hot or windy, but just like a pressure but soft.  It pushed my face forward and suddenly, from behind me came two basket ball size balls of flaming white bright light.  There was one on my right and one on my left.  They flew across the hall that was in front of the bedroom, as I stood in the doorway, and behind these amazing bright balls of flaming light, there were rays of white light left behind, as though painted with a paint brush on my walls.

But when they came from behind me, it wasn't just a pressure anymore.  Suddenly, my hair flew all over the place but I couldn't feel if the wind was cold or hot, just soft.  And I just stood there and stared at the bright balls of fire whooshing beside me fast leaving also a harmonious whooshing, like a soft gentle ocean sound too.

When they reached the very end of the hallway across from me, I heard my sister call me, ""Eli""?  Suddenly, the balls exploded and I was completely surrounded with white bright light like that of a flash from a camera but even brighter.  I couldn't see myself, my hands, body, or anything around me, just bright bright light... oh my God, it was truly amazing.  Then, the light shriveled up into nothing and my sister showed up at the other bedroom doorway across from me and asked ""what was that... I saw like a bright light... what was that"".

I was shocked at what had just happened but surprised that she had seen it too.  So I was kind of nervous and asked her to just come over to me and we closed the door of the bedroom.  I began to explain to her what had happened and how I was praying and asked God for a sign and suddenly, as I'm speaking to her, I look over to the night table and see that the candle was lit!

It was the message.  It was the sign that I had asked for and the bright light.  I began to tell my story to my mother when she got home and my mom, being so religious and all, was in tears.  I told a few people in church and then that was it.  It's just in my heart and memory forever.  I'm not even religious and truly, I don't believe in religion so I'm not a fanatic trying to make the world believe.  I feel that religion is nice but not for me.  It just controls the world and although I did ask God for a sign, I think that all of us have it in us to make such beautiful things happen but we don't know how powerful we really are.  If there is a God, yes I received a beautiful sign, but still, it doesn't mean religion is the way to go.  All I know is that I had an enormous supernatural experience that I'll never forget.

Why Can't We See What They See?,"Kansas, United States",Children Who See Spirits,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Children Who See Spirits :: Why Can't We See What They See?

O ne time my friend asked me and our other friend to go to the local cemetery and place flowers on her father's grave for her, since she was in Kansas City, Ks. We were already here in Garden City, Ks. After picking up some flowers, we headed to the cemetery. I brought my 3 years old daughter along with us and didn't explain to her what a cemetery was because it wasn't necessary. After walking around for a while, trying to find her dad's grave, we stopped at a grave that said something like ""Baby girl Smith 1987"". I told my friend, ""oh look."" We just stood there for a second wondering about what happened, not talking. All of a sudden, my daughter says very matter of fact, ""baby died there."" My friend and I turned pale and said, ""what?"" She just repeated herself. ""Baby died there."" It was so freaky. We wanted to know more, but asking a 3 years old for details is kind of hard. I asked her if she could see the baby and she said yes, but with a look on her face beyond her years. The look was like a knowing, wise expression like yes, sometimes things like this happen.

About 2 years later, we had moved to Tulsa, Ok. Right smack in the middle of Tulsa, there is a cemetery there. One day while driving down the street, right next to the cemetery, I looked over, for some reason, and noticed not one person was at the cemetery visiting graves. Not 2 seconds after thinking that, my daughter who was in her car seat in the backseat said, ""look at all the kids playing over there!"" I looked in the rear view mirror and she was looking over at the cemetery! Just in case I got it all backwards, I looked over my shoulder at her and sure enough she was looking over at the cemetery. I looked again at the cemetery to be sure I didn't see anyone. I asked my daughter, ""you see kids playing over there?"" She said, ""Yeah, lots of them!""

Now she is going on 9 years old and doesn't see stuff like that anymore, but I sure thought it was amazing.

The Piano Room,United Kingdom,Ghost Tours & Haunted Hotels,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Ghost Tours & Haunted Hotels :: The Piano Room

I n my town, there is a huge mansion on the edge of the park, it's open to visitors and people who want to walk through its many rooms, there are tours etc. When I was about 10, my class in school went to look around it one day. As with most big houses, there are ghost stories surrounding it. The story was that a young woman lived there and her father did not approve of her lover so she hung herself in the huge main room from the banister on the balcony. Now you know what kids are like, all the guys in my class were saying they saw a ghost blah blah blah. I didn't really believe it all until I went to use the bathroom. I walked into the bathroom, it was empty and I looked at myself in the mirror and suddenly all the doors on the stalls slammed shut and locked. All of them. Obviously this scared the hell out of me so I bolted out the door and went back to my class. No one believed me though.

I went home at the end of the day and decided I would go back to the mansion on my own and have a look around. I looked through most of the rooms, I had a weird feeling as if I were being watched the whole time. It was very cold even though it was summer. I visited the spot where the woman supposedly hung herself. After a while, I found a circular room draped in red curtains and in the middle of the room was a great big black grand piano facing with its keys away from me. Then I heard music, a slow sad tune issued from the piano and I heard a woman singing, she sang ""Servo meus animus vox vocis of piano"" I didn't know what it meant at the time, the red drapes began to blow as if there were a high wind in the room, the music stopped and I stood for a moment, then took a pen from my pocket and wrote out the bizarre words she had sung to me. ""Servo meus animus vox vocis of piano"" is Latin for ""Save my soul voice of the piano"".

Scary Fingers at 3:00am,"Florida, United States",Apparitions / Voices / Touches,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Apparitions / Voices / Touches :: Scary Fingers at 3:00am

W hen I was young, about 11-12 years old, I had just moved into a new house. The first night we spent the night, I had to sleep on the couch because my bed was not in my new room, yet. I was laying there on the couch, trying to get some sleep, but I couldn't, so I got up and got some water. I looked at the clock and it showed 3:00 am. When I laid back down, I felt something run up my back like fingers. I looked back and there was nothing there. At first I thought it was just a spider until I felt it again. This time it was on my arm. I screamed and ran into my mom's room. For the next month or so, I kept feeling the fingers on my back and arm at exactly 3:00 am. Then one night, instead of touching me, something bit me really hard and I started bleeding like crazy.

We moved away after that happened. Just recently I have been back to that house. I went inside and it felt so weird being back there. When I fell asleep that night, I felt something like fingers rub against my back and then my arm. I looked at the clock and it was exactly 3:00 am. It has been two weeks and I am scared to death.

L ocated in Moundsville West Virginia is the old West Virginia State maximum security prison. Now this prison has a long and sometimes violent history. Prisoners were murdered in their cells by other inmates, during riots, and most notably, they were put to death in the electric chair, ""old sparky"", who was built by an inmate from that facility. The prison is closed now, but you can still tour it, and if you are brave enough even spend the night there, of which I plan on doing once I return stateside.

This story concerns the day light tour I took of the facility while I was a corrections officer with the state of West Virginia. Once we had received our initial briefing about the facility, we were allowed to tour it on our own and pretty much go where ever we wanted, even places the public isn't allowed. While touring the facility, I was in a section of the prison known as the sugar shack, supposedly where some of the worst offenders were housed. I was the only person in this section of the prison at the time and while I was up on the third tier, inspecting some of the old cells, when down below me the cell doors slammed shut.

Now, this wouldn't have come as much of a surprise to me if it weren't for the fact that all the doors had closed at once which is what they are supposed to do, but they are controlled by a lever from a central location which I could see from my vantage point and no one was there and the lever was still in the up position. Taking that as a cue, I left that section of the prison and made my way down to the basement and the location of the HOLE, this was a place they say drove some inmates mad. While in the basement, I kept having the feeling of someone following me and as I grew near to the hole, a feeling of dread and despair almost overwhelmed me. I kept my senses, though, and started to make my way deeper into the basement. I caught the glimpse of a figure, just off in the shadows, moving from right to left that should have brought them into the light, what little there was, but they never appeared and I didn't see them go the other way.

Once again I took it as a cue to leave. I went from there up to the medical and dental ward of the facility, no physical events took place here, just a sense of foreboding over the area. This has all lead me to believe that something is still behind the walls of this prison and that they may never be able to leave. I am going to do an all night ghost hunt of this facility and I plan on taking some video and audio equipment and see if I can capture any thing on film or tape.

The Portal of my Life,"Iran, Islamic Republic of",Psychic / Medium,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Psychic / Medium :: The Portal of my Life

I guess when I was born, I got this gift, a gift that I couldn't face until I was 10. The reason why I couldn't face my problem was that some were good and some very bad, and I was small and I had no one to talk to. Even if I did, no one would understand me, it truly is a small world for some of us. I'm 32 now and I learned that if you don't pay attention to certain things, they won't pay attention to you. It some times sucks when you're at a funeral and you happen to know the person. My personal opinion on the matter is I can see not 1 but 3 dimensions while most people can only see 1. My every day living is a story. I wake up and see people, some can be seen and others you can't and they always mumble. Sometimes, I can't see them, but I can hear them. I also see figures from out of this world, demons with horns, although they never show there actual face to me, but I can smell them and feel that they have bad intentions. I'm a good christian, I guess that's why they don't bother me much. It's funny, the older I get, the more I see and feel.

A Ghost on my Sister's Bed,"New York, United States",Apparitions / Voices / Touches,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Apparitions / Voices / Touches :: A Ghost on my Sister's Bed

I 'm 31 years old, but back when I was 16 years old, I lived with my parents along with my two brothers (I'm a triplet), and two sisters in a New York City apartment Upper Manhattan. I was in my bedroom finishing up my homework. There was one math equation I could not figure out. Since my sister Pamela is a wizard when it comes to Mathematics, I decided to head over to her room. Her door was slightly opened and I walked in.

I saw a medium built guy, about 6 feet tall, sleeping perfectly on her bed. As I move closer, his eyes opened and gave me a blank stare. I freaked out and ran and noticed my sister was in the living room.I told my sister what happened. That 'boyfriend' was trying to scare me. ""I don't have a boyfriend and I didn't bring anyone home with me."" I grabbed her hand and lead her to bedroom, only to see he was gone. I know it was no intruder since the windows were locked at that time.

I was a bit disturbed by the fact I had my own encounter with a ghost. Before this incident I was skeptical about ghost now I'm a believer.

Glass Shattering Spirit?,"California, United States",Misc,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Misc :: Glass Shattering Spirit?

I live in California with my brother. I've been living with him for two-years and only recently have been experiencing paranormal activity. A few months ago, I was sitting here, at the desk, and all of a sudden the light fixture on the ceiling exploded. I was lucky to have been some feet away from it so I didn't receive any injuries. My brother called the people that installed the light fixture and they said that there was nothing wrong with the wiring and nothing wrong with the wattage of the bulb that they put in. Okay, so case closed.

Couple weeks ago, I was in the kitchen and the light hanging over the dining room table began to swing back and fourth. I immediately thought that we were having a mini-earthquake, but nothing else in the house moved or shook and I couldn't feel anything, so I just shrugged and walked back upstairs. I told my brother and he, being interested in the supernatural, thought that we should break out our Ouija board (we've had the same one for years, we got it from out great-grandmother). We sat there for forty-minutes and waited for something to pop up, nothing did and my brother came to the conclusion that I'm seeing things.

Just the other day, I came out of my room at 2:00 am to get something to drink and the door of the fridge was open and there was milk all over the floor. My brother wasn't even home and didn't come home until 10:00 am that morning. I have 3 dogs, only one of them has barked at random things on the wall and staircase.

Little Boy Crying,Canada,Apparitions / Voices / Touches,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Apparitions / Voices / Touches :: Little Boy Crying

B ack in 1987, my sister and her husband used to live in an apartment. Her husband's mother lived upstairs and this was in a house but both apartments were separate from each other. One day, when my sister was home alone, she went down to the basement during the day to do some laundry and she heard a little boy crying in the dark. My sister was nervous of turning on the light. So, she asked him ""Little boy, why are you crying?"" He responded ""Because I don't like the dark!"". She told him she would get a night light for him. When she returned and plugged the night light into the outlet... he must of vanished and she could no longer hear him. My sister found out later that years ago a family lived there once and their little boy died of a disease in a hospital not to far away.

The Park Street Apartment,"Wisconsin, United States",Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: The Park Street Apartment

M y older sister Sam rented a two-bedroom apartment on South Park Street (Park House Apartment) in Madison, Wisconsin during her junior year at UW-Madison.  There was a beautiful corner window in the living room but a huge pine tree blocked the window from the busy street.  Whenever Sam called me, she would be in tears and telling me about the latest ghostly figure she'd seen.  I would brush it off my shoulders and roll my eyes at this.  After months of Sam begging me to visit her, I finally did.  When she opened the front door, my eyes were automatically glued to the hallway and all the little hair on my back neck stood up.  Sam gave me a tour of her place - opening closets to show me how much space she had and trying to convince me to move in with her.  When she opened her bedroom walk-in closet, I felt goose bumps on my arm.  I told her to close it right away because I had a feeling that someone hung themselves in there.

That summer, my parents dropped off my two little sisters to stay with Sam.  Sam's the irresponsible one in our family.  That weekend, she felt so stressed out that she decided to leave the two little sisters at the apartment, in a new big city, while she went to the clubs with some friends.  My little sisters, Pom and Him, were excited be left alone without adult supervision.  At around midnight, Him fell asleep on the futon while Pom watched TV until her eyes couldn't open anymore and she laid next to Him.  A few minutes later Pom was woken up by the sound of clunking of high heels on concrete coming towards the front door.  She also heard voices of women talking and laughing then the sound of keys sliding through the keyhole.  Pom was happy that Sam was back.  She waited there in the dark, the front door never opened.  Pom dashed to the corner window to look and see if Sam's car was back, it wasn't - she saw something else.  A dark figure was sitting next to the huge pine tree - Pom noticed the outline of the figure to be a little girl who had curly hair and a puffy dress.  Pom screamed, waking up Him and the both of them held each other and cried.  Not more than 5 minutes later, they heard voices and high heels on concrete then the front door opened with Sam and her friends walking through the door.  The girls never went back to stay with Sam.

When I moved in with Sam, we both shared her room - I slept on the top bunk.  Sam situated her computer in the corner desk so that when you sat down to use the computer, your back would be facing the walk-in closet door and the bedroom door.  Every time I'm on that computer, I have the tendency of turning around because I would feel someone was looking at me from the doorway.  All my friends thought I was going crazy because I was cooped in there with Sam, who they thought was a little lunatic.  They came over once to cheer me up.  We were all sitting on Sam's bottom bunk, talking and laughing.  We even put on a little music.  One of my friends cranked up the music and started dancing.  The rest of the girls joined.  The music faded shortly.  It's as though someone turned down the volume.  This happened several times, we got scared and ran out to the living room.  We all heard the door slam and my friend, who ran out last, was screaming.  She said she felt something pushing her out and the door slammed on it's own.

Months went by, Sam and I got use to living with ""the others"".  All our friends still came over to give support to be with us so we won't freak out.  Sam saw the figures the most - sometimes when the figures saw her, they were scared as well.  It got to the point where I would hear Sam talking to herself or cursing and screaming at the top of her lungs.  When I ran to see what was the matter, she'd tell me that she was yelling at the figures to go back to heck.  The two of us thought we were really losing it, until my entire family moved in temporarily for 2 weeks - until they could get into their new home.

My older brother set up his computer in the living room.  Each night after work, he'd stay on it until 2:00-3:00 in the morning on this computer.  One night I was watching David Letterman while he was on his computer.  After about an hour, I turned off the TV and head to my room.  Several minutes later, he came in and asked if I turned off the TV.  I told him I did.  We walked together to the living room and the TV was turned on but it wasn't on any channel, it was just fuzzy.  He turned it off and I head to bed.  Each night after that, the TV would turn on by it self and it would be fuzzy.  He checked the circuits and made sure nothing would trigger it to turn on, even keeping the remote next to him.  Still it turned on by itself.

After that started happening, the computer in our room would turn on by itself.  Nights when I completely shut down the computer and unplugged the power cord, the computer would run by itself even if the power cord was not plugged in the outlet.  There were someone or something that was messing with us for its amusement.

My little niece, who was only a 3 years old at the time, would run around our apartment - laughing and playing by herself.  When I asked what she was doing, she'd tell me she's playing with her new friend.  She was too young to be having an imaginary friend.  One morning I found her in the second bedroom under the covers.  I heard her saying that she's going to tell her mom something if her friend wasn't going to behave.  When I uncovered the comforter, I found my little niece sitting by herself but she had scratches on her face - as if tiny little fingernails dug deep into her cheeks.

The last week when my family was to move into their new home, my mom slept on Sam's bed in the bottom bunk while Sam was on her computer.  My mom woke up but just staring around the room and she didn't stir in bed.  She saw a person standing by the bedroom doorway and thought it was Sam.  But when she looked closer it was a little blonde-haired girl who was wearing a puffy Victorian dress with black buckled shoes and a big bow in her hair standing there looking towards Sam.  My mom said the little girl reminded her of the Alice in Wonderland but she had curly hair.  The little girl turned around and disappeared in the hallway.

That alone answered many questions we had about why we always felt eerie when we were on the computer or why the computer and TV would turn on... and who was playing with my little niece.  We are still trying to find out what happened there and who the girl was... When I drive past that apartment complex, I still get goose bumps.

The Furry Fingers,"Wisconsin, United States",Non Human Entities,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Non Human Entities :: The Furry Fingers

W hen I was in the second grade, the family and I lived in a really creepy old house.  I always thought it was neat though because I wasn't scared of anything when I was younger.  One night, I had a dream that I had the urgency of  using the bathroom. So I got up and walked down the hallway and to the bathroom. I felt the coldness from the bathroom tiles. I reached up to turn on the lights but it flickered and died.  After flushing the toilet, I felt myself walking backward toward the bathroom closet.  It was as if my body magnetically attracted to the closet and I couldn't control myself.

I felt my head bang on the door and the closet door open with a pair of furry fingers reaching out and it touched my arm.  Its nails were long and sharp.  I would say it looked like a pair that those werewolves have in the movies.

When I woke up that morning, I found myself sleeping on my bedroom floor.  I immediately remembered my dream and lifted my shirt arm to see if I was hurt because the dream had seemed so real.  There was a brown mark on my arm in place of where the furry fingers had touched.

I told my mom about it.  She was shocked and speechless at first then said she's never seen such a mark on me before and said it was probably nothing.  I still have that mark on my arm and never really distinguished if it was a dream or if it were real.

Incident at the River,"Alaska, United States",Psychic / Medium,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Psychic / Medium :: Incident at the River

T his happened to me last summer. I was sitting at home alone because all of my friends were out of town. I was getting pretty bored so I decided to ride my bike out to a nearby park. When I got there, I saw that no sports teams were having practices and no one was out playing. Finding myself alone, again, I thought it would be neat to go to the river which runs along the street opposite the park.

People aren't supposed to go down there, but kids do it all the time so I climbed down the steep hill and sat on a rock. I closed my eyes and tried to relax a little, when I heard what sounded like someone who is drowning splashing around. Suddenly, I felt these really cold hands grab my ankles and drag me into the river. This river runs fast and I freaked. I swallowed a mouthful of water and everything went black. I forced my eyes open and found myself floating in the center of a circle of bodies. Their skin was all grayish-blue and decaying and I tried to scream, but couldn't.

I suddenly found myself sitting on the rock next to the river again, almost as if I'd dreamed the whole thing, and then I started coughing up water! I heard a disembodied voice come from out in the middle of the river telling me to leave. I wasn't about to argue with that and I ran up the hill, across the street, and rode my bike home as fast as I could.

Later I found out that the river used to be level with the road, and countless cars fell into the river. At least a dozen deaths were recorded there and I don't even want to think about the relevance my experience might have with the Native culture here.

The Flowing Figure,"North Carolina, United States",Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: The Flowing Figure

T his happened the summer of 2006, we were on a family vacation at oak island North Carolina. We were staying at a house owned by my aunt and uncle and this house was the creepiest house there ever was. One day, me and my sisters were playing in the drive way and the window of the room downstairs started to raise up really slowly and you could see a dark figure standing there. We were so scared when we went in the room to see who was there but, to our surprise, the room was empty and the window was closed. Thinking nothing of it, we kept playing.

About 45 minutes later, our mom called us in with an urgent tone. When we went in, she was scared to death. We asked her what had happened, she said that she had the feeling someone was in the house with her so she said ""if this is you robena haunting this house, then give me a sign"" and just as she had said, that a cool breeze had went over her, but she was in no reach of the fan. Later that night, when me and my sister got up from bed to go to the bathroom, I saw a big gold mirror over the couch but I didn't really think about it then. When we went back to bed, my sister turned over the other way and I was laying on my back. I kinda got scared so I asked ""are you asleep"" and since I got no response, I turned my head the other way. And what I saw made me almost cry. It was a tall white figure with flowing hair and black eyes. I hit my sister and made her get up and look and she saw it too. We both ran into the living room, screaming and woke our mom up, she was a very light sleeper but she didn't hear us screaming. And as I looked above the couch, there was no big gold mirror.

We packed up all our stuff and left that house at 1:00 in the morning. When we got home, we told people about the ghost we saw and they had had similar experiences. We also found out that our grandma who had lived in the room below had owned a gold mirror. It was the scariest thing that there ever was. But we go back there every summer.

My Little Brother's Guardian,Ireland,Apparitions / Voices / Touches,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Apparitions / Voices / Touches :: My Little Brother's Guardian

T his happened in the summer of 2006. It was during the day, I'd say around 3:35pm at least, I'm guessing. The sun was out, and there was a lot of traffic and kids playing around outside. My little brother had a few friends over to play. My mom was busy talking to some of the neighbors, and my dad was helping out with the plumbers in the bathroom because we where getting it fixed up. My older brother was out with his girlfriend for the day, and I'd say this was a Friday, I don't know why but I have the feeling it was.

Everything seemed normal, I was on my bed sorting out all the pictures that were all under my bed, and my mom told me to clean them out. My little brother came up constantly to get some of the toys out of the toy box at the end of my bed, and I got slightly annoyed because me and my mom had a little fight that day and I wasn't in the mood for anyone.

My mom comes up to show one of the neighbors the new wardrobes we had just got in, I made an angry sort of face and continued to sort out the pile of pictures or photos. Again and again my brother came up, and I quickly got real annoyed. He dropped a load of toys all over the floor, ""I'm not picking them up!"" I yelled, ""clean it up now or I won't let you in my room again"". As I gave out, I looked over my brother, and just outside the room on the landing floor stood a very attractive blond haired lady with a modern day white top, like a cardigan and a red end dress just past her knees. I didn't say anything to her, I thought she was a friend of my mom's so I wasn't scared. She however made an odd sort of face at me, it was the kind of face enough to say ""don't talk to him like that"" or ""you're a very mean sister"". I made a face enough to say ""ah well whatever"" back to her.

Then I decided to help my brother because I didn't want to make a bad impression. Everything was clean, ""Now that's grand, try not to keep coming up"" I said. The lady was gone. Later I went down stairs, ""Why where all the neighbors in the house!"" I said to my mom. She was cleaning the counter, ""I brought Alan's (my brother's friend) mother up to see the wardrobe"". I looked, ""who was that other one then?"" I said, and I wasn't expecting the reply I got, ""There was no one else"" she said. I didn't get scared but I repeatedly kept saying that there was, and soon my mom was annoyed and said ""you will end up scaring your brother, stop that nonsense!""

Over the next few day's, my mom spoke to me, and told me to tell her the story when my little brother wasn't around, she decided to get the house blessed again, but of course she was only doing it to make me feel better, and every time I bring up the story, she laughs, and so does my older brother. My dad suggested with a little laugh ""If It was a ghost, it was your brother's guardian angel. After all, she wasn't impressed with the mean comments you gave your poor little brother"".

I never saw her again, but I often get a little feeling I'm being watched, especially around David, my brother.

The Irish Holiday Ghost,Ireland,Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: The Irish Holiday Ghost

J ust 3 years ago, in 2004, me and my family went on a two weeks holiday to the Holiday center in Cork. Anyone from Ireland will know Trabolgan, the holiday center. We arrived there, and our little cottage-like house we had to stay in wasn't cleaned at all properly from the maids and it looked like a house from the dark ages. There was me, my older brother Paul, David, my little brother, my parents, my cousin Jamie, and my aunt Katharine. The center was more for children then adults or teenagers, so it was between me and my brother to watch over our little brother and his cousin.

The town had a show on each night for the kids, and we would all go around, the adults would usually have a drink for themselves, while a children's show was on. However, David and Jamie got tired one night, so my mom made a suggestion ""Paul has had the kids long enough, it's your turn to watch them"". So Paul went off into town to go to a dance hall or something. ""Bring the kids back to the house and put on a film, or draw"". So I did. The cottage was stuck onto houses and from the back entrance, there was only one little tiny gap to get out or in and a large circular green. As we took the ""BACK"" entrance, there wasn't a soul in sight, no kids, no nothing, most of the house lights where off, and you could hear crickets.

I opened the back sliding door and went in with Dave and Jamie. We were there for about 5 minutes, when I heard a knock on the back door. The door was made of glass and the curtains where shut. I was expecting to see my mom at the door, but when I opened it there was no one there. I looked out and around the side, but it was pitch black and real quiet. You could see the forest over some of the houses, it was actually spooky. I suspected it to be kids playing. I went in and closed the door behind me, but just as I walked away, I leapt out of my shoes because the bang on the window was as if someone had given it a bang hard enough to try and break the glass. Ghosts weren't on my mind, I was so scared I thought it was a murderer. I took Dave and Jamie into the bathroom, I wanted to run and go back down to the show where my mom was, but I was scared. David then got scared because he saw the look on my face. I then got up my courage and went right out the back door. To my surprise, it was completely quiet, and bare. No lights on, no one in sight, not even down the road we where walking.

I told my mom, and she said, ""well, don't worry we're all going back anyway, it was probably just kids"". A few days later, everything that could go wrong went wrong, it was as if the house was cursed, there was no banging or ghost apparitions, it was just plain bad luck. Something that my family never do is leave a holiday early. We packed our bags, and headed off as quick as we could. The morning we left, tiny insects formed all over the skirtings of the windows, I actually got that on cam.

Staring Ghost,Ireland,Apparitions / Voices / Touches,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Apparitions / Voices / Touches :: Staring Ghost

T his happened I was about six, and my brother Dave wasn't even born. I lived in a flat, and me and my family all slept in the same room. I slept on the bottom bunk bed, my brother Paul on the top, and my mom and dad were over on the double bed. The window was facing my bed. About 5:00 am in the morning, I awoke, the room was black and all I could hear was the rain on the window. Outside the window, there was no entrance, so there was no way any person could have gotten in from the back. I couldn't sleep so I looked around, and I glanced over at the window just for a second, I couldn't take in what I saw, but my heart leapt quickly. Right there just looking in the window was the face of a man. I couldn't tell features, but he looked angry, and his mouth was open, and his eyes where huge. They seemed to stare at me, and I was staring at him, I didn't scream because I couldn't. I pulled the covers over my head, and peeped out. He was still there. I looked over at my mom and dad, they were fast asleep. I decided not to look at him again. I just pulled the covers over me, closed my eyes tight and stayed there. The next morning, I told my mom, she laughed and said, ""Ok I'll get curtains"".

Encounter With my Uncle's Ghost,"New York, United States",Family / Friends Visits,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Family / Friends Visits :: Encounter With my Uncle's Ghost

I have a couple stories, I know it's long, but trust me, they're worth reading. When I lived at my dad's house, I could never sleep in my own room because I was scared, I knew that his house was haunted so I would sleep with him in his bed. When I was about 10, I think, I started to actually see ghosts. I saw one when I was running the bath water go from my room to the other, I had 2 rooms, and those where the only ones it would go into and it terrified me because the ghostly figure had an axe in his head and I believe that it's the previous owner of the house. He passed away during the war and he hid real silver in that house somewhere and no one has found it until this day. When I was forced to sleep in my own room, my bed would shake and I would have to cry myself to sleep.

When I went to visit my mother, one weekend, I was sleeping in the bed with her and her boyfriend's daughter and I woke up because I lost my stuffed animal. I was about 8. I found it but when I got up, I noticed a girl with a bright light around her and she walked over to the bed where we all were and she picked up my mothers arm and started twisting her wrist and I screamed ""stop! stop!"" and she shook her head like saying no, she wouldn't talk though, so I woke up my mom saying ""wake up, there's this little girl twisting your arm"" and she said ""heather stop! your scaring me!"" The little girl ended up leaving and I followed her to the door and she was gone, she like vanished. The next morning, we had to go to the hospital. My mom had a sprained wrist.

My uncle passed away about 2 years ago and he owned a business. Now my mom and step dad own it. A psychic visited there and she asked the worker ""did anyone die in your family?"" and my mom answered ""my papi"" and she replies ""no, someone younger"" and a worker said ""my boss"" and the psychic described him and the worker said ""yeah, that's him"". So she told the worker that he was there and he was standing right by her and he looked mad because she was reading her book and not doing her work and he always hated that. The worker tried staying away from that area and before the women left, she told the worker that he was standing over there now, which was where the worker moved to. So the psychic met with my mother, they were talking and my mother asked ""is he here now?"" and she said ""no, would you like me to call him?"" and my mother said ""no, that's ok!"". She gets scared easily.

Later my mom got this really cold chill and she looked over at the lady who felt it too and  the lady said ""he's here now and he wants me to tell the family he's sorry, he was in shock that he was dead, but someone was there to help him"". What was scary about it was that right when he came, the song that we gave to him played.

A couple days later we got in contact with her again and she told my mother that my uncle was mad that we haven't made contact with him. So the next day, when the business closed for the night, we brought the Ouija board and we did it in the back and it worked. He came and was talking to us. Me and him were very close and we asked where he was and he spelt out my name and that he was standing behind me and I started to cry and my mom told him ""you know that Heather loves you and misses you a lot"" and he said ""yes"" and then she asked ""are you her guardian angel?"" and he said yes and that made me cry even harder. We asked him if he would touch me and he said yes, so I waited and we asked if he did and he said he did but I didn't feel anything because I had his big hood on so I took it off.

He wanted us to take a break, so one of the girls wanted to go to the bathroom, but was scared to go by herself, so I went with her and I walked by one of the rooms. It smelt like gas and there was no gas in the place, so I just kept going to the bathroom.  While I was waiting for the girl to come out, I felt something tap my head and I looked everywhere and nothing was there and I knew that he had touched me. I walked back past that one room where I smelt gas and I called my step dad and mother to come close to smell it. My step dad didn't smell it, but my mother did and I knew that it was a sign of my uncle's presence because he died in a car accident, his car went in flames and I think it was because his gas tank blew up.

We went back and started talking with him again and we asked him to show himself and he said he would if we went to the graveyard by the hill. The hill is right by his tombstone, but we didn't go. That night I had a dream and he was in it and it was his funeral, it was like a party, I don't know why, but I saw him talking to my step dad and I told him to come here and he said ""no, you come here"" so I went up to him and he hugged me and he whispered to me ""it's ok, you can let me go"" and I said ""I can't"".

I started crying and I woke up feeling his arms around me and I smelt him. I woke up out of that dream crying. It was really him, I knew he was there.

J. Timothy's Taverne,"Connecticut, United States",Apparitions / Voices / Touches,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Apparitions / Voices / Touches :: J. Timothy's Taverne

J ust recently, I was at J. Timothy's Tavern in Plainville, CT with a friend.  We were standing in the entry/exit way, waiting to be seated when she pointed to someone standing by the fireplace.  I couldn't hear what she said, but I noticed a single, solitary man standing alone, staring off into the distance.  I was surprised no one else was looking at him because he stuck out like a sore thumb in his blue tailored jacket and blank expression.  My friend left me briefly to talk with someone, and while she had her back turned, the man walked past me.  It creeped me out the way he stared straight ahead and no one else was looking at him.  He gave me a strange feeling, so strange that I wanted to reach out and touch him, just to make sure he was real.  Instead I just watched him walk past me and into the next room, and I can't quite explain it, but I just didn't see him anymore.  I thought maybe he had ducked down onto one of the bar stools, but, nevertheless, decided to mention it to my friend when she returned to me.

""That man that you were pointing to was really creepy."" I told her. ""What man?"" She questioned, confused.  She said she had been pointing to one of the waitresses and hadn't even seen anyone by the fireplace. We decided to investigate by wandering into the first room, but as I studied the faces and jackets, he wasn't there.  The only other room that he could have been in was a closed off one, but on our investigation, we discovered a set of stairs leading up to a private party room, overlooking the other one, including some of the hall we had just been in.  I studied every face, every jacket, and he wasn't among them.  We continued searching every other room (although there's no way he could have gotten to them without crossing out path again) and he wasn't anywhere.

Friend Not Moving On,"Connecticut, United States",Family / Friends Visits,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Family / Friends Visits :: Friend Not Moving On

W hen I was younger, my cousin Felix was killed while serving in Iraq.  Ever since then, strange things have happened at his mother's house... The first events started one night at a get together.  All of Felix's friends, my aunt, and my sister were sharing stories of him when he was little.  A beer can that was sitting in the middle of the counter next to them, with no warning, flew off it.  Not rolled, flew.  Like in the air.  They all started laughing at that point.

Another time, my older sister and her boyfriend were lounging in my aunt and uncle's pool when my sister went in to use the bathroom.  She came out of the bathroom and into the hallway, and that's when she heard distinct voices, a male and female.  It sounded like they were coming from my cousin's old room.  She peeked in there, but there was no one and no TV.  She investigated every room in the house and there were no radios, TVs, or anything on, but she still heard the voices coming from right outside the window of Felix's old bedroom.  When they suddenly stopped, she went back outside and questioned her boyfriend.  He said he hadn't been talking at all, just swimming.

This even happened a couple times.  My cousin's old cell phone was kept in his car.  My aunt and uncle never used it, but just keep it in the holster.  One time, my aunt and uncle came home from a restaurant to discover 3 messages on their answering machine.  The first one was from a friend.  The second one was a garbled male voice, people in the background.  The third one was near silence except for a small male voice that could barely be heard.  They checked the caller ID and were shocked to find that the calls were from Felix's phone.  They rushed out to the garage and checked the car, but the phone was in its place and still turned off.

Two Girls Bickering,"Ohio, United States",Apparitions / Voices / Touches,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Apparitions / Voices / Touches :: Two Girls Bickering

O ne day me, my sister Jessie, and my two friends Heather and Jenna were up in my sister's room. My dad was making us dinner at the time. Before we all used to talk to candles and we asked if there was a ghost. We said ""flame go up if your here"" and it went up really high. So we asked if its name was Carl or Carly because my sister had a feeling that it was. The flame went up high. Right then, my dad called us down for dinner and you have to go past a wall to get in the kitchen so we went to eat at the table thinking that our friends were going to wait upstairs for us. My sister Jessie got done eating before me so she went up there to see if they were there so we could continue talking with candles. She went up there and she heard like two girls bickering or talking. And she ran down stairs and ran over to Heathers, my friend across the street. I got done eating, I went up there to continue doing the candle thing. I heard two girls whispering and I thought it was Jenna and Heather, trying to creep my out so I said ""ha ha guys that's just hilarious!"" and they kept talking. So I said ""seriously guys, come out this isn't funny anymore"" and they didn't, so we started looking all over the room, in every corner, under the bed, every possible place to hide. They weren't there. I was so scared I could hear my heart pounding. I jumped all the way down the stairs (almost broke my legs). I asked my parents where jessie was. They told me she went over to Heathers. There was only my dad and mom in the house at the time and you cannot hear then from upstairs. So I came to a conclusion it must have been ghosts. It scared the crap outta me. I ran as fast as I could over to Heathers. Right when I knocked on the door, Jessie told me really fast her story, you could tell she was scared. and I said  ""OH MY GOSH same here!"". Now, we never go upstairs, it scares the crap outta us.

We have a gravestone in our backyard, it's old and you can't see what the writing says. We suspect it is the person haunting our house.

Ghost Ruining my Party,"Ohio, United States",Apparitions / Voices / Touches,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Apparitions / Voices / Touches :: Ghost Ruining my Party

I t was 12:00 at night and me and my friend Amanda had just got out of the shower (we have 2 showers). My parents were gone for the weekend in Hawaii. Amanda and I decided we would throw an awesome party that night. We invited the whole freshman class. Let's face it, a party isn't really a cool party in high school unless it has beer and alcohol.  I gave Amanda the keys to go out in the garage to get it. She went out there and I heard a scream and shatters of glass. Amanda ran in and told me with very low breath that she saw a see-through man wearing all black. I said it was ok, I told her she was probably just seeing things. So I went out to get the beer. I saw nothing. I got chips out, put it in bowls and a whole bunch of things out for the party.

People finally started showing up. We turned the music up real loud and everyone was dancing and having a ball and some people were up stairs. All of a sudden, my friend Heather came down the stairs with a white face. She said she was going to the bathroom and she came out and walked through a man wearing all black. We told her it was ok and we sat down with her on the couch for a while. She decided to go home, Heather said she was to creeped. Now everything was ok and going great and I saw this man sitting on my couch. He was acting all ""I'm a freshman chilling on the couch"". Nobody really noticed. Most were drunk I guess... I saw him. I told him to get out of my house. No response from him. So I called some boys over and they said ""what are you talking about, there is no one there. I think you are drunk Brigitte. It's ok, just sit down for a little and stop drinking."" I wasn't even drinking though! I told them and they were treating me like they couldn't even hear me. So I just got over it, I didn't wanna ruin the party. I mean, if I had a sweet party, I would become the main ""squeese"" in school so I just went along and danced with some friends.

Until Amanda saw him again. She came to me screaming and yelling, huffing and puffing. I tried to comfort her and I decided I wouldn't let him ruin my party. So I asked him ""please! go and don't ruin my party!"". I can't believe I did it, I was so scared. He just disappeared right in front of me. I thought it was all cool, so I started dancing again and I saw him looking in the window at me.  I just ignored him. I kept seeing him but I didn't care, I just wanted to be cool at school until a boy, the most popular hot boy in school, saw him. I told him he was just seeing things even though I really could see him. Everyone of course believed him. He left. So everyone else left except about 5 people. ButI just sent them home because the party was no longer fun.

I wasn't exactly cool at school but the most popular boy Eric now paid more attention to me and Amanda. I didn't see the ghost again since then, so I think he just wanted to ruin my fun. I asked my parents if anyone died in this house or anything about it when they came home.  Only I didn't tell then about the party (I think I will just wait until I move out and they cant ground me). They told me that the people before us got murdered in this house and that's why we got it so cheap.

The Walls,"Illinois, United States",Apparitions / Voices / Touches,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Apparitions / Voices / Touches :: The Walls

O ne day, I was home alone with my little cousin, Colleen, while her mom was at the store. I hadn't showered that day, so I told her I was going to take a shower and that I'd be back in 30 minutes. About 10 minutes into my shower, Colleen came bursting through the door, crying hysterically. She said that she had been watching T.V when the walls started to talk to her. I asked her what they had said and she replied, ""They called you a bitch."" Now, Colleen had never heard vulgar language before, as we never swore in front of her, so I was a little shocked. I put on a towel, went downstairs, and hit the wall. ""Bad wall,"" I said as I ""spanked"" the wall. ""Now what are they saying,"" I asked her. ""Now they're laughing at you ... "".

Since then I have moved out of that house and my sister currently lives there. She hasn't heard or seen anything weird, but I still refuse to go back in that house.

Strange Things Happening in my Apartment,Guam,Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: Strange Things Happening in my Apartment

H ere in Guam, I live in an apartment with my parents. Sometimes, very strange things happen and it's as if I feel a presence with me.

Every night, my dad always goes outside to check on my rabbits and usually knocks on my window because he needs my bedroom light to check on them. Well, one night around 8:30, I was watching TV in my room when someone was knocking on my window. I opened it a few minutes later and no one was there. I thought maybe it was my dad and that he already went back inside since I didn't open my window right away. So I went to the living room and asked if he'd just went outside but he said he didn't! I told my mom and she hadn't been outside either! I was getting a little freaked, but I just ignored it. When I got back in my room, the knocking was there again! I opened the window as fast as I could, and no one was there at all!

Another time was when I was also watching TV alone in my room. All of a sudden, I heard a low singing voice. It was a girl's voice. I looked around and saw a girl in white sitting at the top of my bunk bed!

This one happened while I was asleep. As I woke up, I felt kind of drowsy and then I just had this strange feeling like something went inside me. I then heard voices singing and saying ""Wake up!"" My window was open at the time and thinking it was my neighbors, I looked outside but no one was there. Then, the thing that ""entered"" me left and the voices were gone too. After that, I ran out to my mom.

Here's one that happened about three days ago. I was using the computer and then, the chair just started shaking so hard! I thought there was some earthquake but as I looked around, nothing else was moving. The chair was going crazy! When I put my hands under to see what was happening, it stopped. This was in our living room and my mom was right there but she didn't even notice!

So, what do you guys think? Is there someone else in my home?

The Little Girl in the Window,Ireland,Apparitions / Voices / Touches,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Apparitions / Voices / Touches :: The Little Girl in the Window

I was about 13 or 14, and yes odd stuff always happens to me. No one in my family believe in ghosts at all. I went to stay in my cousin's house for two nights, her birthday party was the day after the first night there. Her house was very old, cold, and it was built in the late 19th century. However, I wasn't expecting anything weird to happen, because she has loads of sisters and brothers who were everywhere in the house, but this happened in the early hours of the morning.

When you went up stairs, there is still a window where the other conservatory is built on, but this window has no glass so you can look into it or climb in to the other room, but you don't use it as a door. Well, the room I had to stay in was facing this window.

I fell asleep, and the covers where falling off me when I woke up at around 4:00 in the morning. I couldn't go back to sleep, so I just laid in the bed looking around the room, and outside on the landing. It was pitch black and the only sign of light was from the back yard lantern shining through the glass opposite the window facing me. I didn't even notice her, but she was there all the time as I was awake for about 45 minutes. I knew she was there because I could see her but it never clicked with me. When I came around, I glanced, and then it clicked. Who's that? I thought to myself, standing there, looking at me, was a tiny child looking around 5 or 6. She looked terrified, and she was frozen, pale and her mouth was open and she looked like she was going to break down crying or even scream. As usual, I crawled over the bed to the door and slammed it shut, put the light on, and got my mobile to try and see if my friends where awake, it makes me feel better.

I Saw my Dead Grandpa!,Canada,Family / Friends Visits,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Family / Friends Visits :: I Saw my Dead Grandpa!

I t was late at night February 4th, 2001. My grandpa had been very sick lately, so we put him in the hospital. That night, I could not fall asleep, for I was worried for my poor grandpa. But then, I heard a loud banging coming from under my bed. Like any kid, I just  laid in bed with the blankets over my head. I finally fell asleep and had a dream I was drowning. The only thing I saw while I was drowning was a figure coming from the sky. It got closer and closer and it looked more and more like my grandpa! He picked me up and let me out of the water and told me to be strong, but I didn't know what he was talking about. He said I have to help take care of my mom and other family members.

I woke up in fright, not knowing what was going on. I looked on the other side of the bed and there was my grandpa smiling at me and stroking my hair. Kissing me good night, he softly said he loves me and that I have to stay away from a guy name Max Gibbison. He than faded away. Early that morning, I heard mom crying, saying grandpa died that night at 11:48pm!

My Friend Sally,"California, United States",Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: My Friend Sally

M y name is Ana and this happened to me when I was around 9 years old. I moved from Japan to LA when I was 7 with my two older brothers and sister, my little brother Jun and our mom. (My parents weren't divorced. My dad had to stay back because of his job but arrived a year later.)

One day, my mom, Matthew, and Catalyn, (siblings, the two oldest) all went grocery shopping while Jun, Ron and I stayed home. Jun and I were playing when I felt someone pull my hair. I thought it was him so I hit him back and got in trouble from Ron. I told him what happened and he just ignored it. So did I.

The next day, when in my parents' room looking for paper to draw on, a little girl about my age that time, appeared in the doorway. She had brown hair in pigtails and was wearing a knee-length white dress. We just stood there looking at each other. Then she walked away without a word. I remembered we had some company that day so when they left, I asked my mom if that was their daughter but she had no idea what I was talking about. I argued and gave up because my mom was getting annoyed.

Two days after, when I was watching TV in the living room, Catalyn came to me and said my friend was waiting at the door for me I said ""What friend? I don't know anyone here."" Then she pulled me and dragged me to the door where there was no one. She was confused but then said ""She was there earlier."" I asked her what the girl looked like and she described the girl I had seen when I was in my parents' bedroom. Now, my curiosity was getting to me. And being young that time, I never really feared anything and the word ""GHOST"" never came to my mind either. I told myself the next time that girl showed up, I'd try to talk to her and ask why she was following me.

Three weeks passed and I hadn't seen the girl. Until the next day. I went to my brother Jun and Ron, who were both in Matthew's room looking for some video game. I just stayed there because I wanted to. While they were searching, I saw the girl in my brother's bed! Jun and Ron didn't see her because they were looking in the closet. Then I just yelled ""Hey! Why do you keep following me? Do you want something?"" My brothers asked who I was yelling at, but I ignored them. The girl was leaving and I followed her to my room. I tried talking to her. To my surprise, she talked back. She said that she was dead and that this  used to be her house. She, and her mother and father were murdered by her older sister because her parents always favored her more. Even though their parents loved them the same. She told me she misses her sister even though jealousy is what made her dead. (Her sister is still alive.) When she finished, I couldn't believe my ears. I said I didn't believe her and that this was joke. I then said ""What's your name and why have you been following me? You know, this is a very good joke you're playing, 'Cause you're already creeping me out."" She said ""I'm Sally. This isn't a joke. I'm a ghost. I'll prove it to you."" After that, she walked through my wall and then came back. Now, I was getting scared. I was having an actual conversation with a ghost. I wanted to scream, but then I said ""Aren't ghosts usually mean? Why are you so nice?"" She told me that she was nice and all she wanted was a friend. I found out through her that we're the third residents of this house and that whenever she tried making friends with some of the other kids, they'd get scared. Then the family would end up moving out.

Well, now I'm 13, and from that day, I wasn't afraid of Sally anymore because I knew she meant no harm. She became my ""friend"" and we always talk, even though I'm the only one who knows about her.

A Child Haunting in North Highlands,"California, United States",Ghost Hunting,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Ghost Hunting :: A Child Haunting in North Highlands

A s I left my home, I threw on the X-Files theme song, because I knew I was headed for a ghost hunt. This time around I engaged my ghost hunting activities with the S.P.S. (Sacramento Paranormal Society). I drove to Donovan Turner's home. Donovan Turner is the founder/paranormal investigator/leader of S.P.S. His wife Melissa is the case manager. The day is the 24th of February, the year 2007. The time is 1700 hours. I prepare for my briefing from Donovan. Paranormal Investigation Team roll call included: Donovan Turner, Jason Kowing/Equipment Handler/Intuitive, Deona Joya ""DJ"" Vastine-Sharp, Janet Michalk/Intuitive, Paul Dale Roberts/Ghost Writer. Location of the haunted home is somewhere in North Highlands in Sacramento County. The occupants of this home wish to remain anonymous. The equipment we are bringing for this investigation are as follows: infrared camera; standard mobile infrared camera; stationary infrared camera; VHS recorder; tripod; temperature gauge; EMF detection meter; digital recorders and sealed recording tapes that are sealed and a witness is used for the opening of the tapes and the sealing of the completed tapes.

The briefing consisted of who the occupants were of the home, the location of home, what their religious beliefs are, how long they lived at this address, which was 1 year and 3 months and many other questions that were provided to the occupants of the home. The occupants related in the questionnaire that they smell cigarette smoke in the house and no one is allowed to smoke in the house, in fact cigarette ashes have been found near the toilet. They heard loud bangs from the pots in the kitchen. Their small child had blankets moved off of him. The blankets moved from the bed to the floor on its own. The whole family sleeps in the living room together, because they are afraid of their own home surroundings.

19:28 hours, we arrive at the residence. The ominous clouds have turned into a rain storm with winds blowing. I think to myself...'ahh, what a great night for a ghost hunt!' We set up equipment in the garage, various teams go into the house at various intervals. Janet uses her E.V.P. (Electronic Voice Phenomenon) device and her intuitive instincts to track any presences in the home. Jason in front of me uses his EMF detector and registers no spikes in the garage. So far everything is normal.

The mother and daughter of this home, explain how they have seen shadows crossing the walls, cigarette ashes found in and around the toilet area and the distinct smell of cigarette smoke in the bathroom. She goes on to explain that in the master bedroom, objects have moved on their own accord, such as hats or a basket. We set up a still infrared camera in the master bedroom to see if any objects will move. The mother goes on to explain how the TV has shut off on it's own and then came back on and at times the channels change. In the kitchen she has heard the freezer door open and the jiggling of ice cubes. On the stove is a picture on a stand and the stand is knocked off on its own, the daughter and mother have witnessed the knocking down of the picture in the picture frame.

At 20:01 hours, Donovan and Jason is the first team into the house, they walk into the son's bedroom. The room is warm and then at some point of time, they walk into a cold spot. The cold spot lasts for about 2 to 3 seconds, the air felt thick at this time. Jason explains on how his voice recorder had a new battery and the battery was instantly drained. Could this have happened because of spirit activity? Janet & DJ do a walk through, Janet the intuitive feels the following:

a) When entering kitchen she is drawn to the sink, she feels a presence there. In her head, she feels she is being told to look into the backyard, she calls it a 'knowing'.

b) In living room, she felt nothing, while walking in the hallway, she is compelled to go into the master bedroom, she says it's a decisive heaviness in the air, pressure drops in the room, she finds it hard to breathe, there is distress in her voice, there is a tightening to her solar plexus and she feels a slight pain to the right side of her stomach area.

c) In the master bedroom, she feels something old, she is drawn to the hairbrush and hand held mirror. She detects an 'add-on' in the bedroom. In the 'add-on' section, she detects no presence, in the older part of the bedroom, she feels a presence, in fact she claims to detect 3 entities. The atmosphere of the bedroom goes from heavy to light. Heavy in the older section, lighter in the add-on section. In the little boy's bedroom, she feels energy. In the bathroom, she senses giggling. She believes the spirit is young. Other comments from the team, is that the spirit is of a little boy.

Janet feels a pain on her left side of her torso. She tries to entice the spirit from the garage area, with me present. While Janet explains to me what she felt inside the house, she feels a tingle on her shoulders. She explains that when a sensitive walks into a haunted home, the spirits are immediately drawn to her, she is like their light. She explained to me feeling body pain, twitching of shoulder area, shortness of breath, because the entities of this home recognize her as a sensitive or intuitive.

Paul and Jason use an Olympus digital voice recorder as they enter the home. We are the next team up. The video camera shuts down twice on its own, for no apparent reason. When DJ was outside taking a break, she felt a presence, she felt like someone was standing on the right side of her. She felt warmth draping part of her back area and then it was gone. Janet approaches DJ and was able to describe where the incident took place at. Janet felt like something was near them. At 20:45 hours, Donovan witnesses garage door that leads into the home opening and closing on its own accord. I investigate to see if possibly an open draft could have done it, but the door is too heavy and when it closes, it stays closed, no wind could have opened it, let alone close it again.

Next team is Donovan and I. We investigate the master bedroom, we detect nothing. Then we go into the boy's bedroom and things start happening. Well, they start happening for me anyway. I use the temperature gauge and detect a spike, from 91 to 65 in a matter of seconds in the same area. One area remains at 65. I place my hand in that area and feel a cold spot and then before my very eyes, a small orb, the size of a pinhead floats up for about 1 foot in length and dissipates. I couldn't believe it. This was my first experience in this home!

The intuitives Jason and Janet relate the following. Jason: That there was a spirit of a little boy in the house, over 5 years of age. Maybe Portuguese or Filipino. There was also a grown man ghost in the house. This man ghost was frustrated or sad. The little boy was playful and enjoyed playing tricks. Janet: There was a little boy in the house, about age 7. Little boy had dark skin. He was playful. She also felt like there was a relative of the family in the house and that he had been shot, the family of the house confirmed that what Janet said was true. Janet felt shivers, discomfort and she almost felt like crying. She couldn't explain it, but she felt a sense of sadness in this house. Janet believes their are 3 entities in the home, but the 3rd one was never identified.

When the investigation was over around the time of midnight and as I drove home in this stormy night, I couldn't help wonder what was in store of this family. A family that was happy to have us around, they felt safe with us at their home and even wanted us to stay the whole evening, so they could get a peaceful sleep. I remember the paranormal investigative reporter named Kolchak: The Night Stalker of the once hit TV show and how he would encounter so many things of the paranormal. Everything from werewolves to vampires to ghosts. Everything he encountered was of the negative. But, can most hauntings be of the positive? I didn't feel any negativity in this home and I believe this family is relatively safe. After Donovan briefed the family of our findings and how he will do a follow-up from the audio/video tapes, there was a glowing smile on the mother's face. She felt more at ease, especially with the comforting of Janet's soothing words. As I approach my home, wouldn't you know it, on my car radio, the song ""Werewolves of London by Warren Zevon"" starts to play!

New House Apparition,Ireland,Apparitions / Voices / Touches,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Apparitions / Voices / Touches :: New House Apparition

M e and my family recently moved, it was just the day before christmas eve in 2006. I have finally moved out of that house where I saw my brother's guardian , and where I saw other strange things or should I say, heard. What happened isn't at all an over the top phenomenon, but it really scared me anyway.

From the day I moved in, I felt no strange presence, because I could always feel a presence in my old home, so I wasn't at all scared. This house is older then my old one, by about 50 odd years. This happened just last week, on 20/2/2007. It was around 3:25pm, my mom and dad had gone out to get shopping, pay the bills etc. My little brother had gone with them. My older brother had gone out to spend the day with his girlfriend, and I was at home with our dog Max, who he was asleep. I, however, was busy getting ready to go to work for 4:00pm. I had a shower, and the last thing I needed to do was find my working clothes. My mom had washed them, she always puts them somewhere to dry them off, but I couldn't find them, so I was running around the house. The stairway in our house is very dreary looking, because the only light is from a rounded window, from the type of glass that would be in a bathroom, and in our sitting room, we have a conservatory bedroom attached, it was my mom and dads. This room has no windows with a door less closet. My mom got the dandly beads to put on it rather then a door.

I ran into her room, and looked on all the radiators to see if I could find the clothes. Then I stopped in my tracks and freezed. It was so weird, because it just suddenly happened. I got the strangest feeling I was being watched, the same feeling I always got in my old home. I decided to look somewhere else, and quickly walked out of the room. I finally found my clothes, and I got rid of that feeling at last. However, just as I was walking out the door to work, I realized I left my phone on my bed. I turned behind me and quickly went to run up the stairs (I was watching my feet while running, like charging), and just as I reached the top, I looked for a second, and right there, it was like a flash, a figure I couldn't make out had been peeping around the top of the stairway at me, but quickly went away as I moved my head up. It was like playing hide and seek, because of the way it was looking out. Just the head. but all I saw was black, no eyes, I couldn't make out a face, I got the feeling it was a person though, right away.

I ran back down and right out the door to work. One day without the phone is no harm. I told my brother's girlfriend, because she believes in ghosts like me, my own family wouldn't care less about it.

The Car Accident,"California, United States",Family / Friends Visits,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Family / Friends Visits :: The Car Accident

M y cousin, his best friend and their girlfriends were taking a road trip from California to Wisconsin several years ago.  My cousin and his girlfriend sat in the back of the small Honda Hatchback.  The next thing he remembered was waking up in a hospital room.  His friend and his girlfriend were standing by his side.  He asked them why he's the only one injured.  His friend said he was the lucky one and smiled at him.  His girlfriend said she'd be waiting for him when he gets out.  There was a knock at the door and the friend and his girlfriend dashed through the hospital window.

In walked his parents, followed by my parents and me.  We were so happy to see him finally awake because they had a real bad car accident.  He looked at me and asked if I had seen the others with him.  His mother burst into tears.  I didn't know how to answer him so I said, ""They're in a better place now.""  He gave me a real confused look and said his friends just came to visit him and that they went through the window.  I was real scared, I told him that we were on the forth floor of the hospital and that he was the only survivor.  The DR was never able to explain if what he saw was due to his head injury or if he in fact saw it.

The Devil Riding my Back,"Texas, United States",Old Hags / Night Attacks / Sleep Paralysis,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Old Hags / Night Attacks / Sleep Paralysis :: The Devil Riding my Back

E ver since I was young, I have always been told about the devil riding your back but never believed it. This event happened 7 years ago, I was then 12, going on 13. I woke up one night and I couldn't move. I felt a weight on me, but saw no one, the only thing I can do was look around. Lord knows if I was able to move, I would have ran to my parents room. As I continued to look, I saw nothing, no shadow, nothing. That particular night, it was a full moon and I could see the light from the moon lighting up my room from my window above my bed. I did all I could to move and scream, but still no luck. I was so terrified that I started to say my prayers in cambodian and I also recited a chant in my head, from which I learned from my great grandfather who was a monk. Minutes after that, I felt the weight lift off me and terrified as I was, I jumped up and turned all the lights on and looked at my clock, 3:00 almost 4:00 in the morning. I thought to myself, for 10 scary minutes I was stuck. I told my parents the next day but they looked at me in disbelief. Months passed, nothing happened to me, I continued to sleep in that room. But one summer day, my mom decided to take a nap in my room. The same thing that happened to me happened to her, but in daylight. She refuses to talk about it. I still don't know what the hell it was, just some people's opinion saying it was the devil riding my back.

The Lilydale Police Officer,"Minnesota, United States",Misc,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Misc :: The Lilydale Police Officer

M y brother picked me from work one night.  It was a Friday night, we were getting ready to hit the clubs and meet some friends.  To hype us, he cranked up the volume and turned on the bass in the car. We were dancing and being really rowdy.  The next thing I knew, red and blue lights were flashing behind us from a really far distance.  My brother saw it too, so he lowered the sound and hit the gas to get away from the cop.  Within a blink of an eye, the police car caught up with us already.  He pulled us over for loud music.  I was too afraid of hearing a lecture from my parents that I didn't pay attention to the cop.  My brother was swearing the entire time, for sure my parents were going to take away our driving privileges.

We didn't go out that night. We kept this away from my parents. I worked my butt off to pay for that ticket.  That Friday when I got my paycheck, we headed right away to the courthouse to pay for the ticket.  When we got there to the front desk, the lady said we could pay for it with her.  I was pulling out money to pay for the ticket then suddenly the lady was laughing.  She said I didn't need to pay for it because the police officer who gave us the ticket have been dead for a long time on Lily Dale Drive.  She said there's a lot of people who come time to time to pay for tickets issued by this deceased officer and she still get amused from it.

This is Lilydale in the Twin Cities MN area, have anyone heard about this or had any experiences related to this officer?

A Message to my Mother,Ireland,Family / Friends Visits,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Family / Friends Visits :: A Message to my Mother

O ne night, me and my mom were talking about ghosts, and whether or not she believes in them. She told me this story. Years and years ago, when I was very little, my mom and dad didn't get on very well, mostly because his mother didn't approve of her. One day, my mom couldn't find my father anywhere, so she went over to his mother, and she said angrily ""He's gone away from you! for good, and that's all I have to say to you"", and she slammed the door in my mom's face. Weeks past, and my mom was in despair. She said that her and her own mother were best friends, and at the time, she wished her mother had been there to help her through the situation. But both her father and mother were dead about 5 years at that time.

One night she had a dream she was walking down a lain way, the one to her childhood house, and she said her mother was at the end of the lain. Her mother spoke to her and said ""don't worry about anything, he has just gone away on sea but he will be back shortly, don't worry about the kids"". She woke up, and on that day, my dad came knocking on the door. He then told my mom where he had been. ""I was in London with my brothers"" he said. Of course, there was no particular reason why he should have gone, I think he was seeing another woman, well at least I think that's what his mother thought, and to this day, my mom remembers that dream she had, so now I feel a little better when I tell her about all the strange things that do go on.

Voices,British Indian Ocean Territory,Apparitions / Voices / Touches,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Apparitions / Voices / Touches :: Voices

I currently work on a tropical island that some people would pay to be at, but it's a military base and only those who work or are stationed here are allowed. The island has a rich history and it has its ghost stories as well. I have only experienced one kind of paranormal event while here, but I am planning on checking into the validity of the other stories I will tell here. My own experience has been with voices. I have clearly heard my named called on several occasions and there is no one around me at the time. I have also caught the movement of what some of you call shadow people out of the corner of my eye in my room. I do not get the feeling that these are bad or negative energies, but something that is trying to communicate its presence to me.

The next story was relayed to me, by another island resident, of the angry Philipino. It seems that these two ladies who worked the midnight shift out on the far side of the island were standing outside their facility smoking and talking, when, out of nowhere, a Philipino man came running and screaming at them. Needless to say they both started to run back into the facility and as they reached the door, they looked back and he was gone. Their facility is a secure location and the only way in is through a locked gate that only employees of that location have access to. They claimed this happened several times.

The next story is of the woman in white, also told by another island resident. It is said that over on the far side of the island at the old plantation, if you spend the night, you will see a woman in white victorian dress wondering the grounds. No one knows who she is or why she is there. I plan on finding out if this one is true. Who knows maybe I will come back with some pictures to post here. There are a couple of more stories that supposedly happen here, but I will have to sit down and have them told to me again so that I can pass them on to you along with anything I find during my ghost hunt.

Friends Visiting in Dream,United Kingdom,Family / Friends Visits,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Family / Friends Visits :: Friends Visiting in Dream

A bout a month ago, my baby daughter was in  hospital with bronchitis and I stayed over in hospital with her. I was very distressed about her situation and I cried constantly in hospital. That evening, I fell asleep and I saw in my dream an old friend of mine that had died ten years ago. Her head was completely bald, the reason of this is that she had cancer and had treatment. In my dream, I was upset about my baby and she came up to me and gave me a hug, she looked so pale but never said a word and then I woke up. I think she was reassuring me that everything was going to be ok. I have never had anything close to a ghostly encounters other than this, but I'm sure that when we are all distressed about something, we are visited by friends or family members beyond this earth.

The Man Outside,"Virginia, United States",,"I was home alone with my older sister. We where watching t.v. when my sister decided she was hungry so she went to the kitchen. I was left alone on the couch. All of a sudden, the lights started to flicker. Jordan came running and screaming out of the kitchen and I was a little freaked out too. She said she saw someone walking around outside. It wasn't the first time someone said they saw someone outside. For my birthday, my friends came over for a sleep over. I was asleep when they woke me up screaming. I told them to shut up, that my parents are asleep. They told me there was someone walking around outside. it was about 2:00 in the morning. I told them to forget about it, so we went back to sleep. I never told my mom. But a few months later, my mom went to take my dog out of the bathroom. It was rainy and cold, around 2:00 in the morning. She saw a man outside walking. He was pale and glowing a white tint. I live out in the country, no one would walk around out at night. From that day on I am scared to go outside at night.

A Man and a Dog,"Virginia, United States",Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: A Man and a Dog

I think my house is haunted. About 7 or 6 years ago, my grandpa passed away in my house from cancer. In 2006, my dog max was hit by a car and died. Before this happened, every thing was fine. One time, I was sleeping and something tapped me so across. I woke up, looked and saw a tall man wearing jeans and a blue sweater. I blinked my eyes, I looked again and it just vanished. Another time I was outside waiting for my other dog. I was calling bailiy and there was this black dog, you could kind of make out the shape, it's hard to describe. I thought it was bailiy, she's black too, so I started to run to the dog but it vanished. I ran inside and there was bailiy. The other day, I was upstairs and watching t.v. and I felt something furry go against my leg. That's the 2nd thing happening to me when I am getting up to go to the bathroom. Another time, it was day light and again I was watching t.v. downstairs. This man walked across the window, so I ran outside to see who he was. I saw him and I yelled ""hey!"" but he vanished into thin air. I think it was my grandpa and my dog max's ghost.

Ghost in Apartment,"Florida, United States",Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: Ghost in Apartment

I always thought that the apartment that my husband and I were living in was haunted. All he did was call me crazy, but all the time I heard noises from the kitchen and the door opening and closing. So I always just ignored it but one day, my husband and I were going to go out for a while. He told me that he would be home soon when I spoke to him on the phone. I was taking a shower and I got dressed and I was doing my make-up when I heard the door open and then close. I said ""Hi honey, I'm almost ready"". Then I heard something in the kitchen and it was the sound of unwrapping tin foil. And then I heard the microwave beep as if my husband was cooking leftovers. But when I finished my make-up, I went downstairs and I didn't see my husband!

The Girl in my Room,"Florida, United States",Apparitions / Voices / Touches,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Apparitions / Voices / Touches :: The Girl in my Room

O ne day I was up in my room, doing homework. I went back to get a snack. I came back and my room was a mess. I was sure I was alone. So I cleaned up my room and did my homework. I am an only child, so nobody could of done this.  By 10:00 pm, I was in my room watching Family Guy. I heard a noise from under my bed. Unlike most kids, I looked under my bed. I didn't see anything, so I went back to my show. But this time the noise came from a closet. I went to my closet and there was a little girl! I started to talk to her. She said this was her house when she was a girl. I asked her why she was in my house. No response. I asked her if this was a joke and she said no. She said that my time to leave is near. I started freaking out. She said that she will be back in the morning. Then she was gone. I never saw her after that (thank goodness). But I am still creeped to this day!

The Backdoor,"Texas, United States",Apparitions / Voices / Touches,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Apparitions / Voices / Touches :: The Backdoor

O ne time, I was at my friend's house. There was me and my 3 other friends, shay, sarah and ashley. Me and shay were in her room, sarah was on the couch in the living room and ashley was in the kitchen. The door to the garage is in the kitchen and the way that the couch is sitting, it is facing the back door. The back door was locked and the broom was up against the door handle. My friend's dog started barking (he sleeps in the garage) and sarah ran to the hallway. Ashley was frozen and I ran into the kitchen, just as the broom fell and the door opened. Sarah was already gone. We got scared and shay, sarah and ashley started to cry. We ran by shay's mom's door and stood there because we knew we would get in trouble if we woke her up. She woke up and told us everything was ok and went to bed. We were still scared, so we sat on the couch staring at the door. We saw a figure in the window walking back and forth (in the garage) so we got scared and ran by her door again. Of course, we got in trouble but we didn't care, she said that everything is ok and the doors shrink when its cold. She went back to sleep again. We didn't believe her so we slept in shay's closet (it takes up the whole wall).

The next day, we asked shay's step dad if doors shrink when its cold and he said no. We told him that's what becky said (shay's mom) and then he obviously remembered becky telling him something about that and said ""Oh well, they do, I forgot!"". We didn't believe him!

The Shadow,"Texas, United States",Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: The Shadow

I was around 12 years old or so and I had spent the night at my mother's (I lived with my grandma but I go to my mom's when it's the weekend) and everyone in the house was asleep. I was sleeping in the living room and it was dark (not that dark because of the light that was in the kitchen) and I woke up at around 5:00 am. I heard a voice and it told me to leave the house and it sounded like it was right next to me. I was so scared that I stayed up until I fell asleep again. Then, I heard footsteps on the floor and I looked and I thought that it was my step-dad going to the restroom but instead of going to the restroom, it was going after me. I shouted my mother's name and the shadow disappeared and my mom came running into the living room. I told her about it and she just said that we would talk about it in the morning.

We both went to sleep and in the morning, my mother told me that the house was haunted!

Shadow People,"Alaska, United States",Old Hags / Night Attacks / Sleep Paralysis,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Old Hags / Night Attacks / Sleep Paralysis :: Shadow People

M ost people who read this will remember my story about the incident at the river ... well, this is just one of the recurring encounters that I have in my bedroom every night without fail.

Every night, when I get into my room to sleep, (which I never really get a chance to do) I will always find something that I keep on a top shelf sitting in the middle of my bed. After I put it away and lay down, I'll start hearing what sounds like whispers. I can never really tell what they're saying, but every now and again, I hear my name being mentioned, like a group of people are talking about me or something. I have a habit of lifting my head slighting and opening my eyes a little, just to check and make sure nobody is standing there and I'll always see four shadowed figures at the end of my bed staring at me. If I try to open my eyes all the way and stare at them head on, they disappear, so I've learned to watch them out the corner of my eye.

They continue speaking and looking at me like they are trying to decide what to do. At this point, I usually get a really bad feeling that whatever they decide, it isn't going to be in my best interest, but I make myself lay there and wait, thinking, every night, maybe something will change. When they seem to make up their mind, the one standing directly opposite to me will reach out and grab my ankles. And yes, I can feel hands gripping me, then I feel the shadow start to pull me down the bed towards it and when another shadowed figure, who I can never notice beforehand, no matter how hard I try, suddenly will lean over me and start to whisper angrily at them.

They always let me go, and they always disappear after that. If anybody has any idea what I should do, or whatever these things might be, please let me know because it is starting to drive me a little nuts. Other things happen after that, like footsteps and hisses, and it has gotten to the point where I've started to sleep in my parent's room with my mom the first half of the night, just to get some sleep.

Hearing  Footsteps,Canada,Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: Hearing  Footsteps

I n 1989, my aunt lived in a older house and there had been strange things that would happen there. She heard footsteps going up her staircase, both day and night, and it would happen off and on. Once, her niece stayed the night and wasn't aware of any of this! Her aunt didn't want to scare her. When her niece went to get ready for bed upstairs... she suddenly heard footsteps and they walked into another bedroom and the door closed shut! She thought it was her aunt. She asked ""Is that you, aunt Nancy?"". She got no response!

The next morning, she asked her aunt if she had come up the stairs around that time she was getting ready for bed. Her aunt said ""No!"". Her niece was a bit scared and then said ""I heard footsteps... who was it?"" Her aunt answered ""Oh, that's old Charley walking around! He once lived here before me! And he died a few years ago."" My aunt wasn't scared and just accepted it. But her niece sure was scared! She never stayed over night at her aunt's home again!

A Song of Innocence,"Texas, United States",Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: A Song of Innocence

I have lived in my current residence for a little over 6 years now. It's a small, costly, yellow brick house.  It has a rather large back yard. The first night I stayed there, I had strange dreams about a young girl.  She was no younger than at least 6.  I only had these dreams for a day or two, but much stranger things began to happen in my conscious world that soon terrified me.

I'm a person who loves to sing.  So on a sunny day, home alone, doing some chores, I start to sing aloud to my self.  I'm walking around the house singing while I'm doing laundry and things.  After a while I start humming, then I completely stop singing.  No more than 5 minutes after I stopped, I started to hear the same song I was singing, faintly in my attic.  I stopped what I was doing and started to listen.  The voice was much higher than mine, so I could tell she was a little girl.  The song started to get louder.  I started to freak, then remembered the girl in my dreams. Remembering what my step-father had told me about spirits, I reacted.  He believed that if you told them to go, calmly and unafraid, they would for compelled to leave you.  I started to think, and say aloud, ""Leave me, you are not wanted here."" Soon the voice got fainter, and the song faded from the house.

Still to this day, occasionally when I'm alone, I'll sing to my self.  No voice is heard, no song of innocence. The girl had left my home, but resided in my mind from then on.

The Pink Pumps,"California, United States",Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: The Pink Pumps

W e lived in a very old and big house back when we were young.  Young, as I was in pre-school and my eldest sibling was in the forth grade. My siblings and I loved wearing my mother's pink high heels.  Whenever I wore it, I'd pretend I was a famous tap dancer because the pumps made a beautiful clink sound against our hardwood flooring (or at least it was beautiful in our ears at that time).  My mother, of course, thought it was most annoying and often scolds at me to stop many times in a day.  My siblings and I took turns wearing those pink pumps around the house, anywhere that would make a clink clunk noise.

One day, my brother wore the pumps up and down the stairs.  He wanted to show us that he had mad skills and was able to walk without tripping on the steps.  After going up and down several times, he took off the shoes and left it on the top of the stairs then ran down.  My sister took a try, coming down and up then down again.  She left the pumps on the bottom of the steps.  When my turn came, I was able to only walk with the shoes up the stairs until I heard my mom yelling from the kitchen for us not to play with her shoes because we're going to trip and crack our heads falling down the steps.  So I left the shoes on top of the stairs and ran down to join the others.

The three of us were watching TV in the den while my mom was still in the kitchen, cooking away.  Then suddenly, we heard a clunking sound coming from the top of the stairs.  The noise came closer.  We all went over to the stairs to check and it was my mom's pink pumps.  They were on the bottom of the steps. I know for sure they were on the top of the steps when I left them.  We were all puzzled.

We went back to the den.  A couple of minutes later, we heard the noise again. So we all ran back to the steps and found the pink pumps going up and down the steps, all by itself as if an invisible person was doing it.  I was so shocked, even for a little kid, I stood there looking at the shoes with amazement.  My mom yelled from the kitchen telling us to knock it off.  We all screamed and hid behind my mom.  We told her what happened.

When she went to check, the shoes stopped moving. I hate it when ghosts play tricks on the little kids and have no effect on adults.

The Evil Spirit by the Mango Tree,Cambodia,Misc,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Misc :: The Evil Spirit by the Mango Tree

I n Cambodia, it has been said that if you walk at night during a certain hour, you shouldn't think of anything evil or else it will happen! A group of kids was hungry (this was during khmer rouge regime) so they decided to go look for food in the woods. There was a mango tree with a lot of fresh mangos. Everyone decided to climb it and picked the fruits. Suddenly, one the kids yelled ghost! Within that second, all the kids jumped down and ran. While running, one boy says don't look back. But not listening, my aunt looked back and saw a lady in white with long hair that touched the ground and a face so demonic, you will never forget. Terrified, everyone continued to run like hell. My aunt, being the last one, fell and one of her friends came and helped herup. They all ran back to the village screaming and crying. A couple of days went by and my aunt became very ill. So ill that her hair was falling off and she was completely bald. Months went by, she lost so much weight that people in the village suggested that she see a witch doctor (one that heals from evil spirits). The doctor came and told her parents the reason for her being sick was that she saw the spirit and that spirit cursed  her to be sick and to see evil things no 8 year old was supposed to see. The doctor healed her completely. He also explained that the spirit was a lady who committed suicide while 7 months pregnant because he husband left her for another woman. So by that mango tree around 12:00 to 6:00 in the morning, you will see her on the tree with her baby in her arm singing to it and scaring anyone who trespasses her tree.

Children See The Darndest Things,"New York, United States",Children Who See Spirits,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Children Who See Spirits :: Children See The Darndest Things

I used to baby sit a lot when I was in high school. In our small town, which is consider a Hamlet, there is a huge house in the center of it. Some lady bought it, used it for a bed & breakfast for about 10 years and her family lived there. Her husband was sick and had passed away. A couple years after his death, she sold the house. Then, a military bought the house. I noticed the family outside one day and since it's such a small town, I thought I would go introduce myself to them. They had 3 small children. 3 beautiful little boys who I've become to love and care for very much.

At any rate, I told them that if they ever needed a babysitter I would be more than happy to baby sit for them. They didn't really know anyone in the town and for a while I didn't get a call for babysitting, but the wife who wasn't too off from my age wanted to hang out. So we hung out and while we became great friends, the children got to know me. Her and I were talking and we had a weird feeling. She told me that the house creeped her out and she thought it was haunted. It was an old house and who knows what could have happened in there?! Well, her oldest son, who was only 5 at the time, came into the living room where we were sitting and he said ""Mommy... Ashley... do you hear those screams? Mommy help that man"" Amanda was scared and she asked her son what man he was talking about and he said ""the man at the bottom of the stairs, mommy he's on fire, help him get some water."" We were freaked out and didn't know what to do. We went to the bottom of the stairs, and didn't see a man of course. We ignored it.

The very next day we were outside relaxing in the yard and her oldest came to us again and said ""Mommy I'm going to go inside and play with the good brothers."" We thought he was talking about his two younger brothers so she said ""ok."" He went inside. But we looked up and the other two boys were playing in the sand box. So I went in the house and saw Jet (the oldest) playing in the toy room and talking loud and laughing! I asked him who he was talking to, and he said ""The good brothers Ashley"" I ran out to Amanda and I told her that she needed to come in the house. We got freaked out so we started researching the house. We looked in the old barn and there was TONS of papers and information on the house. Apparently there was a fire in the hall (at the bottom of the stairs) and a man died in flames. We got scared so we went to the stairs and we pulled back the carpet that was on the floor and there was a burnt spot. I never had that many chills run through my body! Then the good brother thing seemed like it could have been just Jet's imagination.

We didn't think anything of it... but one day we went up to the loft at the top of the house. There are 3 floors on this house. After the attic, there is a little loft with windows where you can look out to the town. We went up there to look around, one night, and there was tons of writing on the walls... where people had signed the walls and wrote quotes and things. Even writings from way back in the 1890s. We were signing it ourselves and I looked up and above my head I saw ""long live the good brothers"" there was no way that Jet wrote that. He was only 5 and 3.5 feet tall! We got freaked out and ran downstairs.

Also, in that house there was a hallway that they didn't use because it had 2 extra bedrooms they didn't need. So they shut it off. Well in that hallway there is the washer and dryer. I was washing some blankets for her and I got really creeped out when I walked into the hall. There is one bedroom that is kind of dark and creepy. I went in it before and still felt weird. I usually RAN past it if I had to go to the laundry room. Well I found out about the woman who owned it before. Her husband died in that room. He died of tobacco caused lung-cancer.

And to add to that... 5 days after I found out that he had died in that room, Jet said he heard ""Uncle Charlie coughing upstairs and it was bothering him"" We asked who Uncle Charlie was and he said ""the man that sleeps in the room next to the washer"" We got freaked out because that woman's husband's name was Charles. Jet wouldn't know that. We were scared. Needless to say they live in Italy now. ha ha!

Now the superintendent of my old high school lives there. She doesn't have young kids and she says that she hasn't seen anything weird. Tell me what you think...

Port Macquarie Freak house,Australia,Apparitions / Voices / Touches,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Apparitions / Voices / Touches :: Port Macquarie Freak house

I was on a holiday near Port Macquarie Australia at a friends house, my friend was left the house (in a will) when his grandma recently died. I came in the house for the first time and I felt uneasy, I ignored it at first, but I couldn't stand it until something really paranormal happened. I had stayed at the house for a week now and started to see and hear things, unexplainable noises and shadows, it didn't really bother me, I just thought it was all in my head, until my friend left the house for the night. I was all alone, I felt sick so I ran to the bathroom but before I could reach it, I was staring at a tall dark figure standing in front of the doorway. I almost passed out until I realized the figure was gone. I heard knocking and I thought it was my friend at the door, but I turned around and saw a pail scruffy man that was head banging against the wall. At this point I fainted.

When I woke up, my friend was hanging over me, panicking, but I just ran straight out of the house. That was the worst experience I had ever had and to this day I still have nightmares.

Top Hat Boy,United Kingdom,Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: Top Hat Boy

I was once in my house on my own, my parents had gone out for the night, when I walked through the hallway into the living room and I saw this little boy standing over my dog, and my dog was looking up at him, he was sort of stroking my dog, and he was wearing a top hat. I doubled checked and he was gone, but my dog was still looking up.

Then a couple of days later, my brother was in the house, talking to his friend over the computer, he put his web-cam on, then got up to go to the loo, and when he came back his friend, who he was on web-cam, said ""who is that little boy?"" (thinking it was like my brother's little cousin or something) when actually, my brother was home alone. His friend said he had seen a small boy wearing black wander into the room, appear on web-cam, and then disappear.

My house is brand new, so I can't figure out why it would be haunted, but it is built where a mental hospital was used to be built. what is going on?

The Fake Wall in the Walk In Closet,"Minnesota, United States",Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: The Fake Wall in the Walk In Closet

I moved to a new house because my dad was laid off. We got an old 2 stories house and I had a basement room that was old and smelled of mildew. I was packing my things in and I kept hearing these knockings on the wall. I told my dad, but he said it was old pipes. One day, I told my brother mike to come down and listen to it. He listened and said it was pipes. I responded ""it isn't pipes you retard"" and he shoved me. I fell through the closet and knocked my metal model of a honda civic through the back. It was fake so me and mike took it off and walked in. It was a staircase, we then got flash lights and walked down and opened an old wood door. It was a room with old storage items in it. We walked over and then the door behind us closed. A huge blur of white came right at us screaming in a horrid tone. We were in pure terror, we ran up and told my dad. He came down and looked at it, walked down and right as he was opening the old wood door, the door knob started to rumble and shake. He ran up the stairs and the next day we moved out.

This is the first time I have ever spoken of this, we have all tried to forget it.

Water Heater Materialization,"Wisconsin, United States",Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: Water Heater Materialization

I haven't had too many experiences with the spiritual world, but A LOT of people who I know have. There are just a few random things I'd like to share just to see what others think.

I am convinced there is a spirit of some sort living in my Dad's house. He is not sure if there is one or not, but sometimes when he comes home at night, the pictures on top of his T.V. are moved around. He lives alone, so no one else is in the house to move them. Sometimes when I am over there, I will see a flash of light go by for no apparent reason. He sees it to. We don't know what it is though.

This is what scared me more than anything though; A while ago, he needed a new water heater. He had no idea where to get one, what they looked like, what size to get, or anything. He was completely clueless. He racked his brain to figure out what he should get and had no idea. One day, he went in the basement to practice on his guitar (my dad is a musician, and spends most of his time in the basement recording). When he went down there, right in front of him was a water heater. The exact one that he needed! Neither of us have any idea where it could have come from. Again, I say, he lives alone, so there is NO one there who could have done it. He is the ONLY one who has a key to his house.

Also... I am not sure if this is relevant in any way, but the house he lives in used to be a church.

My Dead Cats,"Ohio, United States",Pets / Animals,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Pets / Animals :: My Dead Cats

F or a couple of weeks, I've been feeling my old black cat's presence. She has been dead over four years now. I got two more cats. Last night at exactly 3:34 am, I woke up because the lights were on in my house. I got scared so I prayed to God to put an angel at my bedroom door. I looked out the bedroom door and saw a cat. I first thought it was my kitten. I called to him, but he disappeared into thin air. I looked again and there was my dad's old cat. He has been dead for maybe 2 years. I got really scared at that time. I ran down stairs to where my mom was sleeping. I told her everything. She believed me because once she saw a ghost.

I once was playing upstairs with my kitten and he started to go crazy. I thought maybe he saw our old cats ghosts. So I am not afraid right now. I am glad!

Country Horrors,Canada,Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: Country Horrors

I was fifteen when this occurred. It was in an old farm house in Burford Ontario. I went to visit my friend and his family for a week in the summer of 2001, they had recently bought a farm house that needed some work. The house had some disturbing history, the previous owner had hung himself in the basement of the house some six years ago. When I say basement, it's more like a cellar. It has no entry from the inside the house, only from the outside, right beside the main entry to the house. The house had also suffered a fire before this owner, which he never fixed. The house was split into two sections to get to the other section, aka what he called the burnt rooms, you had to go down a long hallway upstairs, which had three rooms in it. One was my friend's room, the other a bathroom and the third the burnt room. At the end of the hallway was a door which led to the second part of the house. I only went in the second part of the house once, but it was destroyed.

My friends parents where currently trying to fix it up, but there was still a lot of fire damage. As the week went on, they told me the stories of some of the past: two families had shared the house, when one night, the second portion caught fire and killed a husband, his wife and their son. Now in the burnt room in the hallway, when my friends parents cleaned it out, they tore out a wall and behind the the wall, they found a can of arsenic with a kitchen spoon in it. Well, when I stayed there I had the pleasure of hearing what I thought to be b-s stories, bangings, voices and odd feelings.

One night, we were in my friends room getting ready to go to bed, listening to music fairly loud, but we were so far away from everyone else it didn't matter. We heard a very loud and abrupt knock on the door. We turned down the music, opened the bedroom door, no one there, we figured it was my friends brother messing with us. Then it happened again, we looked, no one.  I decided to stand by the door and when his brother knocked, I would open the door right away. So, sure enough, they knocked I opened, no one there, so I looked in the hall way and the door to the burnt section was wide open. Me and my friend ran downstairs and everyone was in the living room and my friends dad told us to stop goofing off and running around, but we weren't.

We went back up to his room with his brother, played the music and the knock started again, this time, we just turned down the music and you could hear someone running and giggling  and slam the door at the end of the hallway to the burnt rooms.

And not be out done my friend, his brother and I all slept in that room the next night and heard someone in the burnt room shuffling around for about 20 minutes. The most terrifying experience of my life.

House of Horror,Canada,Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: House of Horror

W hen I was 14, we moved into a an old cpr house. Things were good for the first 2 nights, then it started. My brother's rocking chair would move by itself, at first, just for a few minutes, then it started to go all day. We were not allowed to enter the basement, but my brother and I went down anyway. As soon as we reached and touched the dirt, things changed, someone or something threw rocks and  broken furniture at us, screaming at us to get out.

After that, things got worse. We heard furniture move, pictures would fly off the wall. There was scratching on the windows, and when we looked, we'd see faces staring back at us. Whatever was in that house did not like me. It would slap me hard enough to leave marks. My brother and I got our pastor from our church to lend us crosses, and a prayer book, we thought we could beat this thing. When we approached the basement, once again, we made it about half way down, when the screaming started again, yelling for us to get out. As soon as I touched the dirt floor, a man came in front of me and pushed me backwards. My brother, feeling we were not welcome in that house, grabbed me an ran outside.

We left that home that night, after just 3 months. We got movers to get our stuff. When they delivered our belongings, the movers even said that they felt uncomfortable there, and that they think someone told them to get out.

"The Squatter, the Pacer, Bride & Groom and the Dark One","California, United States",Ghost Hunting,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Ghost Hunting :: The Squatter, the Pacer, Bride & Groom and the Dark One

T here is a full moon out this night.  I can only wonder what is in store for me this evening as I get together with H.P.I. (Haunted and Paranormal Investigations) of Northern California.  H.P.I. will be headed down to Brookdale Lodge in the Santa Cruz mountains sometime in the future to conduct an investigation.  Due to family obligations, this is one investigation I will not be able to attend.

Imagine this.  A family calls H.P.I., they have some pesky ghosts in their home and they want to know what they are dealing with.  H.P.I. shows up with black or dark blue windbreakers on, emblazoned with large letters H.P.I. on the back of the jackets, similar to what the DEA, FBI, ATF wear.  All members are wearing sunglasses and have RAP4 Secret Service Ear Piece with Secret Service Throat Mic, prepared for action.  HPI Investigators pull up in 3 black SUVs with HPI displayed on the driver side of the vehicle.  There I go again, daydreaming on how this investigation will turn out.  HPI unlike the DEA, FBI, ATF are not seeking criminals, but are seeking ghosts, poltergeists, shadow people, demons, etc.  Of course, since we are all paranormal investigators, we would not turn down the opportunity to investigate an alien abduction, Bigfoot or anything else classified as 'paranormal'.

This night we will have two new paranormal investigators on the team, their names are Amanda Hopper and Janice Cameron.  I met Janice through my neighbor Nick Asevedo.  Nick paid his membership dues to HPI, but has yet went on an investigation.  He has experienced the paranormal.  He relates an incident in which he lived in Reno/Sparks, Nevada and his family saw a ghostly little boy sitting on the edge of their bed, they learned he once lived there and drowned in the tub.  The little boy ghost threw a plant off the coffee table at the family and the family decided it was time to move.  Nick has gotten his family involved, his niece Tiffany Cameron and her mother Janice Cameron went to their first HPI meeting at the Coffee Garden and brought along Nick's girlfriend Jamie Warden.  Tiffany, Janice, Nick and Jamie are all paying members of HPI, but only Janice is the lucky one who pulled the lucky number from the passed around hat and was selected to go on this investigation!   The H.P.I. meetings are a lot of fun, because we get to analyze the audio and video footage of various investigations.  The meetings are a learning experience.

Now let's get back to reality, the investigation begins, well almost.  I bring along Janice Cameron who lives in my neighborhood and we stop off at Amanda Hopper's home to pick her up.  Amanda is quite the character and greeted me with a third eye attached to her forehead.  We head over to Starbucks on Broadway/15th Street.  This is a popular Starbucks because it's located in a part of downtown in which you can sit outside on a warm nice day and people watch.  You get some interesting characters on Broadway, there is always plenty to watch.  Too bad, we couldn't have met at the Starbucks in El Dorado Hills, because the Starbucks in El Dorado Hills has a restless spirit that is known to toss around coffee filters at the employees.  Janice as a token of thanks, bought me a nice hot grande caramel macchiato.

Shannon and the crew arrive and Shannon briefs us on the investigation.  Shannon goes through her spill of being professional at all times, respect the home, no drinking, no excessive loud talking, etc.  Roll Call for HPI Paranormal Investigators are:  Shannon McCabe/President; Paul Dale Roberts/Ghost Writer/Assistant Organizer; Carol Gillis/Secretary; Tim Hawkins; John Wachter aka Vlawde; Michele Paykel; Mary Casiano; Member who wishes to remain anonymous; Janice Cameron; Alicia Perry and Amanda Hopper.  I am introduced to the occupant of this house, that looks like a miniaturized Amityville Horror home, with the 2 large windows that look like eyes.  The occupant of the house identifies himself as Scott Bailey, a locally known artist.  In fact he works at the B Street Theater which is reputed to be haunted also.  Scott's artwork is all over the house, such as a Barbie Doll entrapped in wire mesh and gothic type of drawings.  Carol Gillis comes over to me and reports that she felt a sharp coldness on her back.

In my interview with Scott, he relates that he has a low grade intuition and constantly feels like someone is watching him from the closet.  There are possibly 5 entities in the home.  Scott has a name for each one, there is the Squatter.  The Squatter is in the closet and he squats and stares.  He believes the Squatter is a Hispanic man.  The Pacer, an active ghost that paces the hallway.  He believes this is the ghost that gets right up in his face and he feels a face right next to his face.  Bride & Groom, his sister detected the presence of a bride and groom in the home.  The Dark One is a spirit that seems to have a darkside to his character.  The Dark One is a weak spirit, but seems to be somewhat on the sinister side.  A friend of Scott once spent the night and dreamed about a family, a man, woman and a child naked in the field and being forced down a grain chute into a grinding machine and being scattered into the fields as fertilizer.  He believes this dream came to him by The Dark One.  Scott relates that the prior owner was combative in his persona and would stir up the spirits.  When Scott first moved in, there seemed to be a lot more activity.  There seems to be more ghost activity in the bedroom and hallway and at times the ghosts seemed bored and fall into stagnant energy where nothing occurs.  This is how Scott describes on how the ghosts of his home behave.

The home was built during the 1800s, the bathroom is a newer addition to the house and built in the 1940s.  The lower floor was once a deli and they would serve sandwiches to the dairy that used to be across the street in the 1940s through the 1950s.  While the investigators were setting up video cameras, using their EMF Readers, there was detection at the closet area, the same area the Squatter hangs out at.  The reading jumped from 1, jumped 2 more times to 1 and then there was no more readings for this area of the closet.  EMF Reader is an electro magnetic energy sensor.  I went into the back room and Michele felt like she was pushed in her chair.  There were some orbs captured on video.  Some cold spots detected.  Amanda, a sensitive was picking entities in various parts of the room, she would breathe deeply and sense the area around her and feel where an entity may be at.  Hmmm....what did I personally detect, you might ask?  At one time I felt a cold sensation on my back, then I turned around and I was next to a window.   I was looking through a video camera on a tripod and thought I saw some orbs, but they were only dust particles.  I had Mary shake her jacket and when the dust fell from her jacket, they appeared to be orbs on the camera.  Now the West Sac orbs moved erratically, especially when you have 3 flying in unison.  I didn't see that kind of orb activity at this haunting.   I'm not from Missouri, but I do enjoy the State's motto...""show me"".  I experienced more at the National Hotel in Jackson and the West Sac haunting, than what I experienced here.   Of course, we haven't received our results yet from the audio and video tapes.  Sci Fi Channel's Ghost Hunters weren't always successful and perhaps there are ghosts in this strange looking home, but I guess I wanted to see something that was extraordinary.  Enough of the feelings.  Two words...""show me!""   As I got home, I turned on the Cartoon Channel and guess what was on?  Yep, Scooby Doo and the gang doing some ghost busting.  I thought to myself, when will we have a haunting that is as frightening as the ones you see on the Discovery Channel's A Haunting?  What I like about Shannon is that she has a skeptical eye and she seeks the truth through science, in fact she was the one that told me to always make sure that orbs are not dust particles or reflection of light from another source.  Shannon is seeking not a Scooby Doo haunting, but the real thing and I must agree with Shannon on that!  If anything, this is a learning experience.   For more on H.P.I. go to: www.HPIparanormal.net

Dream of the Devil,"Pennsylvania, United States",Misc,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Misc :: Dream of the Devil

I would like to share a ""dream"" I had one night. I can't remember all of the details, it happened months ago, but it really creeped me out.. yet made me a stronger believer in religious faith. In my dream, I only remember that I was on the computer and about to turn it on. You know how you can see your reflection in the blank monitor? Instead of seeing my own reflection, I saw the face of the devil, like it was trying to take me over. I can't remember much more about the dream, except that the devil was stalking me and I could not escape it. It would not let up on me, and I was becoming very weak to it. Until I used the words ""in the name of Jesus Christ, leave me alone"" and that was it. What's really crazy is that I have never really heard this expression in real life, because I wasn't really brought up religiously and can count on both hands the number of times I've attended church. It was just very bizarre.

I'm convinced this was an encounter with the devil. I'm not sure what for, though. On the other hand, I think it was an angel or a servant of God or SOMETHING GOOD that came to save me and told me these words to use. I told my mother some of my dream, who was brought up as a roman catholic and is still pretty religious, and she said she has had similar experiences and all I had to do is say ""in the name of Jesus Christ, go away"". She told me to say this before I even finished the whole story, and before I even told her that I did finally say something to that effect. I was just wondering if anyone else had any experience like this, or if anyone could interpret what mine means?

I would like to note that I am only 18 years of age, I do not do drugs, and I do not drink. I was of completely sound mind when this occurred! Also, about the devil attacking those who are weak, I have always been physically weak, I naturally only weigh 100 pounds and am 5'6"" tall.. and I am also emotionally weak, I am a very emotional person and although I'm not diagnosed I think I have depression. I am also a very shy person and have been my whole life.. just thought I would share in case it helps in interpreting my ""dream"".

Young Children,"Tennessee, United States",Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: Young Children

I t was a while back, when I was about 12 or 13 (I am 14 now), and I was in my kitchen eating a blueberry muffin when I saw a young boy with blonde hair, no older than 9 or 10, wearing a blue shirt, ran up my stairs. I thought it was my brother or his friend (he had a sleep over that night) so I went into his room and he and his friends were still sleeping and none of them had a blue shirt on.

About a week or so later, I had a friend sleeping over and we both started to smell blueberries when I realized I was eating a blueberry muffin when I first saw the boy. Then I was again in my kitchen and I saw a glow of some sort in the mirror by the front door. So as I walked toward there I could've sworn I saw a young woman's face. She was very pretty with blonde hair. I ran over there and there was nothing there but the coat hangers were moving as if something was.

Again, about 2 years ago, my mother came home from work one morning and she was eating breakfast. The garage door began to open and close repeatedly. Another time, my dog actually sensed it. It was around 10:00 p.m. and my mom was the only one awake and my dad was out of town. My mom was getting ready for bed when Maisey started barking. She was looking into the darkness and my mom tried to calm her down. Then she began to get low to the ground and squinted her eyes like someone was hitting her or petting her. She ran out into the hallway and woke me up. My mom was still in her room trying to get Maisey back in there but she just started crying.

I forgot about everything until last night (March 3rd) when I saw a little girl sitting on my bed. I asked her all sorts of questions. She did not speak. She was very young about 6 years old and had short blonde hair and bangs. I asked her her name and she wrote it down. I do not remember exactly what it was because it was French. I noticed it was another language and I am currently taking German and it looked like German, but when I asked her she said it was French. I believe her name started with a B but I am not certain. She began to walk around and play with my stuffed animals. I was afraid to ask her how she died, for she seemed so happy and I didn't want to ruin her spirits. Then the next thing I knew, she was just gone.

So this morning I was asking my brother, mom, and dad if they knew any thing about a young French girl that died and they all have no clue what I'm talking about. My question for all of you is, how is it possible to have so many ghosts in my house when it is brand new and nobody has died here. I also want to know if it would be safe to use a Ouija board to find out more about them.

Electrical Appliances Turning On and Off,"California, United States",Misc,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Misc :: Electrical Appliances Turning On and Off

T his happened about an hour ago and has been recurring for the last hour. Meaning it's still going on. But it has been stopped for about 10 minutes. I was on my computer doing some research for my homework and I had my phone off because my friend kept calling me. I seriously turned it off, I mean I really really turned it off. I had it off and my music on and my room lights on and my computer on and well you get it.

I was researching and my phone started ringing, I answered it and my friend called and I talked to her for like a minute or so, after I hung up I remembered I had it turned off. I looked at it, and it was off. I called my friend on my house phone and asked her if she had just called and she said yes, and she had called my cell phone. I was really creeped out, but I just said okay and hung up. A few minutes later, my music stopped playing and I checked my iTunes if something was wrong, nothing was. So I checked my speakers, nothing. The volume dial, nothing. I was kind of confused at this. Just as I had my ear right next to the speakers to hear any static, the music started playing and I screamed. Not because I was scared, it was because it hurt my ear.

I calmed down and was almost finished with my essay when my computer turned off and turned back on. All in under a few seconds. Yes I was upset at my dumb computer. But I was more confused. Confused about my phone, speakers and computer. I went to ask my dad if anything in the house was acting weird, he said no. Even if they were acting weird, it wouldn't explain anything. So I went back to my room to finish my essay .. again. But when I stepped into my room, I felt as if something was different. When I looked around, my phone was on. My iPod was on. My camera was even on. It was weird and when I looked around, nothing else was on. My computer was off, my speakers were off, and my lights were off. I was really creeped out. My speakers were off, like when they were on, the switch was on ""on"", but then it was turned to ""off"". I turned all my stuff on. My phone, camera, and iPod, off. And now here I am telling you about what just happened.

Any ideas about what just happened to me? Oh! And just so you all know, my brother is out of the house and my mom is out shopping and my dad is upstairs. So nobody was in my room except for me. Please tell me what you think!

Orb,British Indian Ocean Territory,Photographs / Videos / EVP,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Photographs / Videos / EVP :: Orb

I said that I would post another story as I get the chance, well how about a photo of an orb taken yesterday in my room. I was taking some photos in my room for my wife when I noticed an orb over my left shoulder in a self photo I had just taken. I then snapped another photo within a few seconds of the first and the orb was not only still there, it was more defined and brighter than the first.

There are some other smaller lighter orbs in the background that I believe to be dust or something different than the largest one. I have taken the photos onto my photoshop and have blown them up and also done a negative exposure to them and the largest orb is still in both. They say seeing is believing so I will send them along with this story and hopefully they will be posted together. I will include both photos for comparison. They say that orbs can be anything from dust to bugs, but never have I had an orb go from transparent to almost solid in a matter of seconds.

I have a ghost hunt planned for here on island and I will let you all know what happens with that one.

My Son Has a Ghost Friend,"California, United States",Children Who See Spirits,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Children Who See Spirits :: My Son Has a Ghost Friend

M y son, who just turned 4 last month, has told me in the past about having a ghost friend. I have asked many questions about his friend but my son never really tells me anything that's consistent so I brush it off.

Yesterday, he was in his bed room watching a movie and I went into his room to check on him and he was leaning over his turtle's tank and the room smelt very strongly of perfume. I asked him what he was doing and he told me that he had poured a bottle of perfume into his turtle's tank. I immediately get furious as he knows full well that the turtle tank is off limits as he has been in trouble for touching the tank before. He started saying ""I'm sorry, I'm sorry"" and I asked him why we did that, as he could have killed our turtle, he told me that his ghost friend made him, that he didn't want to and that his ghost friend makes him follow his bad rules. I told him that his ghost friend is not welcome in our house and he needs to go to the other side. My son was upset and said that he would miss his friend and he's a good friend.

I need some advice as I'm not sure how to deal with this and how to help my son part with his ""friend"". Please feel free to leave a message or email me at susan_adkins [at] hotmail [dot] com. I would appreciate it.

Ghost in the Tub,"Virginia, United States",Misc,"I think there is a ghost following my family. Ever since I was about seven or eight years old, I would get a weird feeling whenever I would walk into my bathroom. And this was in any place that my family and I live in or visited. Whenever I would enter the bathroom and the lights were off, I would hear the shower curtains ruffle, or I would see them sway. If by chance I walked by the bathroom and the curtains were open, I always saw what appeared to be a figure of a small female child playing in the bathtub. Now no one else has ever noticed this but me. When I turned 10 it stopped happening for about two years. Then it started happening again, this time I noticed that the lights would occasionally flicker, even when I would be in the shower or tub, the lights would flicker with no one else in the room. I am now twenty-two and haven't experienced this in a while, but to this day it freaks me out.

Has anyone else ever heard of this happening, or has anyone had this happen. If so please let me know what you think.

Early Hauntings,"Alaska, United States",Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: Early Hauntings

M y mother and I were talking last night and I happened to mention something odd that had occurred in my room recently. Well, one thing led to another and we found ourselves discussing some of the experiences the entire family had had when we lived in a decrepit trailer in Valdez, AK (we moved away when I was seven and have been living in the capital for almost eight years now). And I thought that I would just share some of these with you all. I have the consent of my family members to speak of this, but I will not use their names if I use them at all.

One encounter was when I was around four years old. I remember this vividly because of how annoying it was and how much trouble it got me in. This one happened only to me. I had a bunk bed when I was little and always slept on the top because the shadows on the floor at night always scared me. Now, I was always afraid of falling off the top bunk even though there was a rail and ladder, so I slept as close to the wall as possible. One night, I heard that familiar whispering , like somebody calling my name. I ignored it and tried to go back to sleep. I started to hear the voice right up against my ear and I could feel breath against my skin. When I still didn't respond, I guess whatever it was got mad because I felt strong hands lift me up and the next thing I knew I was falling to the floor and I landed on all of my toys and books. My room had been trashed! Like any child, I started to cry and my mom came into the room and simply said I'd fallen and scolded me for making such a mess.

The next day, my mom said that she wouldn't take me to my grandma's until I'd cleaned up my room. So, I put everything away (it took me over an hour) and thought I heard my mom call my name. I got up and went to the other end of the trailer to ask her what, she didn't call me of course, but asked to see my room. We went to my room to find it even more trashed than it had been before. I stood there in shock after my mom left me to clean again, and thought I heard taunting laughter behind me. I remember saying, ""That's not funny, stop it right now!"" I cleaned again, and the room stayed clean.

Fast forward a year or so, my mom is standing in the kitchen on the phone with my grandma staring at this big yellow door that led to a storage area we never went in. The door had a small window on it and, as my mom stared at it, it started to open all on its own! My mom dropped the phone and ran down the street to my grandma's. She was the only one in the trailer at that time (about mid afternoon).

My dad, (let's call him Jim) had a horrible dream where he had an out-of-body experience. He was floating above his body and could see him and my mom laying there sleeping. They had a closet at the foot of their bed that had mirrors on the outside, and Jim found himself being tugged towards the mirror. Ghost-like hands reached out and grabbed his legs, pulling him into the mirror and into another world, away from his body. Jim tried to get free and back to his body. He suddenly found himself back in his own body and the entire bed was covered in a cold sweat, he woke my mom and ever since that day until we moved, he slept out on the couch. I was about six at the time.

This last one happened in front of both me and my mom. It was the month after I'd turned seven and my brother was about four the time. We had come back from the store and it was about four in the afternoon I guess, and when we opened the door, we both saw a large goblet my mom kept on top of the TV lift itself into the air, hover for a moment, then shoot straight across the room away from us to crash into the wall. Neither me nor my mom said anything, we simply shut the door again and went to my grandma's.

Baby in the House,American Samoa,Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: Baby in the House

T his happened to me on friday, march 2, 2007. I was sleeping in my room with my door opened, as well as the hallway door, which wasn't very long. I woke up and saw my little 1 year old sister, natalie, standing near the sofa. I got up to get her. I was close to the door of the living room when I heard my mom's voice ""Alyssa, what's the matter?"" she said. Still looking at what appeared to be my sister I replied ""oh, I think I seen nat-nat standing near the sofa"", ""Oh, she was walking around but she laid back down."" She replied. I looked in her room and sure enough, natalie was sleeping. But then I turned back to the sofa and still I saw ""natalie"".

I went back to my bed and went to sleep. Then, the next night, my 10 year old cousin louie spent the night. In the morning, he said he saw my sister by the sofa where I had seen her night before and heard my mom on the phone. My mom's answer: "" I was asleep all night and the door was closed leaving natalie unable to get if she indeed woke up.""

Here is another story that happened in the same house. Now, I only have taken 1 bath, and 1 bath only I that very house. Reason being? The night that I took a bath, I started seeing very long gray hairs. At first, I didn't think twice about it until more and more started coming out. Then, as I was about to get out, the plug shout out into the air, hitting the ceiling. To this day, I have never taken a bath, only showers.

Thank goodness we are now moving! Hit me up with some comments please on my stories. Thanks!

The Autistic Child Who See Spirits,"Wisconsin, United States",Children Who See Spirits,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Children Who See Spirits :: The Autistic Child Who See Spirits

M y Dad has a friend, and I think his friends daughter sees spirits.  Here are a few things that have happened to her. She is seven years old and autistic. She is also going deaf, she can hear somewhat okay right now, but as time goes on, doctors say she will go completely deaf.

If you have read my water heater story , you will know that I think there is a spirit living in my Dad's house. Once I was at his house with her and her mom. Her mom, my dad, and I were talking while she was playing with her dolls. Later on, she got up and stood in front of the door to the computer room. She signs rather than talking usually, because she is used to doing that at school. Eventually, we noticed that she was signing ""pay attention"" to the empty room. I am not fluent in sign language, but her mom was saying that she was talking to what seemed like 2 or 3 people, and was telling each one of them to ""pay attention"" and was getting mad when they wouldn't. We asked her, ""who are you talking to?"" and she just looked at us. Then, we said, ""What are their names?"" and she said, ""I don't know.""

She was staying at a baby-sitter's house and everything was fine until all of a sudden she freaked out and started crying. The baby-sitter called her mom and said that it would probably be best if she picked her up and took her home. When her mom took her home, she asked what was wrong, but she wouldn't tell her. She didn't talk at all for about a week. When she finally started talking, she told her mom that when she was at the baby-sitter's house, she saw a man and his son standing by the staircase and they were scaring her.

I have one other thing to tell that happened to this girl's sister;

When she was 3 years old, she wouldn't sleep in her own room. Her mom finally got her to go in there, and was tucking her in. Her mom noticed that she was staring off into space. She asked, ""What are you staring at?"" and the 3 year old responded ""The lady standing behind you."" Later on, the mother found out that the lady who owned the house before them died there. I have never been to her house, but there are a lot of people who know her that won't go back after being there a few times.

Something Attacks Me Before Falling Asleep,South Africa,Old Hags / Night Attacks / Sleep Paralysis,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Old Hags / Night Attacks / Sleep Paralysis :: Something Attacks Me Before Falling Asleep

L ast night, it happened again. Goshhh, it is scary! I was sleeping over at my boyfriend's place. We fell asleep at about 24:00 pm. At about 1:30 am it happened. Something woke me up and I was lying in bed frustrated because of waking up. As I started dozing off to wonderland, I heard a hollow, loud kind of noise in my ears. I was forced down to my bed, couldn't move, couldn't even make a noise. Then after about 30 seconds, it went away. I was horrified, then I tried to fall asleep again, but it happened all over again, this time it was real bad. Lying in bed trying to fight off whatever it was attacking me, knowing I'm awake, but it feels like I'm in some deep sleep, coma kind of thing, I saw how demons/spirits were dragging me around the bed, pulling me away from my boyfriend, I couldn't breath, my heart was beating so fast, goosebumps all over my body. In my mind, trying to fight it off, and praying to God to please take it all away. Then I was able to make a slight noise, and it woke my boyfriend up. We sat up all night, he told me he was having bad dreams at the same time. The room we slept in just felt so scary & dark, it wasn't a feeling of a ghost, it felt more like devils or demons or I don't know. It felt like something or someone was hiding away.

I'm terrified of falling sleep tonight, so scared it happens again. The funny thing is when I pray to God, after praying, it mainly happens. It's like something wants to prevent me from having any contact with God. This is not fun people. If anyone has advices, please I would appreciate it.

The Ghost in the Living Room,"Colorado, United States",Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: The Ghost in the Living Room

M e and my dad swear this house is haunted. Of course, my mom won't have any idea of it. My dad was asleep and he heard high heels walking across the room. I know it's true because I've heard them too. My dad thought it was my mom trying to scare him. He waited until it got really close to him. He felt cold! He turned around and was going to scare my mom, he yelled raaaawwwww and there was nobody there! And a few nights later, we heard it again. He waited until it got really close and he held real still, he felt cold again! Then the cover was pulled up around closer to his neck. He waited until the foot steps were a little farther away, he turned around and there was no body there!

We see the curtains in the hall move all the time and stuff fall during the middle of the night. What ever it is, I don't think it's trying to hurt us. It must have been a mom because it covers us up at night if were uncovered.

If anybody has experienced stuff like this, please comment. I want to know!

Floating Eyes,"Maine, United States",Orbs / Lights / Mists,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Orbs / Lights / Mists :: Floating Eyes

W hen he was young, my grandpa he was a wild man, he drank all the time and cussed. Him and his cousin Wade were going coon hunting on a old road that they lived on. It was out in the middle of the woods. As you know, it's dark when you go coon hunting. Well, my grandpa and Wade were driving my grandpa's car. It was a piece of junk! It quit and they were in the middle of the woods, trying to work on the car. The only light they had was a lighter, it was almost out of fluid. My papaw was mad and cussing and Wade told him there was something coming up here. My papaw told him to shut up and to hold the lighter still. But Wad dropped the lighter and jumped in the car. My papaw turned around and saw two yellow eyes floating toward the car. He yelled and jumped in the car with Wade. The eyes circled the car over and over. This is true, my papaw was a Christian and wouldn't lie.

Please comment if you have experienced anything like this, I would love to hear your story.

The Falling Lunchbox,"Wisconsin, United States",Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: The Falling Lunchbox

W here do I begin? This is the first in a series of occurrence that have happened to me and my family. We had moved into a new house in Chippewa falls Wisconsin. The place seemed nice enough, and we hadn't heard anything bad about it or its past.

One night, my family (mom, dad and me) were woken up by my school lunch box, the heavy plastic flip top lidded ones, violently falling down the staircase of our house. We thought one of our two cats had knocked it down the staircase, except for the fact that they were both in my parents bedroom sleeping with the bedroom door securely shut. My bedroom being upstairs was two rooms away from the staircase and there was no possibility of my lunchbox crashing down on it. Plus I remember specifically taking my lunchbox and setting it next to my bed after school that day. And to top everything off... my bedroom door was shut too.

After 6 years we still have never figured out how that lunchbox could have taken a tumble in the middle of the night, but after a few more instances in the house (which I will soon post), we truly believed that there was more than just us living in that house.

The Whispering Girl,"Montana, United States",Apparitions / Voices / Touches,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Apparitions / Voices / Touches :: The Whispering Girl

I t was a cold and chilly night when I was walking home from a party along a deserted road. There's this old church called the old Pink Church. There, people say that if you walk by it something will follow you. Well, I didn't exactly believe that story so I walked by. When all of a sudden, I felt someone staring at the back of my head and heard little foot steps walking along with mine. I was too scared to turn back and look who was there, but my gut told me to, so I did and saw no one. After walking a while, I heard a little humming coming from behind me. I didn't pay much attention to it and kept walking, but this time, a little faster. When all of a sudden, I heard the noise again. I picked up my pace a little more, faster when someone tapped me on the shoulder. I was scared and petrified that I ran all the way home. When I got home, I locked the doors and all the windows. I called for my mom to see if she was home and nobody answered. Just then I heard a loud pounding on the door. I then called out in a weak voice ""Who is it?"". Nobody answered, so I stayed where I was and after a while, ran up to my room and dashed into my covers.

After maybe about 10-15 minutes, I heard little foot steps walking around down stairs. I thought it was my mom so I got up and went to my door, but before I opened my door, I remembered that the front door never opened in the first place. Before I could get a chance to get back to my bed, the footsteps were outside my door and the door handle was turning. I could not move and all of a sudden, the door opened and there stood my pale looking mother in clothes that were either really bleached or just made that way. She said she has been calling my name but I didn't hear it. She told me to come with her and I said I wanted to get to bed early and she said all right.

When I felt that something fishy was going on, because my mother never wore white, I crept down the stairs to where I thought I heard her. But I found no one in the house with me or no trace of anyone being there. Later on that night, I told my mother and she said she has not been home since she left that morning. From then on I believed the story of being followed when you walk past the church.

Look Alike Figure,"West Virginia, United States",Apparitions / Voices / Touches,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Apparitions / Voices / Touches :: Look Alike Figure

H i I'm courtney, I just want to tell you all about a couple of my stories I have encountered. One was when I was asleep in my living room chair. My little sister is about 13 now and she had a friend stay the night with her. They were outside getting ready to come in and something made them stop and look up in the woods. When they stopped, they saw this girl that looked exactly like me. The girl, I guess, said that she wanted my sister and her friend to go up in the woods because the girl wanted to show them something and my sister's friend said ""NO! we are not going up there because that does not sound like courtney"".

The girl got mad and started talking in a deep voice to the girls. Kelsey ran in the house while Ellie followed her, and they came and woke me up and asked me why I was up in the woods and I told them ""I wasn't, I was here the whole time, and what are you talking about?"". They said that there was a figure exactly like me wanting them to go up in the woods, for some odd reason, and we all walked outside and it was gone. To tell you the truth it was not ME!

So I still have no idea what that figure was. And why it looked like me. If you have any ideas just tell me. Thanks for reading. I have a lot more but I will write them later on.

The Backyard Aura,"Wisconsin, United States",Apparitions / Voices / Touches,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Apparitions / Voices / Touches :: The Backyard Aura

T his is another story about the house my folks and I lived in, in Chippewa falls. It deals with the same staircase that the lunchbox fell down (see "" the falling lunchbox "").

One night after watching some t.v. with my parents, I decided to go to bed early because I was really tired. I said goodnight to them and started on my way to my upstairs bedroom. As I climbed up the staircase, I suddenly felt as if someone was watching from somewhere. I stopped and looked around and saw nobody. So I shrugged the feeling off and kept going up and as I passed by the window adjacent to the staircase, I noticed some sort of glowing in our backyard. I thought it was headlights of someone coming to visit us. So I looked closer and saw that it was a human sized glowing aura of sorts... just standing still as can be.

I rubbed my eyes thinking that maybe I was seeing things and then looked back and it was still there. I just stared at it for about a minute and I could feel whatever it was staring right back at me. I decided to open the window and say something to it and just as I was about to pull the window up... it disappeared in thin air, as if it knew I was going to say something to it.

I can only assume it was the spirit of the lady who lived there, previous to our moving in. I will explain about her in the next story I post. What do you all make of my incident??

Side note: the figure was almost like a foggy, shapeless outline of a body. I could not make out any details of a face or anything of that nature. Again, with that said.... what do ya'll think about this. Hit me back with your opinions.

Tickled Feet,Kenya,Apparitions / Voices / Touches,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Apparitions / Voices / Touches :: Tickled Feet

W hen my mum was in Kenya and my dad was still alive, one day he had to go on this work project. That night, my mum had this horrid nightmare, she said ""I dreamt I was in a land rover and it was night time, there was me and about three other people and the driver. Suddenly there was a massive thump and the driver turned around to us and said oh my god we've just hit something"", as the dream went on, she found out that it was a boy who was running along the round and ran side ways into the car.

My mum was so upset and the dream was so vivid that she told my dad about it when he got back. He apparently took a step back and with a horrified face said ""oh my god how did you know that?"". The weird thing was when he had been in a village (somewhere in kenya) a man's son had ran off while he was working at night time and had run into a big vehicle. He was killed instantly, my dad thought my mum was a witch for a long time after that.

Another day, my mum was sleeping in a hotel. That night, she felt her feet being tickled, she thought it was me and my sisters so she looked down to her feet smiling. She could see long white arms reaching down from the windows and touching her feet and when she kicked at them, they were snickering at her. She woke up relieved it was a dream. However, when she woke up, she found out that rumor had it that this place was haunted and she wasn't the first. When she left, she saw the builders were placing glass in the window holes, she thought it pretty strange (as ghosts cant pass glass).

These are only some of the weird stuff and the unexplained that has happened to me, my mum and my sisters.

Nightmare or Ghost?,"California, United States",Old Hags / Night Attacks / Sleep Paralysis,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Old Hags / Night Attacks / Sleep Paralysis :: Nightmare or Ghost?

I t's crazy to hear how many people have had this scary feeling happen to them while sleeping. I just had my second occurrence happen last night. I couldn't sleep and finally around 4:30 a.m., I started drowsing off when I felt something sit on the edge of my bed. I opened my eyes to see what it was and I realized I couldn't move and I got really scared and although I didn't see anything, I heard a man's voice tell me in my ear to ""not fight"". I was so scared and I was trying to hit him, but I could only move one hand. The more I tried to hit him, the heavier the pressure got on me. Then I finally got my other hand to move and I was trying to hit whatever was on top of me and then like nothing... it went away. I was so scared I couldn't stop crying or thinking about it. I've taken a psychology course where my professor explained that there is a term for this experience. It's called sleep paralysis... where your mind wakes up but your body hasn't fully and you experience these reactions. My mother has told me since I was little to never sleep with your arms across your chest because you would have nightmares. I swear it's true! It makes sense too.. I would think that the pressure and weight of your arms across your chest makes it harder for you to breathe while your sleeping and that in turn causes your mind to wake your body up the best way it knows how to... ""nightmares"".

I hope whoever reads this does not have to experience such a horrific feeling. God Bless!

Big Eyes,"Pennsylvania, United States",Apparitions / Voices / Touches,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Apparitions / Voices / Touches :: Big Eyes

W hen I was trying to find my big brother, I looked around the house outside and I saw a door shut. I went in the house and went through the bathroom door. I left it open a creak and I looked to the corner of my eye and I saw two big eyes so I turned around and said my brother's name and said ""Gotchya!"". The door slammed closed, but there was no windows open so I opened the door and nothing was there!

And that is my story and for the rest of my life I have been scared of ghosts. I talked to my friends and they believe me but my parents don't, my mom said ""It was a dream."" I didn't tell my dad yet. The weird thing is, when we came here, they had to build this house it was never built before my mom had my big brother. There is more weird things going on in this house, more paranormal things, so I will try to send them later on, but now have a good frightening time reading my ghost story.

I have been interested in ghost ever since I saw those two big white eyes, and I shall figure out what and why those unexplained eyes came to my house.

A Girl Standing Behind the Old Office,Malaysia,Apparitions / Voices / Touches,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Apparitions / Voices / Touches :: A Girl Standing Behind the Old Office

A t first I would like you to forgive me for my english, I'm actually from Malaysia. A few years back, around 1989 (I was 12 years old, now 30) I was living in my dad's house (office, later was converted to a house). The house was owned by his boss. This incident happened on saturday evening about 2:00pm. My house doesn't have water supply. Thus, we need to get the water from the factory nearby. It's about 800m from the factory to my house. It's always a headache for us to pick the water from bucket and have to walk about 800m every time we need the water. My parent decided to used a plastic hose. We fixed the hose to the factory water tap and to my house to get the water. This is how we used to have water supply. On the particular day, first my mom went alone to the factory. She returned home and expected to get the water from the hose. It's was not coming and my mom thought there was some leaking in somewhere. She insisted that me and my sister go and investigate why we didn't get the water supply, even when she turned on the pipe tap.

We were lazy. We used our bicycles instead to go to the place (the place was always scary and behind my house is a muslim cemetery). While we were riding, we saw a woman dressed in indian costume standing near the big tree and there is a wide drain in between the factory and the tree. We are the only indian living there and no way any human being can enter that place as it was a very bushy area.

She looked very beautiful and standing at the corner of the office (just beside the factory). We were stunned. We slammed out our bicycle and ran all the way to home. We told our mom what happened. She was speechless and she also had gone through similar experiences when she entered to the factory. She heard someone calling ma.. ma.. maaa... (mom) in a male voice.

This is very very true story. I swear upon God that I saw that a young woman standing there. I never believed in ghost, from this incident onwards I started believed in ghost and the strange happenings.

My other encounter was when I saw an very old and unusual tall man walking about 500 meters in front of me. I was on the way back from the temple. The time was about 2:00am, we had special prayers on the day and the temple is just walking distance.

Another one happened in the house I'm living now. Also considered as haunted, I always heard some noises in the middle of night. My dog keeping barking unconditionally at night and and I saw white smoke around my kitchen.

Yesterday, I was in the bathroom taking a shower. Suddenly, my bathroom door was pulled by someone (it's nearly open). I was stunned. I grabbed my clothes and I screamed at my niece for pranking me. But she was in my living room playing with her little doll. No one at home. Only me and she.

Ghosts exist. We can feel their existence. But they are not so strong as OUR BELOVED GOD. Trust him. Be brave when you happens to encounter such incident. Again forgave me for my english. Have nice day!

Little Boy Running,"Colorado, United States",Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: Little Boy Running

I had just moved into my new house. It has a swimming pool and my brother and I were swimming. I looked away and saw a little boy run by. I only have nieces. I didn't tell anyone. Then about two weeks later, two of my friends came over. One of them is very sensitive to spirits and such, both of them said they saw a little boy run by! Then we went in this little shack in my back yard and were looking around. There is a microwave in with no power going to it. It started making noise and then we herd a scream that sounded like a little boy. I have tried talking to him and he won't respond. He seems sad whenever he is near me. I just want to help!

There was this other time when I was at my sister's house and I woke up early to do my home work. When I was done, I had time to sleep. When it was time to wake up I couldn't. There was a dark thing over me. I felt it go in me. I thought it was taking over me for a minute. Time stood still and I went somewhere else but I don't know were. And after that, almost every morning I could feel it. I never saw it after that!

Ghosts Are Real,"Louisiana, United States",Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: Ghosts Are Real

I t was a warm summer night in mid July, and my cousin and I lay snuggled in bed together. The crickets were chanting outside; I could see the lightning bugs flashing through the air as I lay quietly gazing out of the window into the darkness. Suddenly, as I was absorbing the tranquility, I heard footsteps walking in the loft. These steps were creepy, and they sounded mysterious, while I silently observed each step. Gradually, the walking stopped and I fell asleep.

The next morning as my cousin and I played with our dolls, I told her about the footsteps in the loft and she told me that she had heard it before, but that she always tried to fall asleep before it manifested itself. So, we determined that night that we would stay awake and we would both peep to see who or what it was that walked in the loft during the late hours of the night. A few hours before daybreak, that night became a night that we would remember for many years to come.

As we giggled gently under the sheet, we watched and waited for the footsteps to appear. Finally, around 2 o'clock the creepy feet started strolling slowly through the loft. I pinched her and she pinched back as we lay lifeless listening to the steps as they moved closer toward us, then stopped above our heads. I stared through the covers, but did not see anything. My cousin saw a figure of an aged man standing near the window, she told me when we rose early the next morning.

Whether some people believe it or not, ghost have been known to exist and spirits may even be all around us. Many people don't believe in ghosts because they have never had an encounter with one, but there are lot of others who have witnessed these episodes and we know that they really do or have at some point existed.

The Mysterious Shadows,"Texas, United States",Apparitions / Voices / Touches,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Apparitions / Voices / Touches :: The Mysterious Shadows

I t was a hot June at my grandparents house and very boring. I desperately needed something to do. It is such a joy staying with old people. The town she lives in isn't that big. It is called Kermit. I really didn't think anything cool was going to happen that summer. I gave up all hope of fun or excitement. It was late at night and I decided to sleep in the last room in the back of the house with my little sister. She woke up saying she heard noises but I didn't pay attention to her and went back to bed. Who ever listens to their younger siblings. I woke up a little later and saw a figure of a person standing by the bedroom door, it just kept on looking at me and was probably standing there all night. I even kept covering my head thinking it would go away. A childish act, I know. At least is helped a little bit. Then my little sister woke up and said who is standing by the bed. The shadow just moved from the door to the bed.

Then it was morning and I told my grandma what happened but she wouldn't listen. I felt so ignored. So when night came, my sister and I decided to sleep in the living room with my brother. At least if the ghosts attack us we have an older brother to back us up.... Or sacrifice himself, whatever comes first. We went to sleep and kept on hearing heavy foot steps and all of a sudden, I saw glowing green eyes. It was impossible for it to come from a car, besides my grandma's block is very dark. This time my brother saw something creepy. He saw someone peeking through window and immediately shouted ""there is a ghost looking in on us!"" He jumped up turned on the light and nothing was there. I sighed, half of me sort of wanted to push him towards the ghost, then scream my head off while running away, but then again my mom would have killed me. We would never really know the secrets to those shadows but to this day, I won't go back to my grandma's. My parents force me to go though, but have they seen the things I've seen?

White Christmas Spirit,"West Virginia, United States",Apparitions / Voices / Touches,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Apparitions / Voices / Touches :: White Christmas Spirit

H i, this is another one of my other story. I was in my room being bored so I decided to read. I was laying on my bed and the house I live in now is new, nobody else has lived in it. I was laying there, reading with my legs up and my book resting on them. I had this feeling that something just told me to look in my door way. Well I did and I saw this white figure just standing there, looking at me and I was so scared, I closed my eyes for a couple of minutes. I decided to open them and it was still there, like a couple of seconds. When I opened my eyes, the figure just walked to the right of him/her into either the bathroom or my little sister's room but I never saw it again. That day was around christmas time and my aunt said the same thing happened to her and she just thought it was a christmas angel visiting. My mom said the same thing so it was probably it. I have experienced a lot more stories but I'm going to tell them all one at a time so you don't get confused.

The Little Boy in my House,"New Jersey, United States",Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: The Little Boy in my House

T o tell this story, I have to begin by saying ghosts are very real. In my home, there is the spirit of a little boy. At night, you can hear him walking around the house, making noises, playing with my little sister's toys. When trying to sleep, he would shake my bed. This has happened many times before. I have a night light in my room for when my nephew sleeps over. One night, the night lights up the whole room, while I just laid in bed, for a quick second the room went pitch black, I thought it might have just been my eyes adjusting to the dark. But then all of a sudden, with such slow creepiness, very very slowly the room went black... as if someone was covering the light. I was the only one in the room. I ran out the room. I have pictures of this ghost. My sister and mother have seen this little boy. He's a very white pale ghost color. I've spoken with him on a ouija board in my home. He's 12 years old. He died in the early 80's. Between things moving around a whistling at night to my bed shaking... there are ghosts.

Strange And Unexplainable Occurences In My Home,"New York, United States",Poltergeists / Physical Manifestations,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Poltergeists / Physical Manifestations :: Strange And Unexplainable Occurences In My Home

H i, this is the first time I've ever asked for advice or comments on what I have experienced. Until now, I have just prayed and tried to move on with my life thinking that these incidents have some sort of rational explanation. I never sought other people's comments since I thought that I was the only person this ever really happened to. After reading the stories on this site, I realize, now, that I am not alone.

A couple of things have happened to me that seemed rather strange - all of which have happened in the past couple of years. About six years ago, I was lying on my bed, sleeping, when I awoke and sat up straight. It was between 2:00am and 2:30am. I didn't even feel sleepy - I was wide awake. I used to sleep in the attic. The strange thing is that of all the places for my eyes to fall on, it was a candle holder on top of my TV that it did. It seemed as though my eyes were drawn to it for some reason. It was a bowl-like shape with cut out shapes on the sides so that when a candle is placed inside, the light comes out in the shaped patterns. It was silver in color. There was a window just behind me and my curtains were light and translucent so some light came through from the street light. After looking at this seemingly normal candle holder for about 15 seconds, I was amazed. I'm not sure if I was amazed because of the fact that it was spinning on its own or of the beautiful light show it provided with the reflected light. Either way, I stared for what felt like about 5 minutes which is a long time to be staring at a candle holder at 2-something in the morning. Eventually, I laid back down and fell asleep.

This continued to happen for about 5 or 6 days. Every time, I would wake up and my eyes would automatically fall on the candle holder - no matter which way I was sleeping. It wasn't as if I was looking for it - it was as if it was calling me. I was never scared of it. I looked at it every night for about 3-5 minutes, then went back to bed. The last time I saw it I did get scared, however. I remember that that night I wanted to be sure that what I think I was seeing was actually what was happening. I sat up straight, looking at it. Before this I never really focused on it - I just looked. This time I wanted proof. I tried to zoom in as much as possible without leaving my bed. It was only after a few minutes that I realized that the holder was not just spinning but floating about 2 inches above the TV. This is when I was scared out of my mind. I slammed back down on the bed and tried to sleep.

The next night, I awoke at night again (around the same time). This time I awoke frightened and shaken. I didn't want to move for fear of seeing the candle move again, so I just lay there trembling until fall asleep from exhaustion.

I would like to know if this is something beyond everyday logic or if I have some sort of disorder. I have many other experiences to share. I would really like to understand what has been happening to me. Any feedback is much appreciated. Until next time.

Strange Voices and Objects Moving,United Kingdom,Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: Strange Voices and Objects Moving

I 've lived in my home now for 5 years and nothing happened at first. But after a year of living here, I wake up with my bedroom lamp on every night until I unplugged it. Nothing happened for a while, until I was in the bathroom one night and I heard voices right in my ear, but I was to scared to listen to what they where saying. I have also heard my name being called a few times as well. 1 month ago I was in the kitchen and I heard a noise, at first I thought it was my dog growling, but when I looked to my left the cutlery draw was wide open. 2 weeks ago, I was recording my little sister singing when I played back the recording, there is a man's voice on there saying things that brought a tear to my eye, but only me and my sister were in the house, and no one in our family recognize the voice.

Objects around the house now and then go missing or get moved but it is scaring me now and I don't know what to do. Do you think it is a ghost? I am really scared that it could be a poltergeist. What shall I do?

"Bob, my Sister's Friend","Texas, United States",Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: Bob, my Sister's Friend

W hen I was younger, my family and I used to live in an apartment in El Paso. Every night my little sister would go into the corners and talk to a guy named Bob. She told us Bob used to live here, but I thought it was just her imagination. Then, really late at night, I heard voices. My little sister was sitting by the closet talking to a man, a least, that's how the voice seemed like. It was so creepy that I just left the light on every night until the fear just went away.

A couple of days later my parents kept on seeing a shadow of a man in the hall. Then at three a clock in the morning we heard knocking on the front door. My dad decided to stay up and see who was knocking on the door. He heard knocking on the door but nobody was there. It was scary since we didn't know who or what was doing the banging. It was also getting worse with my sister talking to Bob and with banging.

My parents just decided to move and we got a new house. I don't know who lives there now, I'm just really glad I left. I really don't like it that my sister named a huge teddy bear Bob.

The Fort,"Washington, United States",Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: The Fort

W hen I was about twelve years old, I went to visit my dad, who lived in Washington at the time. We went to visit this fort, forgive me for forgetting the name. When we went into the fort, my dad, step mom, grandparents and I all went into one of the fort's rooms and after all of my family left the room, I heard a noise, like rocks moving on the ground. I got scared and ran to tell my family. The next room that we went into had this big metal door with one of those big round knockers on it. After my family left the room, I heard the knocker slam on the big door, again I ran out of the room and caught up with the rest of my family. The ghosts must of wanted to make sure I knew they were there.

Later on, we went to the top of the fort. My dad and grandpa wanted to go into the fort when they saw these stairways going down. I told them I did not want to go down there because I did not like the feel of it. So they went on without me. I waited about 5 minutes, and called to my father to make sure he was still there. A second later, I heard my father's and grandfather's voice reply to me saying ""Come on down, Mindi, Come on!"". So I went down the stairs into the room. When I got into there, there was nobody there. I went out of the room and saw my father and grandfather on the other side of the fort! I went to them and asked them if they told me to come down the stairs and they told me that they did not, and that they had been walking around the fort. That is when I knew that there were really ghosts in that fort!

Babysitting Night,"Indiana, United States",Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: Babysitting Night

O ne Saturday night, I was babysitting this little boy. I told him it was time to go to bed and put him in his room. As soon as I placed him in the bed, he started bawling, so I said I'll stay in there until he falls asleep. He wouldn't stop talking, then he just stopped and stared at the window. He started crying, and I got this freaky feeling like someone was watching us through the window. Just as scared as he was, I told him he can sleep in the living with me (with the TV on!). We were watching full house, and someone started knocking on the kitchen door. It was like 10:00 at night, and I guessed it was the parents. I thought that this was the end of this freaky night, but then I stopped walking. I never saw the headlights coming toward the driveway, or heard a car. I looked out the peep hole and no one was there. The little boy started crying again, and I called his parents. They said they were going to be home in a half of an hour. Relieved that it was almost over, someone started tapping the window! The little boy started crying harder. Trying to be the adult, and not be scared, but it was really hard! As I soothed him down I told him mommy and daddy would be home soon. Well his parents arrived, and they paid me.

I walked outside to the car, and I noticed something moving. I'm not sure what it was, but I'm pretty sure. I looked over and I saw a man laughing at me, then he just turned around and walked away. That was one of the scariest nights of my life. One month later the family moved out, they said that they had been seeing this man. They said the man was always laughing at them.

M e and my friend Jacob were playing in my basement with all the lights off and only the smallest gleam of light. I was standing behind a hot water heater and Jacob was coming toward me, but he was crouching. I couldn't see him, and didn't know he was there, but then I saw a shadowy figure slowly walking through the doorway to my right, and the air around me got cold, I thought it was Jacob, and I was going to turn and scare him, but didn't. Then I heard this big bang in front of me and it was Jacob crouching on the floor, he had slammed his hand on a drier, and he was there the whole time. He said to me that he saw the same figure in the gleam of light a couple seconds ago. The gleam was in my sister's bathroom, so nothing could have gotten in or out.

A Grandmother's Promise and the Ghost Girl,Ireland,Family / Friends Visits,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Family / Friends Visits :: A Grandmother's Promise and the Ghost Girl

W hen I was 16, my grandmother took really ill, she was 95, so I quit my studies to look after her. My parents died when I was very young, I don't remember them, it was always me, my brother and my grandmother. Sitting up late in hospital one night talking, I told her I was afraid if she died because I'd be on my own, she was my best friend, she held my hand and we made a promise to each other that whoever died first would come back to let the other know they where fine. Two months later my grandmother died.

After a few months, I eventually gave up on my grandmother coming back to reassure me. A friend of my brother was in his house with us and she had just bought a new mobile phone. Not knowing how to work it, she handed it straight to me to set it up for her. As I was fiddling with the menu, a call came through... I recognized the number and answered it... Nothing but dead air. Hanging up it took me a couple of seconds to realize that the phone shouldn't have rang. No one had the number, I'd just taken it out of the box. It started ringing again... The number was 01232 721784, my grandmother's number.

Her phone was disconnected a few weeks before she died. I believe it was my grandmother fulfilling her promise.

A few months ago, I was watching a program about haunted hotels, there was a story about a little girl who's mother abandoned her at the hotel in the early 1900s. The little girl drowned in a stream, or something, outside the hotel and her ghost is said to appear to women staying in the hotel. People who have seen her have said she calls them mommy. That night and for a few weeks after, I kept having dreams about this little girl, she was screaming for me, calling me mommy, but I couldn't reach her. A few weeks later, I was ill and went to my doctor, he told me I was pregnant. I have a medical condition where I supposedly can't have children, I'm 5 months pregnant as I write this, me and baby are doing great... Though my doctor is stumped.

Angelic Dream and Devilish Presence,"Texas, United States",Misc,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Misc :: Angelic Dream and Devilish Presence

A few months ago I had a dream where I felt a presence in the room. It was so real. In the dream it felt like there was an angel at the right foot of my bed and roaring sound. Also, a presence on top of me that felt it was the devil. It was scary! When I hear a clear word I could make out from the corner where the roar sound was I heard ""JEWEL...I AM JEWEL"". I woke frightened. After examining this dream and talking about it, I felt JEWEL was my guardian angel helping me wake up from the fear of the presence on my comfort or... I had someone else suggest that JEWEL was an ancestor trying to get in touch with me. Here is the dream below.

Tony got up for work. I got up with him. After he left, I went back to bed  and pulled the comforter up to my neck. I started contemplating if I should go back to sleep or just get up for the day. I started to fall into a half awake half asleep feeling. I knew I was dreaming at this point and felt a presence in the room. In my mind I was thinking of an angel in my dream. I started to feel pressure on top of the comforter at the bottom of the bed on my feet. It started working its way up my legs with heavy pressure. I heard a whirling wind sound at the end of the right foot of the bed. I was scared! I remember hollering ""SHANNA"". The pressure got heavier and moving up my body towards me... I was getting more scared and heard words come out of the whirling wind sound. It was ""Jewel"" or ""I am Jewel"". I yelled out loud in my sleep ""NO"" and woke up. I got up for the day scared to fall back asleep. I went to work telling Renette. We were freaking out. I came home that evening still intrigued by the dream. I got on-line and begin to research ""Angels, Jewel, etc."" I came across a bunch of Angelic web sites. I dove in and begin reading for an hour. I came to a paragraph that read at www.askanagnel.org:

""There is a jewel nature to your soul. The jewel of your soul. The quality, the nature, the shape, the tones and the colors, the very vibration, the very emanations of this jewel reflect your soul nature, and the gifts that in this lifetime you have chosen to embody. We amplify the jewel nature of your soul. We amplify the highest, purest, truest emanations of your soul which are in alignment with Creator and with creation. We amplify your ability to connect with the gifts that you carry within you. We work with you to open your willingness to experience your own gifts within, to see and know them as pure expressions of love, to hold them, both sacred and true, and pure, and yet to share them with no holding. With no reservation. With no concern of how they are accepted. We stress this last part, that you have no concern, that you have no expectation, that you have no demand upon those whom you give your gifts to.""

My conclusion to the dream: Through my soul searching, I've questioned a few times if we should expand the shop or should sale out and move with Tony to the Hill Country. I feel like this was an answer to follow with the expansion. That the gifts given to me are the Jewel nature of my soul. The creativity is a God given gift, and meant for me to share it through my business. Also, I am in ""The Word"" and hungering for the knowledge of Christ, and growing in Christ. I feel like Satan could have been the presence on the comforter and my ""Guardian Angel"" was the whirling wind who spoke ""Jewel"" to wake me up from the dream. This may sound crazy, but it happened... It happened to me. So until you walk in my shoes... Think what you want!

It was right before Tony had to get up for work. One of my life long fears has always been something under my bed. I still at 35 run and jump in the bed at night. Tony cracks up. Well, in this dream it began like this... I was laying on my back. I felt the comforter on my right left flip over to the left leaving my leg exposed. I then started sliding down the side of the bed in slow motion being pulled to the ground right next to the bed. Pulled to my fear. I was reaching towards Tony (who was still sleeping) and started to try and holler his name. When I started to holler ""Tony"" I could feel the voice in my gut and coming out of my mouth and it sounded and felt like a deep devil voice. Tony turned and looked at me. It was not Tony. He had a very very scary face. Brown/yellow protruding front teeth, evil eyes. He pulled me up the bed next to him, and turned and put his tongue in my mouth. It was not Tony's tongue. It was like a thin wiggly snake. I woke up FREAKING out! I just snuggled next to Tony and started to fall back asleep. I started dreaming this same dream again. The cover flipped off my leg. At this point I knew in my dream it was happening again. So I begin to holler only is sounded like mumbling to Tony... Thank goodness he heard me, cause he yelled ""Shanna your talking out of your head"". The sound of his voice brought instant comfort to me. I woke up and stayed up!

Tony kept picking at me that day talking to me with that devil voice... he is a hoot. Once again... It happened. Sounds crazy, I know it was a dream, but truly weird!

I can't believe I didn't submit this first. My Angelic Dreams / Devilish presence began soon after my grandpa's death on Labor Day weekend. I took this photo 3 hours after his burial. My grandpa had a look in his eye at me in the hospital out of all 35 people that were there. Also, my Aunt was on a missionary trip in a village out of state and told me she woke in the middle of the night with me heavy on her heart about death! SCARY! She said everything is going to be ok though. I went to a psychic... Oh my gosh I can't believe I admitted that, because I don't really believe, but was relieved I admit when she told me my life expectancy is 76. She said I will have a few stumped toes and bruises in life. It's funny be cause my little mind is always busy busy.

I took this picture 3 hours after grandpa's burial. Because I saw rays (a whole other story) that I relate to as angel wings. I pulled over on a busy rode and took it with a cell phone. I took off driving again texting this picture to everyone in family on my cell phone. They started replying back freaking out so I pulled over to examine the picture and can see 2 angels. 1 on top blowing horn and 1 on bottom with a sword. i still don't know what it means and why the dreams have started since Grandpa's death, but I believe him and grandma are together now.

Hopefully some comments might give me some direction on this.

Too Much for Me to Take,Ireland,Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: Too Much for Me to Take

H i, my name is Brian and I'm from Swords, in Dublin. I've lived in my parents house for the past 19 years and a lot of strange stuff has happened during that time, from lights flashing on and off to radio stations tuning themselves in. I'm 21 now and it seams that most of the stuff that has happened in the house mainly happened to me.

I've heard a lot of stuff in the house and have got used to it, then one night I woke from my sleep and I couldn't move or speak. I hated when it happened but as it happened so many times I started to get used to it to, one night in my bedroom, I had just laid new wooden floors in my room and I was sleeping on the floor on a mattress. I turned the light off and was ready to go to sleep, as I'm a messy person, I had left all the old chopped up floors in the corner of my room, I was just about to fall asleep and I heard the loose wood being moved up and down my floors in my room as if they were been pushed up and down. When I opened my eyes there was a man all dressed in black, just standing over me and looking down at me. I couldn't see his face clearly, and to tell you the truth I sh**t myself. My mom's friend has a 6th sense and she has also saw the man on a few occasions and also two woman at different times. But this is what I'm more worried about.

I moved out of the house 3 weeks ago to become a man and I'm now renting a house with my friend, a 5 minutes walk from my parents house. The first night was deadly, we had a few drinks (you know the usual). Then about a day or two later, we started to hear noises in the house and we put it off to being next door. The friend I'm living with never believed me and always laughed when I told him what happened in my mom's house. I've since had to check every room in the house and the wardrobes on 5 different occasions because I thought there was someone in the house. Noises of footsteps up stairs and banging of presses and doors.

On wednesday night, I was in bed and was just dosing off until I heard the front door open and close. When I opened my eyes, I couldn't move, it felt like a tone of bricks on me, I did sh**t myself at first but was able to talk myself out of being afraid. I was stuck like this for about 5 minutes and while I was like this, I could hear whispering, but couldn't make out what it was saying. Then I started to wonder if it was following me, I know it's a bit crazy but ah well. Stuff has been happening all week but last night took the biscuit. Me and my girlfriend were laying on the bed talking and we heard what sounded like a man whistle, I wasn't going to say anything because I didn't think she heard it, but she did, we both went white and were going to leave the house.

Now this is where I need help. I'm going to bless the house tonight and I don't know what's going to happen. I phoned a priest and he said it should be ok. What should I do? Please help, thank you.

Apparitions of my Grandfather,"Florida, United States",Family / Friends Visits,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Family / Friends Visits :: Apparitions of my Grandfather

M y grandpa died right before I was born and he couldn't wait until I was born, he died 3 days before. Way back when my mom had a room mate, she was at work one day and her roommate julie was on the couch watching T.V. She heard noises in my mom's bathroom and thought my mom was home so julie yelled across the house at my mom to stop making such a racket and it stopped. An hour later, julie fell asleep on the couch and after an hour of sleep she woke up to the noises in the bathroom. She ignored it and started watching T.V. again. She saw something funny on and called for my mom but she wouldn't answer so she got mad. 5 minutes later my mom walked through the door and julie started yelling at her. She said ""kim, why were you making such a racket in your bathroom? And why wouldn't you answer me when I called you?"". My mom said she had been at work ALL day. Julie got really scared and told my mom what happened. My mom didn't know so they shook it off. It was my grandpa, I am sure.

I have seen him. Yesterday, I was home alone, in the kitchen, singing at the top of my lungs to a song on disney channel and I looked at my bed room door and I saw him. My grandpa a gray... blackish figure, I was freaked and I immediately called my friend courtney. I told her what happened and all she said was ""wow"" but I forgot about it. Every time courtney is at my house he comes out and we would both see him and say ""MP"". It's a code word for ""I see a ghost"".

Do you guys think he's trying to tell me something? I miss him even though I never knew him.

Moving with Shadows,Senegal,Apparitions / Voices / Touches,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Apparitions / Voices / Touches :: Moving with Shadows

I t all started when I was very little. I moved around a lot ever since I was a baby. When my family moved to Saudi Arabia, the nightmare started. It started when I sneaked into my sister's room while she was having her slumber party. She was telling ghost stories and joking around. She told so many I can barely list them all. A few days later, I started feeling breezes in my room. Then a dark shadow would appear in the corner of my eye. Every time I looked to see what it was, nothing ever seemed to be wrong. But deep down I knew something was there... Watching me. So we moved from house to house.

Now we lived on this island and we had a beautiful house. In my room alone, I hadn't felt that cool breeze in a long time and I had forgotten it until that one night. I felt this breeze in my back, it sent shivers right through me and then there it was, the dark figure that appeared in the corner of my eye. I decided to pay no attention to it. Then the age came where I was still young but was allowed to stay at home alone. I was watching T.V calmly when the T.V switched off. I got scared easily and didn't try to turn it back on. Out of nowhere came a whisper that clearly was calling out my name... In a slow but crackling voice. I ran through the entire house but nothing was there. Again I decided to ignore it.

I still even now, after when we moved again, hear that voice and see that shadow. I scares me a little more every time. It's been going like that for ten years and I just can't explain it. People that I know think I'm crazy, well at least the few I have had the courage to talk to, until now, I have kept silent. Though I still don't know what has been following me around for so long.

The Pain and the Dream,New Zealand,Misc,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Misc :: The Pain and the Dream

O nce or maybe twice a month, I get this pain in my shoulder. I'm not sick or anything, I just get this really spiritual / psychic pain. It's nothing like I have felt before. It all started two months ago in january, I was checking my mail then all of a sudden I felt as if someone was pushing right through my shoulder out the other side and a blade to my throat. I started screaming but I bitted hard on cloth and it still wouldn't go away. Half an hour later, the pain evaporated and I felt nothing but cold chills going down my back.

The next day, I found it hard to wake up. I had a dream where a man with a hood was holding three captured people. There was a girl around 13 on the left and a young man, around 19 or 20, was on the right and a girl in the middle, around 15. They were all tied to their backs and blindfolded with a black gag in there mouths. Two of the prisoners were sent free. The 13 years old girl and the young man. Each time I had pain in my shoulders, this dream replays, not letting it go. I don't understand why... It freaks me out to much to say... Well the 15 years old girl was killed, the others were sent free because the girl said she'll give her life for theirs and the man accepted.

She wasn't shot because he had no guns, he took out a long blade and put it to her throat and well, you can see what happen. She was left in the snow and it seemed to rain at the same time. I was told that when it rains while it snows is an Omen... But I haven't looked it up yet. During my dream I will hear a voice, a voice screaming at me and I start crying and struggle to wake up. Then, when she's done screaming, I wake up. Sometimes I think I can hear her when I'm reading or typing on the computer or doing school homework. I sometimes see her dark figure in the snow looking through my mirror at me. I even feel a dark cloak of someone standing beside or behind me and I feel my heart choking.

I don't know what this means. And I want to know more about what's happening. I've never experienced something like this. If you can please leave a message to help me.

The Cooinda Ghost,Bahamas,Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: The Cooinda Ghost

C ooinda is only 225 km from Pine Creek, in the N.T, in Australia. I was camping out there for my last night on a fishing safari and ready to take the long drive back to my home town, Katherine, which is 300 odd kms or more. It was probably 3:00 in the morning when I heard someone shout out ""Holy Shiat!"" Me, my mates and a few more campers ran over to the toilet block (which was 500m away) to see what was the commotion. Before I go any further, I want to add a little info: The Cooinda area is full of mysteries and has plenty of sightings of ghosts, bunyips, etc. We all got over there and the man, who we all voted as the man who shouted out, was shaking and was pale as a vanilla ice-cream. He was staring at the mirror, with a message written on the steam from the hot shower, ""Thy beware as one's soul may be taken""! The man swore that he was the only one is the toilet block and he heard no one else go in. And to make things twice the commotion, while looking into the mirror again, the toilet doors started to bang and close by themselves. Everyone ran out (including me and my mates) back to camp, ignoring the faint sounds of the toilet doors.

The next morning, I went for my shower in the same toilet block and everything was dead still, nothing moving and all. I had my shower and got out and then I heard a bloodcurdling scream (woman I think) from the toilet block. I was scared shiatless! I went to look by, no one was there, I told the receptionist before leaving, she surprisingly heard it too, and the mystery still remains as the ""cooinda ghost"".

Succubus,"Illinois, United States",Succubus / Incubus / Sexual Ghosts,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Succubus / Incubus / Sexual Ghosts :: Succubus

I have been going through these sleep paralysis states lately. I will start off with the first one I had,  as embarrassing it is to me. I'm almost 100% sure I had an out of body experience.

I got up from my bed. Everything had this light bluish color. I didn't recognize anything wrong, it was around 1:00 a.m. I had a couple of buddies sleeping over, and I kind of deserted them and slept in my bed because it's ten times more comfy. So I got up and didn't bother to look behind me. I walked to the window. I thought to myself I should go down and join my buddies. Suddenly this over powering force grabs and pulls me back into the corner of my bed. And it starts feeling my upper body, I can only see these female hands, all I know is it felt really good. And this thing start kissing the side of my rib cage. I wake up in the corner of my bed. I'm certain this wasn't a dream.

The second time it happens I was in my bed. I was thinking about sleep paralysis because my dad just recently told me he was part of some project called the star gate project that has to do with RV, aka remote viewing, which was really shocking. I was thinking about it. And trying to get into the state. And the next thing I know, I'm paralyzed, but somehow I was bending my neck forward. And what I saw was a females hand, very pretty hand. I couldn't see the face, all I saw was a naked shoulder, breast and hand. It started to stroke my body. And my pants were half way down. I remember I wasn't scared, I enjoyed it if anything, if felt really good. Like some sort of amazing soft tinglish touch. It made me want to literally have sex with it.

I read stories about this succubus that sucks the life out of men. If someone has experienced something similar to this, please tell your story.

Gun Alley,Australia,Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: Gun Alley

G un Alley. Home to one of the most famous people in the N.T, who sadly died not long ago. He owned a business there, Gun Alley Gold Mining. It was very successfully, until he died! His wife claims she can feel him, his presence in the business, but I did not believe her at all. So, I decided to investigate.

Down the old dirt track to the old rickety house you might say, like out of a horror movie. The house outside had gold panning trough, water, a stand with axes and saws and all and a few lemon trees. I pushed open the door with the loud creeping sound echoing in the house. His wife come up and greeted me and said ""I'm heading down to shops to pick up few groceries, and I'll bet I see you running in... Well, five minutes!"" I laughed and went in and sat down to watch the TV. A couple of minutes went past and I heard my stomach grumbling so I decided to get something to eat from the kitchen. I walked around the wall and it was dark, not pitch black, just dark. The only light was from the windows.

I went to the fridge to get a loaf of bread out and I felt someone rubbing there hands on my back, I got up hitting my head on the fridge to turn around and see no one. ""Hello..."" I called out, ""Anyone here"". No one answered so I continued to search for my ideal lunch I was meaning to have. When I finished with the kitchen, I went back to the lounge room to find that everything was re-arranged! The seats weren't where they were before and the TV was turned to a different channel. I was starting to get creeped out so I sat down and watched the TV. I heard footsteps, loud footsteps coming here. I shot up and to find that I fell down head first because the chair I was sitting on was floating in mid-air.

At this stage I was ready to run out when all the doors were locked automatically, I went for the windows but they were locked but I took no chance, I smashed one window and climbed out with massive scratch marks all down my side, and a journey I would never forget...

Min Min Lights,Australia,Orbs / Lights / Mists,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Orbs / Lights / Mists :: Min Min Lights

M in Min Lights have to be the most frightening experience ever yet. Around the Boulia region in south-west Queensland, mystical orbs roam the country side, scaring cattlemen and causing major accidents to drivers and truckies.

I was driving from Innamincka, which is not so far from Boulia, to Boulia and up to a place called Mount Isa, when I noticed a pair of ""headlights"", tailgating behind me. It was getting really annoying after five minutes and I was begging him/her to overtake, but he/she wouldn't. So I decided to slow down to piss him/her off. Then, all of a sudden, the so called ""headlights"" turned out to be ""Min Min Lights"". I stopped the car, hearing the screech of the tires behind me as the Min Min Lights flew around the car.

I was searching for my camera to take a photo when one of the Min Min Lights got closer to my car. It hovered closer and closer almost blinding me, then it just dissolved as the break of dawn was coming up.

I never ever want to go there again, and I'm sure you won't as soon as you seen the Min Min Light.

Two Ghosts in my Room,United Kingdom,Family / Friends Visits,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Family / Friends Visits :: Two Ghosts in my Room

T his is really weird for me to tell, as everything happened so fast. All this is true, and it means a lot to me that I think I should share it with people. When I first moved into this house I was fully aware the last owners were an old couple who lived here and both died. I have the master bedroom and I see her walking in my room a lot. She tries to talk, but we just can't do it. I have a feeling her husband has made it into heaven and is sleeping peacefully, as I've never seen anything to do with him. I've seen the old woman, I can see her in the shadows of my TV screen on my wall. She stands there and she waves to me. I didn't see her for a while after I redecorated her bedroom, now I think she stays downstairs in the living room, no one can walk in it between 3-4 am in the morning. If you didn't know, that's the time spirits come out and God cannot do anything about it. I don't quite know how this is true but I've been told.

Also, yesterday, my boyfriend died. I'm certain he tried to contact me in my dreams last night. He was telling me things he didn't manage to say to me when he was still alive. I think he was trying to say ""goodbye"" to me, and ""I love you"". Luckily, ""I love you"" was the last thing he ever said to me, which was over the phone, so it meant quite a lot as I didn't see him a lot. I've noticed today, as I've been sitting in my room, I can feel him there, I know he is, I just can't see him. I feel someone rest there hand over mine as it's on the mouse on my computer. My hair is being played with, things are moving, my bed is creasing. Things are moving in my room, but only specific things, the stuff that had something to do with him. The stuff we messed about with, drawings, everything to do with him, which is why this is so odd. I wish I could contact him, just to say goodbye. I'm sorry I never really made the perfect girlfriend but I wish I could say it. I need to tell him.

So like I said, it's rather weird, but that's how things are going here at the moment. I currently have 2 ghosts in my room. One of which shares my bed with me at night. I just wish he knew how much I loved him. I know it's not much, and it sounds like crap as it's from a 15 year old girl, but that's my first story to tell.

P.S. If anyone knows of any spiritualist churches in nottingham / derbyshire please contact me, telling me how to get there. Thank you.

Grandfather's Ghost Saved the Day,"Illinois, United States",Psychic / Medium,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Psychic / Medium :: Grandfather's Ghost Saved the Day

T his is the first time I've actually sat down and written about the experiences that I've had, and I tend to ramble on so I apologize in advance.

I'll start off by saying that I am a believer in spirits, and have been since I was quite young despite my parents trying to get me not to as a child.

My first experience that I can remember, was when I was about 7 years old. I was in the backyard, playing on the swing set, my sister and brother were somewhere else, my mom was in the house. I'm happily swinging away, when I heard a very stern almost harsh sounding older woman call my name. I looked up, and continued to swing when I heard it again, this time, the voice almost sounded mad. I jumped off the swing and went inside to see if Mom had called me. She looked at me like I was nuts, said everything was fine, and to go play again. But I wouldn't go back into the back yard, and wouldn't let my younger siblings back there either.

About an hour later, my neighbor (a man) called my parents and told them that there was a copperhead snake slithering around the swing set and settled under the shed (which was right behind the swing set). Dad called the exterminator, and when he looked, he gasped and said there was a whole nest of eggs. Mom then asked me why I had come in asking why she called my name sounding so harsh an hour before. I told her I didn't think it was her because the voice sounded older, like a grand mother. She then said ""well looks like you have an angel watching over you"".

After that happened, I seemed to always have very vibrant realistic dreams, and heard this ladies voice any time it seemed danger was near.

Fast forward about 12 years, when I was 19. I lived in a older house with a roommate. The house belonged to her grandmother who was in a nursing home due to advance Alzheimer. The room I had was her grandmother's old room. When I moved in I noticed an extreme peace in the room. About a month later, my roommate and I were talking and I found out that her grandfather had pasted away in that room (and actually in that bed I was using). It kind of freaked me out a little, but the peacefulness of the room calmed my fears.

About another month went by, when I started having really weird dreams again, but nothing that I could put my finger on. One night I went to bed kind of late, and fell asleep rather quickly. I had a very realistic dream that night. I went fishing (never fish) with my little sister. She had falling into the water, and took in a lot of water. I had her rushed to the ER, where the doctor said to keep an eye on her as she may develop an infection in her lungs and to call 911 if anything was to happen to her. After we got home from the hospital, my sister began to have breathing problems. And then I woke up, wide awake (an oddity for me). As soon as I woke up, I had paged my boyfriend (back in the day of pagers) and began to wonder if anything had happened to my sister. I was about to call and make sure everything was ok when I had heard sirens. I thought for sure I had called 911 in my sleep (as a child I would act out my dreams), I paged my boyfriend again. As the sirens got closer and closer, I tried to think of a logical explanation for the police. I looked out my window to see my street filled with police cars, fire trucks, and an ambulance. Filled with fear, I watched the EMT's walk up to my next door neighbor's house.

I was confused, I watched for an hour, and then saw them bring my neighbor out on a stretcher. I worked for the police department, and was the one that actually filed away all of the 911 reports, so I pulled it up. The report stated that an unknown woman called at 2:53 about her neighbor that needed medical attention right away, gave the address and hung up. I went and talked to the neighbor's wife and asked what had happened. She was at a family's member house that night, when someone had called and said that he needed help. He had had a heart attack and fallen, and couldn't call himself. Once he was released from the hospital I asked him if everything was ok. He smiled at me, and said thank you. I asked him what he meant. He said that when he fell he called out for help, his old neighbor (my roommate's grandfather) came to him and said you will be ok, and I'll get you help). He said he watch his old friend walk from his house to my room (it faced his living room) and next thing he knew help was on its way.

Now I don't know if I had just picked up on something or if he knew that I was more perceptive to things happening, and would act out on a dream. If that was the case, then why would the dream be about my sister (who is totally fine, nothing wrong at all with her), unless he knew that would be the most effective way to get through to me.

Either way, my old neighbor lived for many more years, and thanked me almost every day for saving his life.

That is just one of my stories, I'll try and get the others together for a later date.

Someone Saying My Name,"West Virginia, United States",Apparitions / Voices / Touches,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Apparitions / Voices / Touches :: Someone Saying My Name

I was getting ready for bed the other night and I was checking to see if my little sister was ok and asleep. I went and told my parents goodnight because they were already in bed. I took my dog with me and I went to bed. I was getting all comfy and it was all quiet and all and I was laying there on my back and getting ready to fall asleep and all of a sudden someone said my name in my right ear. It was all clear and just perfect, I couldn't tell if it was a women or a guy but what ever it was, it said my name. I just ignored it and I went to sleep.

I told my mom about it and she said she couldn't understand what it could have been. So I have no clue what it was and why it said my name. And when it happened before,  I made sure it wasn't my little sister trying to scare me, so I got up and looked under my bed and nothing and I went into my little sister's room and she was sound asleep so I don't know what it was. If you have any clue could you tell me. Thanks.

Friendly Ghost Walking Around my Bedroom,United Kingdom,Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: Friendly Ghost Walking Around my Bedroom

T he other week I had just got in bed when I felt the covers around my legs get really tight and my body went very cold. I could see the covers being pressed down and I saw two hand prints at the end of my bed on one side. I kept on looking towards the end of my bed and then saw a figure looking straight back at me. Later that night, as I was drifting off to sleep, I heard a voice say ""hello"" into my right ear. After that, I sat up in my bed for the rest of night to see if I could see it again, but I didn't.

A couple of days after, I saw the same figure standing at the side of the bed, looking straight at me and it looked happy. But it sometimes annoys me because I keep seeing it every night, walking around near my bedroom and in my bedroom. I have found out that my brother kept on seeing it when my bedroom was his. We don't know who it could be, but it seems to like me and I don't want to get rid of it. I am going to try and communicate with it the next time I see it. I am going to try and get it on camera or on an audio device.

The Abandoned Mine in the Mendenhall Valley,"Alaska, United States",Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: The Abandoned Mine in the Mendenhall Valley

M ost of the paranormal encounters I've shared have occurred in my home. This one, however, took place miles from my home and only I was the witness. I live in the Mendenhall Valley in Juneau, and the high school I attend is downtown, so it's quite a ride just to get to school and back. Sometimes, my family and I go for a car trip and just drive around downtown out of sheer boredom. On this occasion, it was my parents' anniversary and my dad wanted to show my mom this neat trail he'd noticed while at work. We all got in the car (me, my brother, and our parents) and drove downtown. The trail leads up one of the mountain sides and the hike, if you go all the way, takes about a day. We decided to just walk up the trail to the old entrance to one of the mines that are scattered around here.

All of these mines are closed down and have been for decades. Because of this, they are dusty and dark and just plain creepy. Anyway, once we got to the old mine, outside, there was this little exhibit that showed some of the old tools used in the mines. My parents and brother were checking that out while I wandered around aimlessly (I seem to have a short attention span). I started kicking this rock around and it happened to land inside the mine. I followed it, and then I realized where I was. There was this rusted gate that had the sign, ""Closed, do not enter"" and stuff like that. About ten feet or so past the gate was this really big pile of rocks that sealed off the rest of the shaft. I'd assumed that this was one of the many mines that had caved in.

It was mid afternoon, so when I started to get a chill, I noticed almost right away. The underground wind shifted direction and, instead of blowing towards me, it started to pull me closer to the gate. Inside, I could suddenly see four or five men dressed in these dirty white shirts and jeans with suspenders. They all had a pick on their shoulder and they stopped walking as they seemed to notice me watching them. They had no eyes, just these black, empty holes, and I couldn't move. I was suddenly overcome with this feeling of absolute despair and fear. Simultaneously, the men stretched out their free hands and pointed their fingers at me, almost as if they were accusing me of something.

Next thing I knew, my mom had a hold of me and was shaking me and yelling, ""Tiffany, Tiffany, what's wrong? What happened?"" I realized that I was out of the covered entrance to the mine and I wasn't feeling quite so despairing. I answered my mom with, ""I'm fine,"" or something to that affect. Apparently, while I was watching the men, my parents and brother had started to hike back down to the car. My mom noticed that I wasn't with them and went back to find me. Once she got back to the mine entrance, she heard me making this horrible noise. She told me that she ran and grabbed me, saying that I was deathly white and staring at something that wasn't there and saying over and over, ""I didn't do it, I didn't do it"".

She pulled me away from the mine and then I was fine. I didn't even remember anything past seeing the men pointing at me, and I told her what I saw, but she didn't see the men and thought that I'd just had an episode or something. I forgot about it and didn't really think much of it. This happened in the middle of the day, around 2:00 in the afternoon, and we were no where near the river or our house. The more I thought about what I'd seen, the more I realized that those men must've died when the mine caved in. Why they accused me of it, I don't know. But I haven't gone there since. At least, not that far up the trail. The lower half is used as an outside run for gym class, and whenever I go on that trail, the spot behind my right ear starts to hurt and it gets worse and worse until I almost can't stand it.

Any one have any insight into why I might be feeling that? Any input would be welcome.

Ghost Shadows on the Wall,Australia,Misc,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Misc :: Ghost Shadows on the Wall

I am desperate for answers, I hope someone out there can give me some feedback on their thoughts of my event. This is the first time I have visited a site like this as I have been trying to find a similar story or some photos perhaps. Here's what happened:

A couple of nights ago my mother and I were alone talking in my lounge room. She was on the couch which is seated against a white colored wall. I was sitting opposite her and, as I was listening to her, I kept noticing a dark smoky ribbon-like shadow moving across the wall from the center of the wall to the left. This happened several times, until I asked my mum to come and sit next to me and watch the wall, as stupid as it sounds she did as I suggested. We both sat next to each other watching the wall and I wasn't crazy after all, she too saw this shadow moving across the wall. It then began moving across the entire length of the wall, then later in the opposite direction (from left to right). This continued to happen over a 2 1/2 hours period, with the shadow changing direction, speed and shape. Sometimes it seemed like a crescent / moon shape. Other times it looked like a closed hand turned to the side. The other thing is that occasionally we would smell some sort of strange, off-putting smell around us, then the smell would just disappear. I was terrified and frozen and began to cry, my mum was assuring me that it wasn't a bad thing and that I shouldn't be scared. I then asked her why it wouldn't go away / stop, considering how freaked out I was getting. (No I was not drinking and not on drugs).

Are my mother and I just both mad? Anyone with a similar story or information I would so appreciate hearing from you.

I was home one afternoon by myself, watching TV. I thought I had heard something in the kitchen, so I looked up and I froze... There stood a man that I had never seen before, yet he seemed very familiar to me. I couldn't move, or say anything. I'm not sure how long I sat there staring at this man, but the next thing I knew he was gone. My doors were all locked, no one could have come in. After that I saw shadows, and things out of the corner of my eye, but he never showed himself to me like that again.

Several weeks later I was at home with my parents, brother and niece and nephew. My dad and brother were standing at the counter. They wanted to show my mom and I something, so we looked in at them and carried on. Later that night, after everyone had gone, my mom and I were talking and she asked me if I had seen anything weird when we had looked in to the guys. I said yes, why? She said she had seen a little girl with long blonde hair standing between them smiling. I saw the same little girl. My niece and nephew were in the living room at the time, and look nothing like this little girl, so we know it wasn't either of them.

Photos with Orbs,"Florida, United States",Photographs / Videos / EVP,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Photographs / Videos / EVP :: Photos with Orbs

I was flipping through photos attempting to find pictures to update my web site with. Take a look at what I found. The first set of pictures were taken by my husband on 2-3-06 at 9:33 PM within seconds of each other attempting to capture Diesel running. Take a look at the background and you will see our deceased dog's urn, Aspen, with a 3-ringed ORB around it.

The second set of photos is with Diesel relaxing. We noticed another ORB as it appears to be moving in the background. These pictures were taken on the same date of 2-3-06 at 10: 54 PM. The photos with the ORB was taken at 10: 55 PM.

We've been using this camera for a very long time, and this has never happened. We're continuing to look through all our photos to find anything else out of the ordinary. We'll keep you posted. I can also send hard copies of these photos if needed. Please let us know what you think.

Ghostly Phenomenons,United Kingdom,Misc,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Misc :: Ghostly Phenomenons

I 've never really thought anything of ghosts but that was until this happened. One night, I had my friend over for a sleep over, she goes to the toilet, I'm half way up the stairs looking at the bathroom door when it slammed shut! I assumed it was my friend until she asked ""did you shut the door?"". And I was even looking at the door when it slammed. Another time, I was sleeping in my mom's bedroom at night and I started to hear heavy breathing. Now, I know what your thinking, it must be me or my imagination right? But I held my breath and this carried on, so I shouted for my mom and when I did this, it stopped like as if it ran away before it got caught. One day I was playing on the game cube and I went upstairs to get something. I came back down and the TV screen became gray and white and fuzzy. I went in the other room to get something else, I came back and the TV was off. I asked my brother if he turned it off but he didn't. I've got another weird story. I was in the front room and I was sitting on the floor. I moved over and it was chilly, I thought nothing of this at first, but when I moved over again it got warm. I moved back to the place where it was chilly and it still was. It was as if there was someone standing there!

Doppleganger,Canada,Misc,"I would really like someone to give me an answer of what they think this is. This happened a while ago and I have never been able to figure out what or why this happened! I was at a sleep over, doing what all teenagers do at sleep overs. I went home in the morning and my mother said to me ""why did you sneak out last night?"". I told her that I didn't and I was at my friend's house where I said I was going to be. She then told me that she let me in the house that night and I went in my room and closed the door. My little brother even asked why I left that night after mom let me in. I told him that it wasn't me. He said ""yes"" because he had seen me. This has bothered me ever since.

I would like anyone to tell me what they think of this. I have experienced ghosts, ufos and sasquatch sightings. But I have mostly experienced ghosts ever since I was young. I have a few ghost stories to tell but this one in particular has haunted me. We were playing with a homemade Ouija board that night, but we never came into contact with anybody. I have heard that even homemade Ouija boards can work. Maybe it had something to do with that?

The Disappearing Hand,"Ohio, United States",Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: The Disappearing Hand

F or those of you who have followed my stories, some of you will recall the one of the haunted home . For those who haven't, you can find it under the Ohio section of this site or by checking my profile. But to bring everyone up to speed let us just suffice it to say the house was haunted by some very restless spirits.

One day when I was a teenager, my neighbor approached me and asked if I would like to earn some money by helping him clean up his basement. Now, I remind you I knew all about this house from first hand experience, but the lure of money was just too great and nothing ever happened there during the day, so I agreed. We began by removing a lot of junk that he had accumulated over the years, and then he wanted to start removing the dirt from under the house so that the crawl space would be bigger. Well, as I was the smallest, I was elected to do the job.

I worked for the better part of an hour digging away from under this house and just before I was to take a break, I uncovered something, a hand, it appeared to be the petrified hand of a baby holding a rattle. Now believe me at first I didn't know what to make of it, but being a little skeptical and not really being able to see all that well, I thought that maybe it was a doll's hand.  I put it in my pocket and finished clearing out the area I was working on. When I came out of the hole, a friend of mine was there and I told him about my find. Needless to say, he didn't believe me, so I took it out of my pocket and tossed it to him, he took one look at it and said ""that ain't funny man"", and tossed it back to me like it was on fire. I looked at it a little closer and it really did appear to be the severed hand of an infant, cut off just above the wrist. So I decided to toss it back to him and get him to take a closer look and see if he came up with the same conclusion. Well he decided he did not want to touch it again and he let it drop to the ground in front of him. We both saw where it had landed and not wanting to lose this find, I went to pick it up. I got to where it should have been and it was gone! We searched the entire area around where it had landed and even some areas where it couldn't have possibly gone, but it was no where to be found.

To this day my friend doesn't like to be reminded of that incident and he makes a wide path around that house. Now some of you may say this story is made up or that it really was a doll's hand, but you were not there and my friend and I both know what we saw and what happened afterwards, plus we knew the history of the house.

Kelly Joanne Bishop,United Kingdom,Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: Kelly Joanne Bishop

O ur school is called St.Barts. We are now in year 6 and have encountered a few ghostly happenings in our time in the juniors. We have seen a plaque in our hall saying ""kelly joanne bishop whom we all loved"", and so we assume she died, of what, we don't know. The girls toilets is where we have had these ghostly happenings and no, we are not crazy because other people have experienced things like we are going to tell you.

When we were in year 5, we and a friend were sitting on the same table. First it got chilly around me, then it went around to my other friend and in the corner of my eye, I could just about see someone standing next to my teacher. Then in year 4, our friend was washing her hands, she looked in the mirror and a girl peeped her head around the last cubicle door and smirked. She looked behind her and nothing was there, so she ran out the toilets. In year 6, the last cubicle was locked but we were certain no one else was in the toilets at the time. Then one day, I was in the second cubicle and no one else was in the toilets but I heard someone walking around in the first cubicle. So us and our friends did a seance and we asked ""kelly joanne bishop, if you are here touch someone, turn on the tap or show your self"". When we did this, funny enough, it worked and the tap turned on.

The Archeries Forest Haunting,United Kingdom,Apparitions / Voices / Touches,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Apparitions / Voices / Touches :: The Archeries Forest Haunting

M e and my mate Casey were out at our regular hang out place, The Archeries, a place with a park and a dark forest on the right. We were out at the park and casey really needed the toilet. The quickest way home was through the forest. We had never gone through this way because of the scary stories that go around and me and casey were nervous. When we were half way home and in the darkest bit of the forest, we heard a rustle close by. We both turned to look but nothing was there, so we carried on walking. When we heard the sound of a twig snapping, this time I looked all around and into a bush. When I turned around again casey was gone! I was so scared to be on my own, but more scared for casey, where did she go, who had taken her? I started running, looking behind me, when I ran through something like a cold patch of air. I looked around and saw casey, face white and looking terrified. I looked to the right and saw it, a ghost! We ran all the way home and haven't forgotten that horrid day.

Haunted House,Canada,Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: Haunted House

I would like to share a few stories of things that has happened to me. I don't know if we just move into the wrong houses or if some people are just more receptive to unearthly phenomenons. My mom and I lived in this cute little house. Nothing happened at first until a couple of months later. We were sitting in the kitchen having tea with my aunt and my cousin, when all of a sudden we hear this lady crying in the basement. We all looked at each other and we knew nobody was downstairs because we were all upstairs. We knew it wasn't a radio or t.v because there wasn't any downstairs. My mom suggested we peek down the stairs but as we came closer the crying got louder. So we decided to just listen upstairs. It continued for a few minutes then just stopped. I only heard this one time, I don't know if my mom heard it again.

I was sitting in a chair watching t.v in the same house when I felt like someone was watching me. You know that feeling of chills down your back? That's what happened. I turned to look behind me and I could see this red kind of see through hand coming at me like it was going to grab me. It was kind of late in the night and I was up by myself. I immediately jumped up turned off the t.v and hopped into bed with my mom.

Here's another story that happened in another house, about 3 years ago. This was an old 2 stories house that belonged to this old couple that both died. I don't know if they died in this house. Me and my friend were painting a piece of furniture downstairs. Just her and I were there, when all of a sudden the washer door just slams down twice. We both looked at each other and walked up the stairs slowly. She then told me that she was just sitting on the washer a few minutes ago and that the washer door was closed.

There is only one bedroom on the main floor in this house and it happened to be my room. Sometimes we could see little orbs of light in there. That bedroom was right beside the living room and one night, while I was watching t.v by myself, I could hear someone breathing hard, sort of snoring. I turned down the t.v and listened, sure enough, it sounded like someone was sleeping in the room when there was nobody in there. We used to hear someone walking around upstairs too.

I'm not the only one that heard these things, my husband and children used to hear these things too. Even my teenage daughter never wanted to be alone in that house. To this day, they still mention the old haunted house. The house is now empty but the guy who lives beside it says he hears things like slamming doors coming from the house occasionally. I don't believe that these spirits were out to harm anybody, maybe it was the old couple just living there with us.

This is the last story. Just before we lived in the old house, we lived in a trailer where we experienced a few freaky things. A few people, including me, used to see shadows in the shape of a person walking around in the trailer. This one night, everybody was in bed, except me and my husband. We decided to go to bed so we turned off all the lights and went to bed. About ten minutes go by and we are just falling asleep and the lamp in the living room turns on. We knew it wasn't any of us because the kids were sleeping and we were both in bed. Maybe it was the land we were living on because my husbands brother used to have a trailer about 2 meters from where our trailer was. The freaky thing is both of our trailers burnt down. His burnt quite a few years before our trailer burnt. We told his brother what we experienced and he said that they used to hear and see things too.

Ghostly Happenings,United Kingdom,Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: Ghostly Happenings

I was on the computer one night, my normal place. I was role playing when my glass of water slid right across the desk, in front of me, a few feet. It stopped quickly and I felt a cold presence. There was no watery trail coming from the glass of water, and no doors in the house were open. No screen doors either. There was a fan in the other part of the room, but I doubt that it can move a full glass of water. There was no pool of water around the glass, mind you, and the house was cold.

It was a Sunday. Early and cold. I got up to go to the bathroom. When I came back, I lay on my bed and played video games. Then, I felt someone rubbing my back. I assumed it was my brother and turned around. Nobody was there. I found no explanation for this.

It was a Saturday, about two weeks from the last incident. I woke up, stretched, and yawned. I turned around and heard someone say my name clearly in my ear, ""Kirby..."" I was freaked out and turned around to find nobody.

I never really felt comfortable in my room after these incidents. I wanted to find out more about ghosts, so I started watching Discovery Channel's show, A Haunting. I have learned much, but am still worried.

A Christian Perspective on Demons,"New York, United States",Demons / Possessions / Exorcisms,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Demons / Possessions / Exorcisms :: A Christian Perspective on Demons

I did not write this material to make anyone feel indifferent or uncomfortable if you do not believe in the same beliefs I have on demons. Furthermore, I tried to offer resources that are available and where I got some of my information I just wanted to offer this to help anyone and I am hoping it does. I have been in some bad place and I just hope I can help anyone. Also, sorry my comment is on the long side. Moreover, some of the things that I have written contradict with my Christian of today over the last 2 years I came a long way and I have been truly born again. I hope that I will not scare anyone's point of view on ""born again"" Christian's because we get a bad wrap sometimes and please do not look down on me or judge me because of the role that I am trying to pursue in being a pastor because of some of my past actions. Again I am just trying and hoping. If you are going to judge my character some of the message may be lost. I honest hope this just helps someone in need and I am not worried that it may reflect on my character The less honest people are with each other the more room the devil has to operate

MOST OF THIS MATERIAL THAT I WROTE IS ARE STATEMENTS OF OPINION

Hi all, this is quite an interesting story, and I think that I owe it to God and others for me to comment on the story. Let me first say that I am a religious man and try to live my life the most Godly way I can. I am currently a non-domination Christian, and I am studying to be a pastor. I believe in demons and spirits (this is a Pentecostal, a type of Christianity, type of belief). I recently became a Christian over the last 2 years before that I was a non -practicing Catholic and basically an atheist (someone who does not believe in God). Further, I never thought that I would be studying to be a pastor I am 25 years old, and I basically have a bachelor's degree in Business Law and an Associate's in Business Administration. I had all intentions of being a businessman for the rest of my life, but God had different plans for me altogether. Now let me tell you why I had to comment on this story and I hope that God can guide my fingers.

I became a Christian basically out of necessity. It all started similarly to this story for me. I had trouble sleeping, to say the least. I was not engaging in sexual activities in my dreams and or being forced to engage in sexual activities with demons I just was not sleeping at all. Basically, I could not sleep for a period of about 6 months; mine you that I was pretty much a sound sleeper for all my life until this point. At this point in my life I was living in complete sin, I was with a girl at the time who was the devil in disguise and this happened during our relationship while I was sleeping next to her in bed most of the time (we were not married, she was previously engaged and had a kid by another man, and I was there something that I am not proud of to this day, but we are all sinner until we met Jesus Christ). But back to the story I could not sleep at all and it felt like every time that I would lay down at night I would be wired. So like any other person would do I watched TV in bed and tried to read and do things to make me relax me to put me to sleep. Okay, I thought to myself during the beginning states of my ""insomnia"", that was not working (reading and watching TV to try and make me fall a sleep) it is probably just a fluke I'll be cool.

Then, one month when by, and I was still not sleeping. The only thing that gave me comfort was watching TBN (Trinity Broadcasting Network), and I was not even religious at the time. So I would flip and flip channels and hope that I would fall asleep. Then, not sleeping 2 months. Now it became 3 month and I was growing weaker and weaker by the day I remember that I did not want to do anything at all but sleep and I started to tell some people that I was having trouble sleeping my mom, my girlfriend Joan at the time, who I thank God everyday that I am away from now (that is a whole other story). I started talking to my brother and anyone else as often that I could gain support (my girlfriend was no support- I believe that my girlfriend was the devil, extremely demon possessed to some degree, which I will touch on later in paragraph labeled ""DEMON POSSESSED PEOPLE I'VE ENCOUNTERED"") So now I started to drink heavily to try and ""put myself out"" (make myself fall asleep) I would drink to the point of ""black-out"" (when your body just shuts down from consuming too much alcohol; it's like a body safety feature) and I still could not sleep. Sometimes I would sleep of about a half hour or something, and then I would be back up like I was on speed or something like that (I was not consuming any drugs at the time decides alcohol which is a depressant not a speed, stimulant I never was much of a drug user and to this day I do not use any drugs not just because I am a Christian and I believe that it is a sin or consume alcohol as well). The half hours naps would sometimes some what sober me up so then I would drink more ""black-out"" again and not fall back to sleep. I remember the 1st night that I kind of slept for the night (about 4-6 hours I think closer to 4 much closer) I drank 1/2 a bottle of vodka and swallowed 6 ""Benedill"" I asked the pharmacist, an acquaintance of mine at the time, where I worked what ""over-the-counter"" drug had the strongest sleeping agent and he said ""Benedill"". I was so happy that I actually fell asleep that night. I tied it again the next night and nothing I could not sleep again.

SLEEP FINALLY! A MIRACLE? THANK YOU JESUS! NEW FOUND FAITH, A NEW LIFE (BEING TRULY BORN AGAIN) AND A NEW PURPOSE

Anyway it took me 3 more months (for a grand total of 6 months) to start regularly sleeping again. The only way that I started sleeping again was through my Lord and now personal Savior Jesus Christ. It was truly a miracle (all things are possible through Christ who strengths me as it is stated in Philippians in the Bible) I slowly started to pray and Jesus put me to sleep even without alcohol or ""Benedill"" He was the best tranquilizer ever invented. I would go to bed still with Joan (the devil) and I would sleep for the first time since we started going out. I started to sleep every night again regularly, basically by praying, ""please Jesus put me to sleep please... God please put me out (to sleep)"" and I would say it over and over again, and at this time in knew pretty much nothing about demons (even that, now I believe that I was sharing my bed with one).

But this long time sinner of New York City started to become a Christian through the back door (or should I say through the mattress). And my life started to change, and I stopped going to college for business because I was too tired to go to school or do homework (during my 6 month ""insomnia""), although I never failed out (I started to have my sleeping problems around spring break of my junior year in business college, but somehow I still got all B's and C's and one F's in statistics class that semester). I, simply, went on summer break and never went back because I was not sleeping and I ended up working full time delivering pizzas. During the time I was delivering pizza I started to grow in faith little by little and God taught me more and more and send me messengers and saw God perform many miracle for me and hope that God would fix the wrong things in my life put me back in school and have a future again and he did that too just not in the business world like I expected and along the way God send me some messengers along the way when I needed them the most (Behold, I send my messenger before your face, who will prepare your way; Mark 1:2 New American Standard Version) Also, I believe that God has plans for people and that He controls all events in people's lives to either draw them closer to Him or farther form Him

Two of the most important messengers that pertain to this story that God sent for me was Mr. Harold (the man who truly introduced me to demons) and Gabriel (the man who taught me how to rebuke demons). Between the two of them they taught me that demons existed, that they can jump in and out of people, how to rebuke and the importance of rebuking them, and demons are all of the devil and they operate as all the different faces of the same devil.

Mr. Harold was the first person to teach me about demons (I did not truly know of demons until I met this man and he told me about them). He was a man that would come into the pizza shop that I worked at, and he and I got very friendly talking about religious things because I had became a Christian by this time and he was one too.

Secondly, a more important messenger that God sent was Gabriel, a Haitian man. I met this man by chance (the way that the Lord often works) I recently got my car taken, and I could not longer deliver pizza that is what I was doing for a living when times got bad for me. And what man can deliver pizzas with no car (please tell me that), but I was so blessed in the matter that my boss was letting me drive his mini-van (he also sold me 2 cars for cheap when I needed them to keep delivering- thank you Jesus) Anyway I had to take the bus home one night after delivering, and I met an interesting Haitian man waiting for a bus at a busy terminal in the city. I overheard some girl in distress because she could not find her bus because the bus pick-up locations had recently been changed by the transportation authority. In seeing this I got up and showed her pointing to the bus locater map where her bus was. Then, an African American man saw this and said to me, ""Why did you help that girl?"" I answered that I was a Christian but hesitated when I said it. He followed by saying to me, ""What is a Christian?"" And I answered, ""One who believes in Jesus Christ..."" ""Why did you hesitate when you said that you were a Christian,"" he questioned; and I did not know what to answer. But he continued talking to me and he told me that he was from Haiti and that he had been a preacher since he was 8 years old.

To make a long story short he taught me more about demons and importantly he taught me how to rebuke them that night. I recall asked him, ""How do you rebuke these demons?"" And he replied that you rebuke them in the name of Jesus (""I rebuke STATE THE NAME OF THE DEMON OR DEMON- POSSESSED PERSON THAT YOU ARE REBUKING you demon in the name of Jesus Christ through the blood of the lamb who died on the cross"" He followed and said that it is important to say in through the ""blood of the lamb"" and ""talk about the cross when rebuking the demon"". He followed and said, ""That demons do not like to hear about the blood of the lamb and the victory at the cross by Jesus""; furthermore, he continued, ""that the devil gets upset and gets mad that you are not worshipping him when people mention the blood of the lamb and the cross and just basically talk about God. Also, he told me that one time he saw a demon trying to coming into him form another man one time and he rebuked it (demons can jump into and out of people at will this Mr. Harold taught me as well and I believe it to be completely true). I was asking him questions and he was answering them we became instantly close. So I asked, ""How can you tell if someone has a demon in them?"" And he answered, ""that a person might show characteristics of anger or getting red in the face when one talks about the blood of the lamb, the cross, and God in general.

SIMILARLY PAUL BILLHEIMER WRITES ABOUT DEMONS AND REBUKING THEM IN DESTINE TO OVERCOME (I bought this book off e-bay for $6.00 and worth every penny too, and IT'S A MUST HAVE IN MY OPINION)

Paul Billheimer writes about demon's in his book Destine to Overcome (a book about the technique of spiritual warfare as Billheimer calls it; it's a great read on demons and the power of prayer/ rebuking in defense) He states that you should single out the demon and rebuke it. For example, Billheimer and I believe that depression is a demon; one would say to rebuke this demon, ""I rebuke you depression in the name of Jesus through the blood of the lamb thought Calvary's victory (the place Jesus was crucified). Further, Gabriel taught me ""thought the cross"" instead of saying ""Calvary's victory"" I believe that they can be used interchangeably heck use them both to be on the safe side. Billheimer states this on page 46:

When you discover that your trouble is the result of satanic or demonic oppression try speaking directly to the demon or demons, calling them by name and commanding them in the Name of Jesus and upon the basis of Calvary's victory to release you, to take their hands off and go back to the abyss, and stay there thought the blood of Jesus

Further, Billheimer states an interesting observation of what he believes is the cause much mental oppression in Destine to Overcome:

I am convinced that much oppression which we attribute to natural causes such as disposition, temperament, moods, fear and depression is demon inspired (page 42-43)

I had heard by other sources, and I believe, that these demons roam the earth and seek they do not rest until they get a host; as one notices in the medical world there is not clear cause for depression and it can happen form a number of things: drastic changes, lost of a loved one, basically anything can trigger it. But if one cuts there finger you know how it happened and you know how to solve it by putting a bandage on it mental problems are much different and I believe that they are demonic

Further, Billheimer elaborates about demons on a following page:

These evil spirits (demons) are self-conscious personalities who can hear and see and think and feel... They have all the attributes of personality except a body (page 45)

That is why I believe that they take a host in peoples bodies and people do not even know that they are there they think that it is them or it has become them that their personality has changed, but it is actually the demon I believe this with all my heart.

I believe that many people are demon possessed now a days, some more than others, and people just call them by their medical names schizophrenic's, bipolar, suffers of depression, suffers of anxiety etc.

Three people that I believe were demon possessed that I came into contact with were Joan, my ex-girlfriend, Tina, a girl that I worked with in a pizza shop, and Keith, a cabdriver that I met just to name a few

I believe Joan was very possessed with many demons including: anger, depression, lustful, bi-polarism, self mutilator and suicidal (she would try and slit her wrists when I would try and break-up with her or overdose on some type of drug) I believe that she was a schizophrenic, she was delusional and paranoid (she was extremely paranoid about things; for example, she thought that there was cameras watching her at one of her jobs. Also, she though one of my friends was trying to set me up and people were trying to set up to beat-up one of her friends), obsessed with everything to the point of having obsessive compulsive disorder, extremely possessive, lied all the time (basically a pathological liar), and she abused anything she would get her hands on from diet pills to drugs, recovering anorexic and bulimic. An interesting thing is that Joan tried every drug on the market to help her and none would the only thing that could help Joan was/ is Jesus Christ, but Joan would make rage-filled statements when I would be talking about God and say things in a nasty, cold, very angry, and stern way with her face red:

1) ""You know where I think we go when we die! We go into the ground!""

2) ""Now that you are holier than thow and you do not sin anymore!""

3) ""I believe that Jesus was the greatest story (lied) ever told and the Bible the biggest lie ever written!""

Another demon possessed person that I ran into was a cabdriver named Keith. Whenever I would take a cab home from the pizza shop (when I was without a car) I would usually talk to the cabby to make the time go by quicker. I built an acquaintance type of relationship, with a cabby, who would often take me home, and his name was Keith. One night we were talking about religion and Keith knew that I was a Christian and at that time I knew a lot less then I know today, but when I was talking and he cut me off became instantly cold (turning red in the face) and told me that I need to do some research on the things that I was talking about and he said that he read the Satanic Bible along with the really Bible front to back in a couple of days twice.

And another demon possessed person that I encountered was right after I broke-up with Joan for good (thank you Jesus), I met a girl by the name of Tina who started to work with me at the pizza-shop. To be honest I thought that she was cute; further, I kind of wanted to take her out on a date until I realized that she was just like Joan and equally demon possessed. By this point I was used to dealing with someone extremely demon-possessed regularly because I when out with Joan for a good amount of time (2 years) So I would quiz Tina randomly and see how she would react to learn more about demons. During the time I worked with Tina I saw her in anger flipped-out on a customer and tried to fight them because they were ""giving her an attitude"" (boy that reminded me of my ex). She had some type of OCD (obsessive compulsive disorder) she would wear basically new cloths into the pizza shop and some nights she was cooking and get angry rageful if they got dirty or stained. Another time she put bags around a new pair of boots that she bought that she wore to work one day (to keep them clean) (something else Joan would of done. She would get ragefully angry when she would stain and new article of clothing or any clothing in general).

Also, I felt and enormous feeling of lust around her like I just wanted to have sex with her; the only time that I felt that feeling was when I was around Joan (a person, who was the most promiscuous person that I ever met, by age 19 she had sex with 25 men 20 of them in a matter of the six months prior to the time I started dating her some of them were random encounters engaging in sex with men she knew for less then a day. The 6 month period was a period between her ex-finance leaving her and when I came along. Also, I believe that during our time together she cheated on me having sex with 3 other men one of them I believe to be some random man that she met during a fight of ours and had sex with him because she though that I was leaving her)

Another thing that I noticed was there was an intense feeling of depression when I was around Tina I drove her home one night and to her friend's house both which I did not want to but she conned me into driving her. I also felt this feeling during my time with Joan just a leveling depression I felt it when we first stared going out, and I felt that later with her I believe that it was one of her demon jumping out into me. Needless to say I rebuked both Tina and Joan as well.

This is a list that I came up with of possible demons, and I hope that it is helpful. This is not and all inclusive list and may not be right, AGAIN THIS IS MY OPINION

9. Obsessiveness (obsessive compulsive disorder); by this I mean not just the disorder but obsessing over things too Joan obsessed over everything especially her weight this was the reason for her eating disorder I believe.

Some people might say that are not mental illness in some regard hereditary? And I believe the answer would be correctly yes! Stating that demons roam around the earth until they find a host and who people around the most early on in life are their parents around the most their children. I believe that the demons that existed in the parent can enter the child. I believe that most people have many demons in them that they are unaware of it AND WATCH THEY CAN JUMP IN AND OUT OF PEOPLE WITHOUT PEOPLE KNOWING/ FEELING IT

I kind of developed a demon ""test"" or ""checklist"" my knowledge of demons has grown tremendously since I have met Mr. Harold and Gabriel. This is just some of the things that I noticed. Specifically, it is more like a list of observations that I have noticed in my experiences, and I hope that it can be helpful to you too. Further, not all demon possessed people display all these traits they may only display a few. AGAIN THIS IS MY OPINION

2. Just strange or weird acting; possibly schizophrenic personally traits; paranoia

3. Anger issues: rageful anger; hateful anger; could possibly be violent or attack people

4. OCD (obsessive compulsive disorder) or obsessive behavior; obsessive over things: events, people rageful over obsessions

7. A hollowness / emptiness in people; hollowness in their eyes, look of emptiness

8. Cold: do not care about things: people, circumstances; possibly accompanied by a sense of hopelessness

9. Incapable of self-control (outburst of anger possibly to point of violence emotional outbursts crying, screaming, and yelling etc.)

12. Lying all the time; maybe to cover for their actions; just general lying; political lying (lying for power to control things); may seam like a pathological liar

14. May appear friendly initially but true personality is cold;

Donald Juel writes his ""check-list"" on page 70 of The Gospel of Mark:

Evidence of demonic possession includes epilepsy-like symptoms (9:20-26), uncontrolled shouting (1:24; 5:7), superhuman feats of strength, and self-mutilation

{the parentheses are in the text of the book and refer the reader to the Gospel of Mark in the Bible where it is located and the reason that he placed these traits}

Joan would get mad and attack me, and I would have a subdue her at times and to be honest sometimes it was hard (superhuman feats of strength) she would also call my parents house yelling and scream stating that I beat her up when actually it was the other way around like she was trying to beat me up (delusional and uncontrolled shouting) self-mutilation she would try and slit her wrist when there was problem

WHAT TO DO IF YOU THINK THAT YOU ARE INFECTED WITH A DEMON OR BEING ATTACKED BY A DEMON: STAYING SIN FREE AND DEMON FREE

1. Rebuke it or them (using technique/ techniques listed above)

2. Stand strong in your rebuke (if you are rebuking a person do not associate with them. They may at fist try to associate with you stronger after the rebuke because the devil knows of the rebuke and he will fight it). Symptoms may get worst initially but that is very brief and so follows deliverance

3. Believe that it works have faith in God; if one lacks faith this will not work as effectively as it could (pray to God for faith if lacking)

5. Repent to God for any sin in your life and remove the sin in your life. We must constantly make sure that our life is pure before Him; further, make sure that there are not any sins habits or attitudes that God may be judging in our lives

if sin is in our life the devil (demons) is legally allowed to sift us (see Luke 22:31; 1 Corinthians. 5:5)

6. Read the Bible (the Bible is the word of God and is the only infallible source of truth), and stay in prayer these are the best medicines for anything supernatural; moreover, PRAYER TO GOD IS OUR SUPERNATURAL WEAPON USE IT!

I BELIEVE WITH AS LITTLE AS POSSIBLE SIN IN OUR LIVES THE CHANCE OF A DEMONIC ATTACK WILL LESSEN AND IF WE ARE SUFFERING FROM A DEMONIC ATTACK I THINK THAT IT WILL BREAK MORE EASILY. IT IS VERY IMPORTANT TO REBUKE THESE DEMONS AND NOT LET THEM STAY INTO YOU OR I BELIEVE THE LONGER THAT THEN REMAIN IN YOU THE MORE DANGEROUS IT WILL BE

Since Satan does not have a body and cannot be attacked physically-not in our own power or strength or wisdom but in the Name of Jesus! When at last in hesitation, in fear and trembling, I ventured to speak directly to him (the devil); calling him by name; commanding him and his demons of depression, oppression, affliction and bondage, in the Name of Jesus of Nazareth and upon the basis of His shed blood, to leave me and release me, I discovered immediate release and relief. It was as though the demons of doubt, fear and bondage instantly melted at the Name of Jesus and the blood of the Lamb when the word of command was spoken directly to them. Now, with the word of my testimony, I declared aloud that they had been destroyed by Christ's death and that their claims were cancelled, that they had no right whatever to touch me, that they were trespassers when they attempted to do so. When I did this, commanding them in the Name of Jesus to go, I experienced immediate relief and freedom

I similarly, felt that too. If you do not experience it try again because I promise you that it does work as God as my witness.

1. Read the Gospel of Mark in the Bible. (I think that the New American Standard version of the Bible is great get it if you can it is a lot easier to read then the King James in my opinion get it if you do not have one) The Gospel of Mark has a lot of demonic activity in it. Jesus rebuking demons etc.

2. Steve Sampson's Confronting Jezebel (discerning and defeating the spirit of control)

4. Paul Billheimer's Destined to Overcome (A MUST READ in my opinion about this subject) and Destined for the Throne (got it for $3)

Please E-mail me if you have any questions comment or concerns if I can help please let me know demonhelp1 [at] yahoo.com PLEASE DO NOT HESITATE. I just hope that I can help.

A Cat's Protection,"New York, United States",Misc,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Misc :: A Cat's Protection

T his may be nothing, but almost every night for the past two weeks (12-1 am) my cat acts very strangely. He likes to sleep next to my leg usually but lately the minute I get into bed and lean over to call him to me, he sits at the end of my bed staring at an area above my head/past my shoulder. There is little ambient light in my bedroom at night, due to double curtains I have installed to allow me to sleep in during the day, but his eyes almost glow as he stares unblinkingly. He is a talkative cat, and at these times he goes completely mute and wide eyed. I have gotten out of bed to pick him up and he will sit by my feet just staring - it has gotten to the point where when its bedtime I literally call out in my apartment ""Ok bedtime, goodnight everyone"" and he will wander up the bed and fall asleep. He is a strong presence while I sleep as well, the only times I can recall having nightmares - involving what I chalk up to being ""souls"" that aren't exactly nice, or possibly indigestion - is when he is asleep in the other room. Its like I have to have him near me to sleep well. It is an old apartment (around since the 20's, and from my understanding there has been only one family other than myself in the apartment (the landlords parents and then his sister), but there are times when I feel like I am being watched. I know with my cat I feel safer - he seems to be a calming force for me. The funniest thing, he was a jet black cat, until this past Christmas when a white patch started growing above his right eye.

Hooded Apparition,"New Mexico, United States",Apparitions / Voices / Touches,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Apparitions / Voices / Touches :: Hooded Apparition

I was about 31 years old and about 5 months pregnant, not drinking or drugging, in May of 1985, visiting my Mom and Dad in New Mexico. They lived in a brand new 2 story Spanish style home at the north end of Albuquerque. Everyone had retired to sleep and I was dozing off in the guest room on a daybed facing away from a large arched window that faced a street light. So it was not a really darkened room. After a few attempts to close my eyes, a robed figure stood facing away from me, maybe 4 feet in front of me, I really truly thought it was my Mom, (maybe she had been drinking and was sleep-walking?) I said ""Mom?"" and it stayed where it was so I sat up on my elbow and repeated louder and with more force ""MOM!"". Well, I got it's attention and it began to turn slowly towards me and then I realized it was not my Mom and every hair on my body stood up and it just vanished right before my eyes. I was so shocked I just knew it had to be my Mom so I jumped up through on every light in the room, as well as the TV, ran to my parents room and they were both very asleep. I even tried to wake them up, my Dad was snoring and my Mom had spit drooling... So I shook my head, went back to the room and ran to look out the window... nothing... I searched the whole house... turned on every light, still, nothing.

But I knew deep down it knew it scared me and it vanished on its own. I felt bad after that. My one, most meaningful, encounter and I got scared instead. Afterwards I would say out loud, ""I am sorry I didn't mean to be scared, please come back"" I never did find out what it was... I felt it held no malice towards me, it wasn't glowing or anything like that, it looked like a hooded figure in the dark with a robe on.

Anyone care to comment? It has bothered me ever since. What do you think?

House of Many Hauntings,"Kentucky, United States",Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: House of Many Hauntings

T here is a house in my home town where I used to live. And where one of my best friends used to live. We have both seen most of the same stuff at the same time, but some things we have seen at different times. When I lived there, I saw some things and when he lived there he saw some things.

The first thing I saw happened one morning, while I was getting ready for school. I was headed down stairs with my sheet because it always stayed cold. I felt like something was behind me, so I turned to look and it was a dog, only I could see through it and it had no head. The second thing that happened to me was I went down to the basement one night, because this is where we had our pool table at the time. I turned on the light for the basement and as I was walking down, I felt something grab my leg from behind the stairs. I freaked and ran down the stairs and the light went out. I made it out the side door, after that, we put the pool table upstairs. Oh yeah and in my parents room there was a little box-like thing, made out of wood. It looked like a storage bow of some sorts but I could never get it open.

Now on to what my friend saw. When my family moved out, my best friend moved in like 5 or 6 years later. I had totally forgot about the things that had happened to me in the house until he started telling me things that had happened to him. He said on certain nights, he can hear and see a red ball bouncing down the stairs and back up the stairs. He also saw a little girl. He said the girl would appear in his room and she would be crying, he guessed because her dolls head had fallen off. But then, he said a man would come wielding a axe and grab the girl and pull her out of the room. Then he throws her down the stairs. He said one night he got up enough courage to follow them. And they made their way to the basement. There, the ghosts disappeared. He said he saw the basement change before his eyes. The floor had become covered with bones and he saw a light shining in the corner. The basement had a little tunnel in it that wrapped around half of the house. He crawled down the tunnel and there was a axe up against the wall. He went to grab it and it was gone.

The next thing that happened to us was when I spent the night there. It was the summer so I was basically always over there. We were watching tapes ECW, which, for those who don't know what that is, is was a wrestling show. Suddenly it got real dark outside, like freaky dark for 4 o'clock in the afternoon. And it started lightning. My buddy said this is what happened the last time before the ghost appeared. He said that lightning had flashed 13 times and then they appeared. I laughed thinking ""yeah right"". Boom the second flash of lightning. I looked out the window and saw a trailer across the street and it looked like someone was staring back at me. But that couldn't be, because the trailers were abandoned.

Then I woke up with a wet towel on my head. And toilet paper on my nose. My buddy had said I started shaking and my nose started bleeding and I passed out. I sit up and asked how many strikes of lighting were we up to. He said 10 and asked what I saw. I tried to explain to him that it was like a man figure but he had red glowing eyes. Bam! Another strike of lightning followed by another. There was one left and we would see if my friends story would hold true. Then the last strike hit. To my surprise, there was no thunder. Then the TV went off. And a cold chill filled the room. I looked around as my eyes were trying to adjust and I saw a figure or a little girl. I quickly closed my eyes and covered my head then I felt something tug the covers I said ""stop it rick, I believe you"". He didn't say anything, I pulled them down and the girl was right in front of my face. I thought I was going to have a heart attack.

We did some research through locals, they said the house was haunted. And we were like ""no shiat"". But one lady who used to live there added that one night, she had locked up and went upstairs to lay down for bed. She had gotten almost to sleep when she heard the front door unlock and open the shut and lock back. Now, in this house, the door has only one door that can be locked from the outside unless the new people that live there have recently changed it, but before they moved in, the only door that could be locked from the outside is a door on the side of the house. She rushed downstairs to find nobody in the house so she went back to bed. Then she heard her dishes being messed with once again. She rushed downstairs to see dishes in the floor and her knifes and forks floating in the air. They stopped and went flying toward her. She got behind a door. She left that night and moved out the next day.

Something really bad and crazy happened in this house. But every time I try and research it, nothing pops up on the web or in any of our local papers from the past. I am thinking somebody covered it up to sell that house.

Mysterious and Unexplainable Things,"New York, United States",Psychic / Medium,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Psychic / Medium :: Mysterious and Unexplainable Things

E ver since a child, I remembered living in an old apartment building in New York, where at night, when all had gone to sleep, I would see walking gray shadows, plasma is what they call it, from my room passing through the door and going to the living room. I was small, thinking it was normal. But I never experienced anything bad happening to me. Just saw these as normal ever since. Strange incidents happened when I started noticing some forces and be aware of things. For example, My Mom had a small brown hair roller, and I would put my finger inside and it would tickle my finger. The plastic threads would move. Every time I put the finger in it, it will really move. But, when I put my finger in another roller, different one, a black one, it would not move, only this particular brown roller. The only brown one she had. I asked her about this particular roller, she told me someone gave it to her.

Once, I was resting on my mother's bed. Something wanted me to move a small indent mark the furniture had on the headboard, and move it to the other side. I touched it and I moved the indented mark to the other side. Mom came in the room and yelled at me, ""Why are your ruining the furniture?"" Then I saw what I did. Couldn't believed it! I tried to do it again, but couldn't.

When the mom, dad and sisters were walking the street, a family was headed front of us. I saw this black dog, it had a leach. What was so interesting about this dog was it had the face of a woman. She was white, red hair, mature. When the family passed by us. I looked at my parent to see if they saw what I was seeing. They did not. I looked at the dog, and it looked back at me. Still, I didn't understand what was this all about. Was it normal? But yet, I was little. Who was the face I saw? I'll tell you later, as strange as it seems. But one thing is sure, one thing as to do with the other.

We moved to another apartment in Coney Island. Months later, strange things happened there. My father was placing a light bulb in the hallway. In these old New York apartments, the doors still had the big old type keyholes, where you can see outside the hallway. While my Dad was placing the bulb, some strange force wanted me to look through this keyhole. I did, I saw an eye, and I knew who it belonged to. I just stood straight, never told Dad about it, because I asked myself, ""Why this lady wanted to peek through this key hold. She lives in the next building?"" Again I will tell you later why.

I was sick and couldn't go to school. Mom had to take my sister's to school. School was right nearby. Mom hurried back quickly, but not quickly enough. I thought Dad was at home, while Mom took my sisters to school. Well, Mom came back, she asked me how was I doing, I told her I was fine and dad was in the small room typing some church speech. She said he was not at home, he had gone with her, and went somewhere else. I said he couldn't be! I heard the typewriter. I went to the small office and he was not there, the typewriter was on the desk.

This time I knew Dad was not at home, and I heard the typewriter. I went over to the door, and felt the vibration of the typewriter and it was not on the desk. I still heard the typewriter and it was inside the room closet! I went over to the closet door and still felt the vibration. I had to find what was happening! I opened the door and it stopped. The typewriter was on the top shelf of the closet. So, I got on a chair, looked at the typewriter and all its key were up! I got down as fast as I could, went to my room and pulled up the covers until Mom came. She came and saw I was scared as hell! I couldn't explain it to her. Days later, when he wanted to use the typewriter, he yelled who was messing with it. He wouldn't believe me if I told him.

We are christians and there was a time I couldn't read or hold a bible, the words kind of jumped, it felt like when one put the positive side to a positive of a magnet together, it does not stick. This was the same effect I had when I touched a bible. But then, this phenomenon stopped.

Mom changed my bedroom to the small office room! Well, the first night, I couldn't sleep, I had asthma, diarrhea, and fever. When Mom took me out of this room, everything was gone. I was feeling fine, I slept with them. The next day, I slept there again, and again the same effect. Every time Mom took me out of the room, I got better. So they decided to change my room where it was before. But this time, they placed my bed where you can see the outside, the main entrance apartment door and had an inch up above level, where you can see the other side of the hallway. Well, one night, when all was sleeping, I heard someone was coming up the steps, waiting for who ever it was, to knock at the door. I saw the shoes shadows, then turned to walk to the other stairs going up to the the last floor, where there are no other apartments. We were the last floor tenants of that building. As soon I heard it going up that stairs, I went running to my parents room and told them someone was going to the roof. Dad opened the door and asked who was up there. No one answered. No one was there.

I fell from the stairs three times. From the third floor, where we lived, to the second floor. I know that every time I fell, I always felt someone pushed me to fall down.

We lived at this apartment for a very long time, as I got older I understood a few things.

The eye that I saw in the hallway belong to the lady I stated above. She used to live in this apartment. She practiced spiritism. She did all the things they do in the small office room I stated above. She was the face I saw on the dog. Once My Mom sent me to the hardware store around the corner. I saw this lady, smiling at me, as if she knew me. It was her. I ran fast inside the store, the lady looked inside the store from the window. I was so scared! The store owner asked me what was wrong? I couldn't talk. The owner went outside to see what terrified me. I told the owner ""all is fine now"". I left fast as soon I saw her went down the block.

There are other incidents and strange ones where I can predict things to come, and do happen. But this does not happen often. I can detect malicious forces in people, and it's not really the person. There are so many thing I understood through time. One thing I am sure. Keep away of things unknown. There are forces wanting to confuse and mold you to things you are not. And there are people who are not really there at all. I mean, there are there, in the flesh, but not in their minds, there are lost. The are looking for host to fill the worldly immoral values we see in life today. Just beware of yourself, and not be fooled and confused.

But this apartment really made me sense something was not normal with me.

Do Fishes Have a Spirit?,Argentina,Pets / Animals,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Pets / Animals :: Do Fishes Have a Spirit?

I 'm struggling with this myself, to decide if it was real or if I imagined it. All I can do is write it down here, as it happened to me, and let you all be the judge.

I left England, UK, to come and live in Argentina after a difficult time in my life. I moved to San Telmo, to get involved in the antiques trade that I love, in Buenos Aires. Now this is a town rife with spiritual activity, although I didn't know that when I moved here! I was aiming for Palermo because a friend lived there, but ended up in San Telmo - long story. Anyway.

When I first got my apartment, I was lonely: I admit it. I would've liked a dog or a cat but the landlord was difficult, and I didn't want to push my luck in my new country. So I got myself two fish, thinking ""the landlord can hardly object to the noise they make!"" and for a few months, we were all happy.

Then, sadly, I found one morning that both fish had died in the night. I don't know if they'd fought, or there was something in the water, but dead they were, both wedged in the bubble-generating treasure chest that they'd loved while they were still with us. I buried them in the little park outside the Recoleta cemetery, and got used to the idea that they were gone. But I missed them, and after a few weeks had passed, I decided to get new fishes. I couldn't see a reason to replace the tank, or the plants, or the treasure chest since it was clearly popular.

But here's the strange part: it doesn't matter what I do, the new fish won't go ANYWHERE NEAR the treasure chest. I even tried putting their food inside, but they wouldn't touch it! In the end I got a new tank, and they're happy in there. But what was it about the old treasure chest that made them fear it? Perhaps I'll never know.

Thanks for letting me share that. It's hard, far from home and estranged from your mother, to deal with these things and sometimes you just think you're imagining it. It's good to know other people share these experiences, and you're not alone with them.

F rom August 2005 to late Spring 2006, I lived in an spacious old flat in Madison with 3 friends. One day I was home alone putting dishes away in the kitchen when I heard the loud sigh of a woman behind me. I hadn't heard anyone come in, but I wasn't startled because it sounded exactly like my housemate's girlfriend Joelle (whom I've known for years), and it was common for her to be there during the day. But when I turned around, she wasn't there. I checked the rest of the house but I was alone and the front door locked.

On another weekend, I was out of town with my fiancee visiting her family. All the rest of my housemates spent the weekend out of town as well (in fact one of them was out of state) except Tom, who stayed there with his girlfriend (the same previously mentioned Joelle). When I returned late Sunday night, Tom asked me where I had been all day, and I explained that I'd been out of town since Friday afternoon. Tom seemed a little alarmed by that, saying ""We both saw you walk from your room to the kitchen and back at night yesterday while we were watching TV. It was dark, but we were sure it was you..."" We were both a bit creeped out by the thought.

When I was alone in the computer room or my bedroom, I would frequently hear heavy footsteps creaking on the wood floor in the dining room. Eric Jon (one of the housemates) wore heavy, hard-soled boots indoors all the time, so I usually assumed it was just him until I went to welcome him home and discovered the flat was empty and I was alone. All three of the other housemates agreed that they had experienced this same phenomenon, and often.

Most of the things that happened there mimicked the actions of the flat's occupants. I wonder if the house just ""remembered"" the things that happened in it and replayed them.

Home Alone,Armenia,Misc,"W hen I was 10, I spent the night at my grandma, Crystals. She went to pick up my sister up and I was getting in the shower when I realized that I hadn't gotten my clothes set out. So I went back to my room and my radio was turned off, I knew that I had kept it on, so I turned it back on and went to the bathroom. I heard a noise, I went to my room and my radio was turned off again and my TV was now on, so I thought something was wrong with the electricity. I was in the shower washing my hair when I heard the door open so I yelled ""grandma is that you?"" and I didn't hear anything so I ignored it. I was putting conditioner on my hair when the shower curtain moved, then, before I knew it, the whole shower curtain flew open and I was being pushed down. My grandma was obese so she had a pointy thing that she held on to so she wouldn't fall and hurt herself, when I got pushed down my leg hit that and blood went everywhere. I had to get stitches and I still have the scar today!

That Wasn't Me,Ireland,Misc,"T his happened to my mom. My mom (her name is Penny) was downstairs chopping lettuce or something, getting ready for dinner. She noticed how cold it was getting in the house, and asked me to turn on the fire. The fire flickered on and she said her thanks. My mom continued getting dinner ready when she saw someone walk past the doorway to the kitchen. She called my name.

I was upstairs, the entire time, watching a movie with my friend. When she called my name, I walked to the stair ledge and asked what it was. She had a surprised expression on her face and said that I was downstairs.

I said no, that I was upstairs the entire time. This gave us both the chills, because it wasn't me who had turned on the fire either.

Also, though this sounds strange, we have seen ghost ships or old colonial ships sail by our house at night sometimes. My mom doesn't believe in ghosts, but she still gets freaked out.

After this, many strange things have happened. We have noticed dead animals around our house too. Well, give me your comments.

My Grandpa Sees Spirits,"Wisconsin, United States",Psychic / Medium,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Psychic / Medium :: My Grandpa Sees Spirits

I have a couple short stories. My Grandfather tends to see spirits a lot. Him and my nana (nana is italian for Grandmother) live an a house that was built in the 60's. They are the only people to ever live in that house. It had just been built shortly before they moved in. Apparently, there is a guy in a cowboy hat who stands in the back of the hallway. He doesn't do or say anything, he just stands there. My Grandpa, my uncle, and a few of my uncle's friends have all seen him. My nana, my dad, or I have never seen him. Though, when I was younger, I was always afraid to walk down that hallway. I'm not sure why, but for some reason it scared me. My Grandparents still live there... Although I haven't been to their house in years. The next time I go there, I hope to be able to see him. I didn't know this story until this past Christmas, so maybe if I try to look for him, I might see him? I'm not sure if it will work, but its worth a shot.

Here is another story about a spirit my Grandpa saw; When my Grandpa was around 15 or 16 years old, he saw his next door neighbor walking down the street. He wanted to get her attention, so he kept calling her name, ""Phyllis? Phyllis? Phylliss? Turn around! Phyllis?"" he continued doing that for a while and then started walking up to her to try and get her attention. He couldn't get her to turn around, so he gave up and left. He went to Phyllis's house when her mom answered heartbroken. My Grandpa said, ""I just saw Phyllis walking down the street, but no matter what I did, she wouldn't turn around..."" Her Mom answered, ""Phyllis died about 2 hours ago..."" My Grandpa thinks he saw her spirit crossing over. It was definitely her because he knew her for years, and saw her face before he started yelling at her to turn around.

Ghost Figures,Australia,Apparitions / Voices / Touches,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Apparitions / Voices / Touches :: Ghost Figures

T he first encounter was when I was around 10 years old and I was sleeping. I suddenly woke up and it was midnight. I felt really hot at the time so I just took a glance around the room. That's when I saw a hooded figure on top of my bed. I was terrified so I just peeked through the blanket so I woudln't get noticed. I also felt its heavy weight like someone else was sleeping on my bed. I was living in a flat at that time and there was another bed in the room, I looked at the other bed and I noticed I had seen a ghost figure but it was glowing real bright blue and it was sleeping on it in a sideways position. I decided to move very slow in the left position so I can ignore and forget about the situation and I did a little praying so it can go away. I then fell asleep.

The next morning I woke up all sweaty and exhausted. It must of been from being too scared or something and I didn't tell anyone about it until later.

My next encounter happened in the morning around 8-9 am, this time I was living in a house and I was around 13 years old. I woke up around 7:30 am and decided to sleep in the lounge since the weather was hot and the room's temperature increased. When I was about to close my eyes I saw a real tall figure, kind of like the exact same one I saw in the first encounter, but I could nearly clearly see it.

I was pretending to sleep because I was too scared to even look at it, so I kind of peeked and then I turned my head. That's when I had enough and decided to see what it wanted so I looked back and it disappeared. I told my parents what happened they said I was dreaming or something. I have had a few ghost encounter, mostly when I was younger and I heard the house I was living in at the time was haunted. Well it seemed like it to me since I was the only one seeing it.

I'm 19 now so everything is fine, I outgrew it or just ignored the ghosts so they left me.

I Couldn't Move,"California, United States",Apparitions / Voices / Touches,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Apparitions / Voices / Touches :: I Couldn't Move

I know other people have experienced what I have. So I'll just share my story. I grew up in this old house in Lynwood, CA. It was pretty creepy at times especially if you were alone. My mom was a good christian women so she always told me if I ever felt something meaning like an ""evil spirit"", just rebuke it in the name of Jesus.

I must have been about 15 years old. I am now 27. I had woken up in the middle of the night and I couldn't go back to sleep. So I just kind of stared into the darkness. But then I just closed my eye's for a moment and I started to lose feeling from my feet to the top of my body. I was ""awake"" and I was scared to open my eyes. I could not move. So I just started to pray... As soon as I started to do that the feeling slowly went away. It was so weird, but I have experienced this many times. My sister swears that someone in that same room I was sleeping in pulled her blankets off of her.

Also, one time, I was home alone, it must have been around 11:00 a.m., because my mom was at work and I was home. It happened during the summer vacation. I woke up and saw two people standing at my door way, it looked like to boys one maybe in his mid teens and the other around ten. They were just looking at me. And when I blinked my eyes to see if they were still there, they were gone, of course. So I got up got dressed and called my mom to pick me up. I looked all around the house to see if any doors were unlocked any windows were opened but everything was locked up.

Ghostly Encounters,"Kentucky, United States",Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: Ghostly Encounters

M y stories take place in my apartment. It's small, one bedroom, and is basically a big square divided into four rooms. There are a set of stairs that lead up to my living room, seven to be exact. When I first moved in, I always had a strange feeling about the place, but being out on my own for the first time I figured it to be stress and nervousness about renting my first apartment. Although I have always had this sixth sense, if you will, about ghosts and when they are around, I decided it wasn't anything paranormal. Unfortunately I was wrong.

My first experience was pretty surprising. I was sitting in my bedroom in my rocking chair when I heard my screen door and front door opened. For fear someone was coming in my house, I stepped out and looked towards the steps. I heard someone, or something, walk up my steps, down my hall towards my bedroom, just a few feet in front of me. Then they turned around and walked back down the hall and down the steps with a menacing laugh. Then ""it"" went back out the door.

My second experience was a lot more violent. I was standing at the top of my stairs looking out my open front door. All of a sudden I felt this chill go over my whole body. I felt my legs/feet being pushed from behind and down the stairs I went. As soon as I hit the bottom this evil voice boomed from the top of the stairs and said ""GET UP, GET UP NOW!"" I was terrified and in lots of pain. I ended up going to the hospital for some bruised ribs and a very minor concussion. Since then a couple of minor things have happened, stuff being moved, voices saying stuff, but nothing like the first two. Who knows when the next big one will happen.

I Can See You,United Kingdom,Apparitions / Voices / Touches,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Apparitions / Voices / Touches :: I Can See You

I have never believed in ghosts. I've always been skeptical. I've read about sleep paralysis causing all sorts of weird things, and think that some people make things up. My story isn't flashy, it doesn't involve moving objects or ghostly figures. But something happened to me the other night that has made me believe.

I'm an intelligent person, and I know what I experienced was unlike anything I've ever heard before. It cannot be explained by any external factor, or by any sleep paralysis because I wasn't asleep. Could it be my mind? Possibly. But I would have thought I'd have had something like this before should that be the case.

At 1:00 am, I finished working on my computer. I went to bed switching the lights off on the way. 30 seconds after getting into bed and closing my eyes, I started hearing some strange noises. I was hearing whooshing, roaring and clattering noises. Then out of nowhere, I heard someone whisper in a malicious sort of tone something like ""I can see you"" or ""I know you're there"" followed by an almighty whoosh in my right ear that was really intensely loud I almost felt it. I was freaked out and did not want to open my eyes. So without further ado, I quickly prayed and prayed earnestly to God in the name of Jesus Christ and the experience soon died off. I was safe again.

A few days later, I related this story to my sister who, two weeks ago (in a different house), said she heard someone whisper to her ""What are you doing"", but no one said a thing.

Just today, my niece has told her that she has heard childish laughter and even saw a gray shadow of what she described was a man in one of the rooms.

I am convinced now that there are ghosts. That being the case, there is an afterlife, and there is a God.

My Haunted Home,"New York, United States",Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: My Haunted Home

M y house is probably haunted. I have a LOT of stories for it! It's only around 50-55 years old, but we have some old furniture in my room (which is what we presume haunted) that belonged to my great-grandma. Only a few months ago, my friend slept over and, around 1:30am, I had fallen asleep. She couldn't fall asleep, so she decided to read. When she did, she heard someone running down the hallway and into the bathroom, then slamming the door. She got up to see who it was, thinking it was probably my brother or sister. She knocked on the door and there was no answer, and then, when she opened it, no one was in there... I know this is true, because she is my best friend and it's not like her to lie like this. Plus, I've had a few more experiences myself...

One day, I was home alone. My mom had gone out to pick up my brother and sister from school. I was on the computer, and all of a sudden, I heard someone running around upstairs. I was really freaked out, because my dog was locked in her crate in the kitchen, and the cat was outside. Besides, she's too small to make a noise like that.

Another time, I was in my room alone and the TV was on, but I was sitting in front of the TV doing my homework. All of a sudden, the TV turned off! I thought maybe at first it was broken, but it was brand new and we hadn't kicked it or anything like that.

Finally, one more time, I was in my room upstairs, and it felt like someone was sitting on the end of the bed. I sat up, thinking it was my dog or something, and no one was there. I turned on the light and no one was in the room, hiding or anything.

So those are my stories. I'm sure I have more, just can't remember them. I'm not making them up, but I'm sure there's some skeptic out there who can explain. I certainly hope not, because there's nothing like a good ghost story!

Blue Man,"Minnesota, United States",Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: Blue Man

W hen me and my family moved into a brand new house about 10 years ago, my mother would hear me talking to someone in my room. Supposedly I was talking to a man in a blue shirt. I was three and I couldn't make out anything else out. A few years later my mother was mowing the lawn and briefly looked into my window and saw a man in a blue shirt standing in my window.

Then my step dad moved in and claimed that he woke up in his room with a blue man at the end of the bed. A few nights later my mom was sleeping in her room and woke up to loud noises. When she opened her eyes she saw blue man in the corner of the room by the door way. On another occasion I woke up to a face right in front of mine and then just disappear while turning away.

Now my sister was in her bedroom in the basement and she was on the computer and in the reflection of the other side of the room she saw a figure a man. The next week I was in her bathroom cleaning and I saw this bright blue light and then a face appeared in the light. I have always believed in ghosts and so does everyone in my house or people that have stayed in my house.

Am I crazy? Is everyone in my house crazy I don't know, you tell me!

Unfortunate Stay at Grandma's,Bahamas,Apparitions / Voices / Touches,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Apparitions / Voices / Touches :: Unfortunate Stay at Grandma's

W hen I was 15, my best friend took me with her to visit her grandma. She didn't want to go alone but she wouldn't tell me why. That night, when we were in bed, I was listening to the sound of silence, when I heard someone calling my name. I was completely scared because none of her family knew my name. I got up from the bed and crossed the room and opened the closet door (that's where I heard the noise coming from) but there was nothing inside. Slightly shaken, I sat on the edge of the bed, wondering what I was going to do now.

I opened the window to let some air in and that's when I saw, standing on the lawn, the vivid image of a young girl (no more than 6) covered in blood, saying ""Trysh, help me"". Needless to say, I shut the window rather quickly and went back to wake my friend up. Before I could tell her what happened, she asked me if I saw 'her', to which I replied 'yes'. Apparently, every time she stayed with her grandmother she would wake up hearing her name and every time there was that same little girl asking for help...

Ghosts and Channeling,"New Jersey, United States",Psychic / Medium,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Psychic / Medium :: Ghosts and Channeling

S ometime near the end of September of this year 2006 I went to my friends home in NJ. My friend ""Mike's"" house has claimed to have been haunted from him and his family ever since I knew him. When I was younger (about 10 or 12 years ago) my friend and I went into his dark and cluttered basement and were looking around at all the cool antiques and items. We saw some clothes move around near the washer and dryer; so my friend Mike thought it was his brother and picked up a plastic bat to scare him with or hit him with. When we went over there the clothes stopped moving and nobody was there. We freaked out and ran back to the stairs to go back up, but a large painting which was facing backwards towards us blocked our way up the stairs. Together we moved it away and ran scared as hell back up. We told his mom and she believed it was the ghosts or ghosts in the house. After that I never went in his basement or really visited his house.

So as time went by I later became good friends with Mike again and ended back up at his house a lot. Nothing weird happened until the events of the September that just passed.

Mike and my close friend Val were sitting up stairs in Mike's room just relaxing and talking. His room was very soothing because he had a very large fish tank and he had a visualizer on his tv playing mellow music. Not sure if this had anything to do with it, but I was very relaxed and I was staring into the visualizer on the television. Mike was talking about ghosts with us and actually brought up the time when we were younger when we saw something in the basement. He told me about the painting that blocked our way back up the stairs... And I didn't remember it. I suppose I blocked that part out.

The a little while later still upstairs in his bedroom I start feeling weird. I felt like the room was getting darker and I couldn't feel myself correctly. I felt as if I was falling slightly backwards. The best I could describe it would be getting a shiver up my spine and feeling that moment right before you pass out, or when you are on medicine and sick; you feel very spacey. That's how I felt. So I quickly panicked and told Mike and Val that something was wrong. I told them I didn't feel right. I felt like I couldn't keep my mind focused. I was thinking that maybe I was dying for some weird reason and I really didn't want to. My friends told me to calm down and were looking at me weird. I kept telling them I didn't feel right and my friend said to come down because I was working myself up and my heart was racing. He didn't want me to get a panic attack. He then told me to close my eyes and I did. Then I saw visions and felt emotions of things. I got freaked out, but was also curious at what the hell was going on. I told my friend Mike and he thought I was channeling. I told him no I wasn't... I couldn't be. He kept saying I was. Apparently he was right.

I was a little boy sitting on a wooden dock with wooden walls around me. My feet were dangling out the door and there was a fence like door that was open outward and it had a little black book with a latch on it. It was dangerous to get the book because I could have fallen out, but I wanted it for some reason. Out the door was a lake and it was very calm and nice out. The green stalks and trees seemed very clean to me.

At this point I started crying. I personally was not crying, but my body was. My fingers turned freezing cold and when I came out of it they warmed up. I later found out that every time this happens my body cries as a signal to tell me yes this is true, or yes this is happening. Everything important is relayed back to me through emotional responses, either happy or crying, even though the feeling I am receiving is not always a sad one.

So then I picked up a piece of paper and with my eyes closed I drew a picture. I drew what I was seeing and the little boy. I felt the time period was in the early 1900's and this boy had a schoolboy uniform on with a hat with a dark ribbon hanging to the side. I said my name was Josh or James and continued to draw on another piece of paper. I drew on 3 different papers and then just folded them up and placed them together to make one whole picture. It was uncanny how everything lined up. Some pieces of the drawing were hard to see, but others were very clear. I began to get freaked out again.

As the pen moved on the paper, I felt as if there were magnetic forces pulling my hand at little increments to make the image on the paper. At one point I put the pen on the side of my palm with my hand straight out and it started spinning in one spot very slowly. Again I was freaked out. I wasn't able to understand the whole message that night, possibly because it was my first time, I'm not sure. The little boy also got very frustrated very easily when my friend Mike talked to him.

A day passed and we all thought about everything that happened all day. I went back to the house and again went back into Mike's room. This time another friend, ""Wes"" was there. We were hanging out again and just watching a movie this time. I again started to feel something. I was also trying to tap into whatever I was doing again though. This time I felt like my right side of my face was drooping or had something wrong with it. I looked at my friend Val to the right of me and asked her if anything was wrong with my face. Then Val told me my eyes turned a different color and I said ""When I look at you I just..."" I didn't remember saying that. Val was questioning me about what I was saying. Then I started to feel that falling backwards feeling and I started to cry. My fingers became freezing again and I closed my eyes and could hear myself breathing. Everything after this felt more like a dream then truth. Luckily my friends were there to remember it all and I remember telling them to remember because I may not. I think this day I felt like whatever was embodying me had more control then the previous day. I said I felt cold and I saw water. It was nighttime and I kept saying the water was like Titanic cold water. There was a lighthouse also. Val asked if it was her grandfather and I cried and felt that it was. She began to cry a little as well. She said her grandfather saved two young girls in frigid waters and he got a medal from the town for doing so. I don't know why that message was relayed as telling her that's who it was, but maybe that was the way she would know.

So I kept hugging her and I said that I loved her and missed her. At this point I felt less of myself and began talking to 3rd person. I was saying that Kevin was ok. I was letting everyone know that I was personally ok, but my body was crying and something else was talking through it. Everyone there believed everything that was happening as well. So after a little bit, my friend Mike whose room it was, asked if I wanted to get some air. I agreed. We went downstairs and Val was making sure I felt ok. Mike wanted to get a glass of water from the kitchen before we went out and asked if it was ok. I agreed. I didn't want to be alone, so we all walked to the kitchen.

The kitchen had a door which went into the basement. To get to the kitchen we walked through the dinning room and passed the bathroom and his mother's room. His mother's room was originally his step-dads father's room. Mike's step-grandfather was bed ridden and died in that room. I know he is one of the ghosts in the house.

So when we walked past the dinning room and bedroom I felt enormous energies around me. I jumped into the kitchen and told Mike. We were there for a little bit and then walked out again. I felt the energies again and started to move my hands like an Italian would when they are pointing at something. Shaking both hands up and down. I did that in the living room where a pile of clothes were, the dinning room, were some more clothes were, and back in the kitchen were the garbage was. My friend Wes said, ""What do they want you to clean up the house or something."" I laughed and felt happy. I believe that is what the energy wanted, as funny as it sounds.

So then Mike cleans up and we start to go outside, but get stopped again. I fell on my knee and Mike said I mumbled something, but sounded weird. I was getting up and I said ""the spot,"" pointing down at the spot on the ground. Every time I mention this ""spot"" I also get choked up and feel whatever it is is very powerful. I don't know what it is though. So I kept talking about this spot and then I heard something whisper ""Mike"" from the bedroom area. I quickly turned right at Mike and said, ""Did you hear that?"" He said yea and I said it said your name. He started to cry and get worked up, because now we knew this was really happening. There's no way we both could've heard the same thing and me say exactly what it was if it didn't happen. Nobody else heard the voice though surprisingly. I was scared and I went over to Mike with my heart racing. He was getting a little distraught and called up his cousin and husband. They were very interested in paranormal activities and raced over. I guess that's why Mike called them.

So then I kept pointing at the spot, and feeling the magnetic forces around me. I can't remember the whole scene after this, but I know Mike asked if I wanted to go into the mother's room, where the grandfather died. I said ok. He opened the door and Me and my friend Wes began to go near the door. As soon as we did we both jumped back and felt something. I said there was a huge energy there and it just freaked me out. We ended up going in the room and my hand was moving around on the dresser searching or trying to tell us something, but I never got what it was. Then Val's grandfather came back in me and I turned to her and hugged her starting to cry again.

We went out and I went back to the spot talking about it. I didn't know what was so important about it. I followed my hand into a grandfather clock that was near the spot and opened it and a little piece of ripped paper fell out. It said something from dad or something. I'm not entirely sure if this was important or just coincidental. Then I went over to an old desk which was right near the same area and tried to get something that was under the lid of the top of it. I also never found anything there or figured out what was there. Then Mike asked if I would go into the basement. I said no man... I do not want to go there. He said what if the spot was something in the basement and it could start a fire or something. He wanted to know because it was his house. I agreed to go, not really wanting to go. I was very jumpy and my body was worn out at this point.

We had the 2 girls jump on the spot upstairs so we could find it exactly in the basement and me and the 3 other guys went in the basement. We went all the way to the back with flashlights, because the lights were so dim it didn't matter if they were even on. Mike said the room which we were going to enter was the grandfathers tool room. I really didn't want to go in, but I did. We entered the small closet like room. I went in and there were a lot of old rusted tools on the wall. To the left and right were pitch black dark areas. I was a little scared. Normally I would have not gone in there but I felt like it was ok. Then I felt like I couldn't breathe. I panicked and began to calm down and breathe very slowly as I made noise breathing in and out. Mike said it sounded like I was dying. He said I may have been the grandfather when he was on his deathbed breathing slowly. I pointed up at some wood and fishing poles attached to a wooden rack above us. I was pointing at a wire or something, that was right under the spot I was talking about. Mike asked what it was.

Then I heard a voice creep up from the darkness behind me and it said with a slight bit of attitude that it was a phone wire. It scared the hell out of me. I didn't know this but, Mike said my eyes looked weird and he said it looked like I was going to kill him so he was frightened and then I let out a scream and dashed passed everyone back to the stairs going back up. I looked back and everyone was getting up off the ground. I went back to get them and we all ran upstairs.

We went up stairs and went over what happened and calmed down. We then finally went outside on the porch and talked some more. Val's grandfather came in me again for a little bit and then left again. I felt a warmth and saw my grandmother and grandfather who were deceased to the left of me. I didn't tell anyone until a day later though. I didn't physically see them with my eyes, but I knew they were there and I could feel them and see them in my mind. That's the best I could describe it.

Next I went to the A&P (a large 24hour food store) because I knew it was very bright there and that's where I wanted to be. I felt more myself in the light. In the darkness I could feel things around me. So I stayed there for a few hours with my friend Val and then finally went home with her and she slept over because I was still really scared of everything.

As I walked up my stairs and past my parents room, I felt like my grandmother was in the room with my mother and she was having a dream about her. The next day I told my mom the story and she believed me because she had events happen in her life when she was younger herself. Then I told her I saw grandma and she was set back and started to cry. It was her mother and she was close to her. I said I knew she dreamt about her last night because I could feel it and I just knew. She was a little freaked out but believed me and told me that it was true.

If you have any information for me, please let me know. This is all new to me and I have been reading up on it and trying to figure it out the best I can, but I still would love for some help. I believe you may know some things that could help. Hopefully I'm doing everything right. But I don't know how to focus better to get a clearer message yet. You are welcome to talk or visit if you feel it would further help you understand the goals you are looking to achieve. I wish you luck and hope you write back.

The Spoon Collection,"Texas, United States",Family / Friends Visits,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Family / Friends Visits :: The Spoon Collection

H ave you been contacted by someone who crossed, someone on the other side? I have and I believe all of us have. Some simply recognize the contact, some choose to rationalize the contact and some do not even notice the contact. Read my story; it is not easy to rationalize it or ignore it! Indeed, for me, it is impossible to do so.

On January 4, 2003, my husband and I were returning from a couple of days of play; it was late and dark and we were talking non-stop as we always did-even when there was nothing to say-as we drove toward home. The subject of crossing over and death came up; I had lost five relatives in the preceding thirteen months and we talked about where they might be. What they might be? How they might be? Death conversations were never macabre with us; they always seemed natural and open and inquisitive. This night's exchange of ideas seemed a little more serious, but not 'scary' serious, just 'interestingly' serious. Ron and I had been married forty years, less about three weeks and, at some point in the discussion, we made a pact: ""The one of us who found ourselves first on the other side would attempt to contact the one left behind,"" a small concrete sign that life does indeed go on.

That brief exchange of ideas and promises between two healthy adults with plans to live many, many more years re-surfaced within a fortnight and with surprising clarity. Hear my story.

We traveled a lot and wherever we went, we collected spoons. Over the last several years, we took thirty to ninety day trips and, for our last year together we rolled along in an Alfa Gold Fifth Wheel. We worked as camp hosts, birded, hiked, built trails, went sightseeing, hit the casinos and collected spoons. Ronnie died nine days before we were to leave on a thirty day trip to Australia and New Zealand to celebrate our fortieth anniversary. Anticipating the spoons we would collect had made the planning of it more intriguing. Our collection of spoons began in 1974 in Denver, Colorado, the first of many vacations we would share with Bets, my mother in law. She bought a spoon rack for me to display spoons commemorating the sites we saw. Spoons from every ghost town, National Monument, National Park, restored fort, every place we visited graced that first rack and I guess the collecting of spoons transfused our blood, Ronnie's more than mine. Over the years, he selected and purchased eight more spoon racks with capacities varying from twelve to forty-eight and displayed them on our living room walls. Everywhere we went, we searched for the perfect spoon to perpetuate that specific spot in our minds.

The one rule was: Never display any spoon unless we had visited the place, a rule set aside when Jessie, our grand daughter, brought us three from her European trip. Still, those spoons hung separately on a row segregated from the ones saluting our incredible times together.

During the summer of 2002, Ron and I talked a lot about our spoons as we wandered from place to place across the Midwest from Mall of the Americas to Glacier National Park and, at every stop, we bought another one, twenty-one in all-the most we had ever collected in one year. We relived in our conversations those times past already memorialized by spoons on the racks at home. We returned home in November to place our new spoons on those racks and visualized the ones to come 'next year'. Reservations were made at two Australia National Parks, there would be spoons from there; the casino in Melbourne where we would spend our anniversary night would offer a special spoon; Jessie told the innkeeper at the Tasmania bed and breakfast of our hobby and he promised to have one ready; and she even convinced the horse ranch where she worked to have something to add to our collection.

About five thirty in the afternoon of January 6, 2003, Ron and I walked our dog. We'd had a busy day, me packing for Australia and Ron running errands for the office. Ron was more tired than usual, yet we both laughed when he said, ""Those girls at the office don't know I'm retired, or they just don't care!"" About half way into our mile and a half loop walk, he became lightheaded and sat down to rest a minute. I told him I would drive over to pick him up after I finished the walk and Niki and I continued down the trail. From about two hundred fifty yards, I saw he had crossed the creek and was walking toward the locked car. ""Why?"" I thought. ""I had the keys. Why didn't he wait for me?"" When I looked over again, he was lying on the ground. I raced toward him, thinking he must have tripped or perhaps he was dizzy, lost his balance and may have hurt a knee, an ankle. A couple reached him first. He was lucid, not in any pain-I asked him and he said ""no-just very weak and lightheaded..."" I backed the car and the couple helped him in; he thanked them and was dead less than a full minute later. He never struggled, gasped for breath or expressed any indication of pain. He simply stopped breathing. He was pronounced dead on arrival at the hospital; based on what happened, doctors speculated electrical imbalance, cardiovascular disease, a stroke, and, in the end, the death certificate listed 'heart attack'. No one asked to perform an autopsy; didn't seem necessary. Certainly it did not to me. He was gone and the 'why or how' didn't matter. I signed to donate his organs as we had agreed long ago and knew he would be pleased to know someone would see with his corneas, maybe the only usable donation.

I was lost in a fog of disbelief, as were our kids, grand kids and all of the people who loved him. Ronnie and I enjoyed the 'being together' of being married and I could not get my mind around the thought of not having Ronnie next to me. Once, just a few months before, in Deadwood, South Dakota, Ron and I became separated in one of the casinos. Thinking I had left the building, he went down the street and, when I realized he was gone, I panicked, consumed by an unreasonable fear of losing him. As I dashed from building to building in search of him, he searched for me. When we saw either other, I burst into tears and, though I felt foolish, I couldn't stop the tears of relief; he understood and held me for a minute. Maybe that was a precursor of things to come. The same horror and terror multiplied a thousand, a million times devoured my spirit that Monday afternoon and grew to a massive hole in my heart five days later, Saturday morning, the day of the memorial service.

Our kids, my brother, John, who was to do the eulogy, my niece, Peggy, my sister-in-law, Becky, and a couple of friends, arrived early that morning for coffee and to prepare for our formal goodbyes. While the others sat in the living room, John and I sat at the kitchen table talking, reminiscing about how Ronnie had added so much to both of our lives; John made notes as he put together his farewell tribute. The sound of something hitting the floor in the living room pierced the heavy air that surrounded us.

In the twenty-five plus years those racks hung on that wall, never had a spoon fallen. Most of them could only be removed when turned at certain angle. Peg called out, ""Aunt Olevia, a spoon fell..."" Chill bumps covered my arms as I reached to pick up the fallen spoon-from Tombstone, Arizona, a place we had visited so long ago. Without a voice, Ronnie spoke to me and I heard him as clearly as if he sat across the room. ""Ann, I've crossed; the tombstone of my life has been set. You will go on and we will still travel together..."" Becky said, ""Look. The spoon next the one that fell is moving..."" Indeed it was swinging back and forth and I got a chair to climb up to look-Australia? How could that be? We were never in Australia. Australia was just a place we planned to visit together.

I don't know the source of that Australia spoon and it doesn't matter how it found a place in our spoon collection. Ronnie spoke to me-to us-that morning. He let me know I was not alone, that he would stand beside me even as I stood at his tombstone and that he would continue to travel with me. I experienced a peace unknown that week and that peace remains with me. It got me through that day and every day since. There have been dozens of other reminders of Ronnie's continued presence in my life, but none clearer or more opportune than the falling of the spoon.

Ghost that Looked Like Me,India,Misc,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Misc :: Ghost that Looked Like Me

I would like to tell you guys a small story that happened years ago in Mumbai. I was about 9 years old at that time. During the summer vacation my uncle used to take me and my other siblings to a nearby park to play. Every evening we went to the park, played on the swings, the slide and the jungle gym. I was very naughty and many times jumped off the top of the slide to show off to my younger siblings. One day I was very sick and could not go to the park so my uncle just went with my younger sisters. My youngest sister was about 4 at that time. Well, they were back early that day and my youngest sister had bruises on her hands and legs, she was taken to the doctor who said she was ok and had to rest a bit. When we asked her how she got hurt, she told everybody that she was just following me, she said she saw me jump off the slide and thought if I can do it, she can do it too, it was very weird and we did not know what to make of it. She kept insisting that she was following me, I was very wearing a pretty white dress. Mum thought that she must be imagining things cause I was home all the time watching TV and I did not have any white dress. She was not very badly hurt cause she fell on a man who was exercising next to the slide.

Bloody Murder,United Kingdom,Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: Bloody Murder

W hen I was in the pub, I was having a drink with a few mates, it was warm in far corner of the room. I was laughing and chatting away when I felt a hand over my shoulder and whisper something in my ear, it went very cold, I couldn't make out what the voice was saying but it sounded as if I was being told to do do something, The voices stopped. About ten minutes later I felt my hair being torn off, it wasn't but it was very saw. I heard lots of faint screaming and shouting and pleading for mercy or that's what it sounded like anyway, it suddenly it all stopped and went warm again. I was very shaken and told my friends that I was going home. The next day I got on the net and researched that the pub had been the owner of a family that had been murdered in the same room in 1523 and the wife had been dragged from where I had been sitting and stabbed to death just half a meter away from me and 180 years later been dug up when the pub was being refurbished.

I still go to the pub but I don't sit in the same spot as I did that night it just sends a shiver down my spine!

Ava,"Kentucky, United States",Poltergeists / Physical Manifestations,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Poltergeists / Physical Manifestations :: Ava

I had stayed at my mama and papas a lot of times but now, me and my dad are temporarily living there until we can get on our feet. Lately I have been having very strange and discomforting experiences. One night, I had put some polish on the tips of my nails and in the morning I woke up to find the name Ava carved into the polish on my nail. Another time I was waiting in the living room and I was the only one awake and all of the sudden, it sounded like thunder was rolling down the hallway and the chair started rocking for no reason, but no one else heard the loud noise (I am the only one on my dads side of the family who believes in ghosts so I can't tell them any of this, but I can tell my mom). Another time I went to go out of the living room (once again I was the only one up) and I saw Ava for the first time, I saw her full body and she was wearing an orange gown trimmed with white lace. And all of the time I walk through the house and turn around, this shadow-like mist will be following me, but when I do turn around it disappears. Another time (and one of the scariest) I was once again the only one up, in the kitchen, and I heard my name said like in a weird way like kaaayyylllaaaaaaa come from the other end of the house. It sounded like a woman but no one that lives in that house.

Here recently me and my dad were the only one at the house and he was in his room on the other side of the house and I was in the living room. Out of the corner of my eye I kept seeing someone look straight at me, like right next to my face,e and when I would turn that way it would be gone. I got up to make sure it wasn't my dad just playing a trick on me and no one was there. She kept getting right next to my face, looking at me.

The other day I was laying in my room taking pictures of my self with my digital camera and in one of them I had been laying down and right next to me is a ghost and there is nothing that could have made it do this blur. When I got to looking all of my pictures had a smudge on them. And now I have been feeling a lot of cold spots in the house.

I don't think she is there to hurt me but I still get scared especially when it feels like someone is watching me... all the time.

The Little Angels Called Susan and Jack,"Texas, United States",Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: The Little Angels Called Susan and Jack

A long time ago, when me and my sister were young, we went to visit my aunt. It was going to be her birthday so our parents made her a surprise party. My sister and I were so bored and we wanted to walk around her street to get some fresh air. I remember it was really dark and cold and nobody really lived by there. As we were walking, we stopped to hear the voices of children. I was 14 at the time and my sister was 8 but the weird thing is when we looked, nobody was there. So we just kept on walking but I had tripped on something and fell. We looked down and we saw a railroad track. It was so scary because it wasn't there a minute ago. My sister was so scared she started to cry, but I told her it was ok and we would go home. But it wasn't ok, I was lost and I didn't want to tell her and make her cry more.

As we were standing there, a little girl and a little boy popped up out of nowhere, they looked pale and scary as if they were dead. I asked them their names and they said Sarah and Jack. I asked them if they knew how to get to a road that would lead us home. And they both helped us. They walked us to the street and as soon as I saw my aunt's house, I was so happy. I asked them if they wanted to come in and they just stood there. I ran inside to tell my parents.

They just looked at us if we were crazy and I pulled my mom to the door to show her the kids that had helped us but they were gone. We looked for them but it was as if they vanished without a trace. My aunt freaked out when we told her their names and she told us a story I would never forget. She said ""A long time ago there was an accident, a bus had broke down on top of railroad tracks, they tried to get out but the door wouldn't open and all of a sudden a train was coming. They were trapped, all 17 of them, including the driver. And they all died in a crash and ever since, people say they see them and when you park your car on top of the railroad tracks, they push your car out of the way, in case of a train comes. They can save you and they even have streets named after them.""

But I couldn't believe it, I looked at my aunt and my sister and I stayed quiet all night. The next morning we were ready to go we said bye to my aunt and got in the car and as we left, I saw the names Susan and Jack on street signs and ever since that day I have called them ""Angels"".

Strange Things at the American Legion Building,"Michigan, United States",Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: Strange Things at the American Legion Building

M y dad used to work at the American Legion at night, cleaning the building, he was the only one working, so sometimes I would go with him. One night, me and my friend (Ashley) went with him, and we were playing around in ""the blue room"". There was a bar and a lot of tables and things like that, I was standing by the liquor room, and just messing around, tapped on the door, then all of a sudden some one tapped back, and with a different pattern then I had tapped, I looked at my friend almost to say ""did you hear that?"" and she looked at me and I could tell by the look on her face that she was very scared. We both ran out of the room, and just as we got out the door, something grabbed Ashley's leg, she screamed, and pulled away, and we ran into the room across the hall, and when we looked back there was nothing there, so we sat down and she pulled up her pant leg and her knee was all red and blotchy. We were so freaked out that we never went in that room again unless there were a lot of people with us.

Another time, me, my friend (Ashley), and my sister, went to work with my dad, almost to see if anything else would happen. We were sitting in the bingo hall, when we heard this loud screeching sound, so we went to down the main hall to see if we could find where the should was coming from, we looked into the blue room and there was a chair dolly (used to move stacked chairs) on the dance floor, so we went over to it, and there were scratch marks on the floor behind it, like someone has pushed it, so I pushed it about a foot to see what it sounded like, it sounded the same as the sound we had heard. Later that night, me, my sister, and Ashley were in the stairs of the building, messing around with a copy machine, when my dad came down and said ""You guys are down here? Then who was flushing the toilets?"" It turns out then when we were down stairs, and my dad was up stairs, he has been hearing people running around in the bathrooms flushing the toilets.

So I read up on the American Legion a little bit, and found out that the American Legion had been used as a hospital for injured soldiers during World War II. There are a lot more things that have happened to me and other people I know, and I will be posting more stories soon.

Thank you for reading, and please comment and tell me what you think, or if you have any logical explanations.

Ghost Manifesting as Fruit Flies?,"New York, United States",Family / Friends Visits,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Family / Friends Visits :: Ghost Manifesting as Fruit Flies?

I 've never seen anything like this mentioned and hope someone can give me some insight.

My ex husband wound up being a really angry, hateful, mentally ill man towards the end of his life. Even after 5 years and several girlfriends, one of them serious, he never got over me leaving him. He always felt that I was his wife, his property to the end. He would vacillate between trying to destroy me emotionally and trying to bring me back into his life. He would forget all the resentment as soon as a real problem would occur. A problem with his computer, one of his animals, when he had his first heart attack, or subsequent chest pains and the heart attack that killed him he was on the phone calling me, completely forgetting the animosity. For the sake of the kids I did the best that I could to get along and except that he was unexplainable.

He died on his living room floor with my older child in attendance. He left the hospital after going in for severe chest pains. He insisted to the nurses that he was fine and stubbornly signed himself out. Within two hours he was dead at the age of 47.

Two days after he died, I went to his house alone to retrieve any paperwork and photos that belonged to me or us jointly that he kept. I wound up spending almost 2 hours there bagging up his clothing and sorting through what had been our file cabinet. As I was leaving, I was surprised to realize that I had never been bothered by being alone in his house, not by being alone at night and not by the fact that he had died there. I had found myself feeling very comfortable and safe. I decided later that I somehow knew his anger had died with him. That I was welcome into his home, welcome to take what was rightfully mine or ours and that he wanted me to take care of removing his personal items instead of his family members.

I went back several times with the kids and without to retrieve any items that were theirs. I never had that same feeling again but, always wondered if he was there watching.

A few weeks later, my current husband and I went to the house to get his lawn mower. This made me feel very uncomfortable as my ex hated my current with a passion. The feeling started long before we entered the house but, became very uncomfortable as my current husband looked at my ex's things. All very explainable with the conscious mind. I hadn't wanted my husband to even enter the house out of respect for my ex's feelings but didn't say so as I would have received a look that told me I was being ridiculous. After we had been inside a few minutes, the discomfort was becoming very strong. I wanted nothing more than to shoo my husband out the door and make a hasty retreat. I started feeling like things were falling on me as I picked up common household items like the tuna and spaghettios he kept there for the kids. I must have looked pretty silly ducking from the imaginary things attacking me from the tops of cupboards and the refrigerator. After a few minutes of that, and my discomfort growing to beyond uncomfortable, the fruit flies started.

Not real fruit flies but, again, imaginary ones. If you think of what its like in the summer to have a fruit fly or gnat buzzing around at the very edge of your peripheral vision you'll know exactly what I was seeing. A black dot almost touching the side of your head that you instinctively swing a hand at. Now, instead of ducking from invisible things, I was swatting at them. (Trust me, there were no fruit flies.) At this point I decided I had ignored the hint long enough, shoved the husband into the car and headed home, vowing never to bring him there again.

I went back to the house at least once after that but, never saw the fruit flies or had any feelings good or bad about it while I was there other than the expected ones. More than a year later, the house still stood empty waiting for the bank to foreclose on it. Life had taken on a new normal and we were preparing for our second Christmas since his death when I swatted at a fruit fly. Somehow I just knew that the house had been sold and he had moved in with us. I drove by the next day and while the house hadn't been sold, there was a for sale sign out front and a full dumpster. The bank had people come in and remove the remaining items while getting it ready to be sold.

I saw the fruit flies regularly for a few weeks, always on my right side but, they never bothered me. I even got up the courage to tell my husband (but not the kids) about it and my theory. He is very open minded and didn't seem terribly bothered by it either. We even joked about it once or twice, blaming my ex for taking things we couldn't find.

I talked to a psychic I know, she said that she felt that there was more than one, that he had brought family members with him and that this sometimes happens at holidays. That kind of bothered me. It was one thing to have my ex hanging around, another to have my mother in law visiting! One night, a month or so into the occasional ""sightings"" I was in bed alone. The kids were asleep and my husband working the night shift when I felt someone sit on the end of the bed. While occasionally seeing fruit flies that weren't there was acceptable, feeling things was not. I told the air in general: ""I don't mind you hanging around here and keeping an eye on the kids, however, you are not to make yourself known..."" That ended it. I didn't see another black dot, until the next Christmas when I saw one once, in the kitchen, the most common site and his favorite room. It was only when I was cooking, something he always loved. I felt as thought he was just saying hi and letting me know he was there.

I was reading ghost stories here and on Obiwan's site the other day when I saw a dot again, on my right side as usual. I couldn't help but feel like he was teasing me while I was frightened.

Now the question. Has anyone ever experienced or heard of a ghost manifesting itself as a black fruit fly like dot? I can't help but feel I am just a little out there with this one.

Computer Ghost,Australia,Misc,"I t was sometime around june in 2005, when I was in grade six. I was sitting at home on this very same computer, playing dress ups on a online dress up doll site. It was normal temperature that day, and all of a sudden, next to my right shoulder blade, it turned icy cold. Everywhere else was warm. I reached out into the cold area but my hand was stopped by something solid. Petrified, I stayed sitting in my chair. The next thing I knew, the mouse was moving around on the mouse pad. It was dragging the items of clothing onto the doll. It then logged itself into the chat room as, Kit_Kat221. I remember that well. The chat room came up on the screen, and the ""ghost"" began typing frantically to all the people in the chat room. I screamed and ran out of the room.

A few days later I walked into the lounge room to find the computer on. It was on a search engine, displaying pictures of cartoons. I walked closer to the computer and the computer turned off. The next day my mum got on the computer to find a picture of me with a cartoon cemetery and grim reaper standing next to me. No one had used the computer since that morning, and no one had changed the background. I became scared and one day I freaked myself out so badly that I refused to go to school. I was waiting at the bus stop an became very nervous and panicky. I walked back into my front yard, and turned around just in time to see a four wheel drive crash into the power pole I was leaning on at my bus stop, in the same spot I was standing. If I had have stayed there I would have been very badly injured.

Maybe the picture on my computer was telling me something. I became very shaken after that and spent the rest of the day in my bedroom. At about five o'clock in the afternoon my room turned icy cold. I went to run to the door but someone stopped my, firmly grabbing my shoulder. I looked but no one was there. Then a transparent light in the shape of a girl my age appeared in front of me. Then I heard a whisper saying ""goodbye..."". The light then disappeared and the temperature returned to normal. I haven't seen the ghost since.

Frightened,"Washington, United States",Apparitions / Voices / Touches,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Apparitions / Voices / Touches :: Frightened

O ne day, I was with my friends and we decided to go to our best friend's old house because she moved out. It was a very small house, 2 floors, an attic and a living room connected to a bathroom and kitchen. The house had been known to be haunted because a lady died upstairs in the attic in her wheelchair. The house was empty and all the lights were on and everything.

We walked through the door and we were VERY frightened on what we thought was going to happen. I didn't believe in ghosts until after this. I was very young during this. We walked through the living room and then turned to go up into the attic, where my friend's room was (where the old lady had died at). A girl was in front of me and one in back of me too. I was in the middle. As I put my foot on the first step I heard a very strange voice. Not knowing if I actually heard it I turned around. My friend looked back as well, she heard it too! We went up the stairs. There was a little box in the middle of the room. I told my friend to go get it. I tried to scare her, so I yelled loudly. Then we all started going for the stairs and running. The lights where flashing on and off everywhere. There weren't any lights upstairs though! As we ran down the stairs we all fell down at the same time. Bam! right on our butts at the same moment screaming we ran out of the house. The door was closed but we left it open. We never went back, EVER.

Little Blond Girl in my Room,"Missouri, United States",Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: Little Blond Girl in my Room

I am andrea and I'm 14 years old. This story took place when I was about 10 years old. It was christmas eve, right before we went to bed, my little sister Madeline came in to my room and asked me if she could sleep in my bed with me, keep in mind my sister was only 6 years old and afraid of Santa. I told her she could and I got up to tell my mom and her boyfriend good night and grabbed myself a glass of water. I went back upstairs and fell asleep.

I woke up in the middle of the night and saw this little girl sitting on my side table, on her knees, looking like she was praying... You might say that since it was in the middle of the night I was dreaming... But I wasn't, I grabbed my cup of water and splashed it on my face to make sure that I was awake and I still saw the girl. I tried to wake up my little sister but she is the hardest thing to wake up. So she didn't wake up. I asked her who she was... No answer.  I went under my covers and went back to sleep... But before I went back to sleep I heard her walk away so I looked at her... She turned around ONLY for me to see her appearance and then she was gone. Her appearance was a blond thin long haired girl with blue eyes and she was wearing a green dress that went down to her knees and green shoes with little bells on them. I woke up the next morning and told my mom and her boyfriend about it and what she looked like and they told me that they didn't believe me.

That is until... the next week, my mom's boyfriend saw her walking through the house in the middle of the night.

If you read this story tell me what you think because I NEED to know what you think!

There Are Others in my House,Puerto Rico,Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: There Are Others in my House

I have a new relationship. My daughters, my new companion and I were searching for a new place to live. We saw so many houses, but this house in particular attracted me to it. Why? You will find out later as I go on. This house was very old. Two weeks passed while still searching. We passed the same area again and still had the rent sign. The impulse was so great, I called the owner and we moved in two weeks. The place was not so fine, the walls had termite problems, a lot of wore down boards. Anyway I liked it, but my husband didn't. He always felt uncomfortable. I found it peaceful until things started happening. He would change mood when he entering the house. Always mad, complaining about everything. I had enough and I always ended up wanting him to go. But when we talked about our differences, we always talked outside the house. His mood would change. But when back in the house, he started again.

I am a sensible person, I see things. But I'd rather not try to communicate with these forces for obvious reasons. Each person has their own judgment on what these phenomenons are. For me, they are demons, wanting to have fun with people. But others, just being there. To be part of what they don't have. It is not explainable why they are just around one's house or apartments. Why linger?

The first weeks were fine. Then the experience... You remember in the movie ""The Grudge"" where the couple experienced some knocking on the wall. Well! The same here. But the knocking was just taps on the wall. At my husband side of the bed's wall. I always said it was just some mice. This always happened when we were in bed, resting. We tried to feel the vibration of this tappings. But it stopped when we got closer to touching the wall. Once I was so fed up that I told it to go somewhere else. WELL! It did! It went to my side of the bed wall. I told it to go back, WELL! IT DID! That freaked me out. I did not know what kind of forces we were having. But I had to be careful.

During the daytime, I felt someone watching me, I was seeing a transparent apparition of a small girl. But, I didn't feared it. Because I sensed it was not bad. I just looked at her and continue with my things. She never appeared often. She was quiet. I have a diabetic daughter. One night, while sleeping, this entity moved my arm. I woke up, saw her, and it pointed me to go to my daughter's room. My daughter was not feeling fine. This happened three times, and in these three times, I had to go to the hospital to emergency because of her condition. The entity warned me.

Once, when all was sleeping, I just opened my eyes to see her next to my husband side of the bed. She just stared at him. Why? I don't know. She was very a bright apparition. I woke him up, so he could see her. He tells me he can't see her, I am the only one with this gift. Well, I just went back to sleep, said nothing to the girl, as I don't want to communicate with it.

One night, we returned home, I turned on the living room lights, and my little daughter went pass the office room, and the lamp lights turned on. She got scared, I told her it's probably the heat that turned it one. It was a touch lamp.

Once she saw this little girl. She never has seen these kind of things. Once she passed the office area and saw her. Then she looked again and was gone.

Finally my husband saw it, thinking it was my daughter, but it was impossible. My 14 year old daughter was with my smallest child, in the living room, playing. I went to my bedroom with my husband to rest for a while. We have a walk-in closet, but it has no doors, just a curtain. He sees the curtain moved to the side, and saw a head poking out. I saw the same thing, but said nothing, because I thought he would not see her. But, to my surprise he did see her. He tells me ""How did Thalia get in the room, she was in the living room, and I closed the door?"" I told him, what he saw was the little girl. He freaked out.

There were more occurrences at this old house, but now I must rest, I will write more, stay tune. Goodnight!

The Bathroom Door,"Pennsylvania, United States",Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: The Bathroom Door

I 'm Cynthia, and my grandparents house has been where I've lived until I was about 11. My mother and I had lived with my grandparents in a wonderful house in Blue Bell. One day, I was around 7 years old, and I was sleeping in my mom's room because at the time, my room felt very eerie. In the middle of the night, I suddenly opened my eyes to the sight of the wall. I looked around in the dim room, and heard a creaking of the bathroom door which is located right on the other side of my mother's bedroom. My mom is woken up very easily, so I nudged her on her shoulder to tell her what I heard. Once she got up, I followed her to the bathroom. I am 100% sure that that night, right before we fell asleep, the bathroom door was completely closed. Well, at this point, it was all the way open! I looked at my mom in great surprise, the same she looked at me. She tried not to let me get scared at the fact that she was scared, too. She simply said uncomfortably that is was the wind, which was impossible because the bathroom window is always closed. We went back to bed unsure of any other encounters.

Since then, we have been experiencing many other scary things happening. Like when every picture we take in the house has huge orbs popping out at us. And when my dog continues to bark at the walk-in closet when me and him are sitting at the computer desk. Or when I was in my room, asleep, I woke up, and very vaguely saw a figure of a boy appearing in the corner, next to my closet, and looked at me, walked over to my bed, and collapsed on the floor, disappearing beside me.

I have known for my whole life that my house is set on the grounds of a campsite of the George Washington battleground nursery. This is where all the injured soldiers went to recover. My grandparents continue living there, and I visit all the time. I love this house, as it is where I grew up in. Fortunately, the spirits haunting the house will not drive me out.

Chair Being Pulled,"Kentucky, United States",Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: Chair Being Pulled

I have had some events happen to me and I can't explain some. But here is one that I will never explain. It was a warm summer day and I was in my room minding my own business. My parents were at work and they asked me to keep an eye for anything in the yard and I agreed to watch over everything. My oldest brother watched TV, I was simply reading a story on the computer and I soon felt as if my chair had been pulled. I almost fell out of it. Luckily I didn't. I looked around my room to see if anyone was there and no one was. No one could be in my room unless they went right passed me because my door is next to my computer and my brother was in the living room watching TV but no one was in my room except me.

I continued to read and I felt my hair being pulled. It hurt me and I screamed. It takes a lot to make me scream. I looked around and no one was there and I looked out the window and saw some goats. They weren't allowed in the yard so I told my brother but I didn't tell him what had happened because I knew he, of all people, would not believe his 14 year old sister. He went and started to shoot them and they left. I have always felt an odd yet safe presence in my room... I guessed I will never know.

Hotels and Death Spells,United Kingdom,Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: Hotels and Death Spells

F irst of all, hotels seem to be some of the most haunted places in the world. I have been in, not a lot, but a few. If you have visited a haunted hotel, post it in a comment. My story begins in an old Motel in Scotland. We were on our way to visit a friend named Sarah. My mom stopped at a hotel and registered us in for one night. When we got to our hotel, I got very cold, and started to cough.

Later on that night, I had a dream that my mom and I were huddled in the bathroom. A ghostly girl could be seen through the door (it was one of those see-through doors from an old hotel). She hovered and went to the bathroom. She chanted odd spells and words I didn't recognize. I saw the knob turning and then woke up.

I breathed heavily and turned on the light. There was nothing to be seen. Later on that morning, my mom said I had gotten a coughing fit during the night. She said she was really worried about me because my forehead was warm. When we checked out of the hotel, I got better right away.

Blob of Smoke at School,United Kingdom,Apparitions / Voices / Touches,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Apparitions / Voices / Touches :: Blob of Smoke at School

I was in year 2 when this happened, I thought there was a ghost in the toilet so I was very scared, I was so scared I had to have my friends to go with me. The school was called Bryn Coch and it used to be a victorian hospital! So, I was walking to the toilet with my best friend Kelly, I went inside the cubical when the lights flickered. I said to Kelly ""Ghost Help"", Kelly just said it was the electricity, I ran straight out. When I reached the corridor to my class I stopped to a sudden break, chilling shivers came from my shoulder down to my spine. Kelly was about 1 meter away from me. I saw a big blob of smoke disappeared through the wall! That was the first time I saw a ghost! I ran in the classroom crying when the teacher shouted ""There's no such thing as ghosts!""

I know the teachers just say that to stop us from worrying, don't you?

M y friend and I were at this hotel. The whole school was staying there because we just won a soccer tournament and it was promised to us if we won. Me and her unpacked our stuff and got online. She plugged her camera in her laptop and it all went black. We figured it was just something wrong with the internet. Then something from the computer came, it was a soft sound, like hearing someone scratch their nails on a chalk board. She shut it off and let it rest. Then we heard something in the hall. It was like someone stepping back and forth. We went outside to see if it was one of our friends but as we got closer to the door, the sound seemed to run away. When we got there, it was gone, but there was a white shadow by the door. We ran back in and called over to the neighboring room. They looked out and saw it next to their door. We all met in the middle where their was a door that connected both rooms. We decided to sleep together that night, but one of our friends got sick. When we left the hotel she was fine.

Mysterious Haunting,"Colorado, United States",Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: Mysterious Haunting

I t all started in a little neighborhood in Beverly, Massachusetts. My mom, my sister, our dog panda and I were just getting settled down in the new house when weird thing started happening. One evening, my mom and my sister went to grab groceries and I stayed home to work on my oral report. About three minutes after they left I heard banging on the door so I went to see who was there, but when I opened the front door, no one was there. I went back up stairs to work, but it happened again. At the back door this time. So I answered it again no one there. I only thought it was my nerves or my imagination so I went in to the kitchen to grab a soda and went back up stairs and that was it.

Then it was my mom's turn. I was at a new friend's house and my sitter was at the park, our mom was making lunch for us when we got back. When mom was done, she went out to the living room to read a book. About thirty minutes into the story, she felt someone breathing cold air on the back of her neck. When she turned around she saw a silhouette of a man in an army uniform. She was so freaked out, she left to go to a library, but since she was so frightened, she just sat there.

Next it was my sister's turn, she was sitting in her room playing with the miniature porcelain dolls Nana gave her, when one of them floated in mid air and left the room. She chased after it but it left the house and landed on three graves in the back yard. She told me, and I looked on the computer for any evidence or history that leads to the strange phenomenon. It said there was a family who lived there and the husband went psycho because he was a alcoholic and killed the daughter and the mother and after that buried them in the backyard and killed him self, but to tell you the freakiest part, the computer started typing in the words ""help us!"".

So we told mom and she called a cemetery keeper to come and buried the bodies in a marked grave and that was the end of our problem and theirs.

My Dad Saw his Own Ghost,"Wisconsin, United States",Misc,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Misc :: My Dad Saw his Own Ghost

I f you have read any of my past stories, you would know that I think there is some kind of spirit in my Dad's house. One night, while he was sleeping, he had a dream that a huge weight was laying on top of him. He couldn't move because it was so heavy. When he finally got enough strength to push the weight off, a person fell on the floor. He stood up to see if the person was okay. As soon as my Dad stood up, the person sat on the foot of the bed. My Dad touched him on the shoulder and said, ""hey man, are you okay?"" but when he looked at the man sitting on the bed, he realized it was himself! He jumped back panicking and a few moments later he woke up. He called me immediately to tell me this. I asked him if he had thought that he died when it happened, and he said, ""yes..."" We both agreed that it could have either been a near death experience, or just a strange dream. The next night, he dreamed the exact same thing. Then, he had that dream over and over again every night for about a week. One night, he fell asleep in the living room on the couch instead of in his bedroom. He did NOT have the dream when he slept in the living room. He slept in his bedroom again the night after and the dream happened again. He became afraid to sleep in his room, so every night, he slept on the couch in the living room. After a few months of that happening, it seemed to have just gone away and now he can sleep in his own bed again. If anyone has any idea what this could mean at all, I would really appreciate your comments! Thanks.

Something Holds Me Down,Australia,Old Hags / Night Attacks / Sleep Paralysis,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Old Hags / Night Attacks / Sleep Paralysis :: Something Holds Me Down

S omething, a spirit, ghost, or orb, I don't know what it is, finds me, my mother and my brother no matter where we move to. I'm here in Australia, my mom is in New Zealand. The first time it happened, I was 18, laying in bed, looking at my curtains when suddenly I couldn't move breath or yell for help. I told my mother and that is when she told me about all her experiences being held down and unable to move and speak. My Mother has seen something at the end of her bed, my brother has heard a voice (saying ""I'm back"") and the three of us get the same thing happening to us when we feel really tired - it happens in a second. You are like in a still trance and totally paralyzed and can't yell for help and you are AWAKE.

Last week after it happened to me 6 times in a row, straight after each other, I felt like someone was standing next to me, I looked and saw a faint white light. It moved from my right and went over my head, then over my husband's head, then stayed next to him. Around this white light was black waving like tentacles or maybe hair. This was the first time I had seen something and it was still there. I woke my husband and told him to put the light on. He had taken a sleeping pill and was too drowsy to get out of bed. I grabbed his mobile phone that when turned on, it shines a light, I put it on and we couldn't see it, when he turned it off it was still there. Until I eventually fell asleep, hours later, I never took my eyes off it. My body stayed cold and I had goose pimples all night. My husband doesn't believe in these things, but knew I was terrified of something that I couldn't take my eyes off.

I told my brother, he saw the same thing a week before me. Last night my mother saw it - her first time in 4 years but went further and it entered her body, she saw a figure of an old woman and the thing she remembers most is this woman's eyes, they were like lizard eyes greenly / bluish color. She saw from the corner of her eye my step father about to jump into bed she tried screaming out to him. He heard a faint noise and thought she was choking and grabbed her to bring her back. The second he grabbed her, she felt it leave her body through her left side. When it was inside her, she said it let her know that - it's back and has total control.

We have been blessed a couple of times and had our houses blessed and it goes, but comes back eventually. Me and my brother are scared of it. My mother isn't scared just really angry and pissed off with what ever it is keeps finding us.

What We See in the Corner of Our Eyes,"California, United States",Misc,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Misc :: What We See in the Corner of Our Eyes

A s a child I was always seeing things. Growing into a teenager I was ""spooked"" by weird shapes and I always ""felt"" things. At times I have had a fascination with air particles in a stream of light. Or the floaters in your eye... They always have interested me and sometimes I would adjust my sight to other things, like the density of walls. I guess I was trying to see the dynamics of matter. Well, quite a few times I have had the walls change into faces that change from one face to another and yet another over and over until I stop seeing that way. But if I gaze for any length of time at a blank wall for instance I start seeing faces. The faces bulge from the walls and look a little smaller then lifelike I sometimes wonder is that where they get the ideas for horror movies about the face that bulges out of the wall. Have other people seen this? What do you think? Are these ghosts I am seeing? The other thing is those white fluffy things you see in the corner of your eye and then you turn your head and they are gone. What are they?

I Saw the Ghost of a Little Girl,"Massachusetts, United States",Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: I Saw the Ghost of a Little Girl

O ne night I had awaken from a terrible dream. After a few seconds from awakening, I opened my eyes and saw this white figure that looked to be a little girl. I had closed my eyes in fear and when I peeped them open once more, she was in a different position! I was too afraid that if I opened my eyes again that she would be right next to my bed! So I kept my eyes closed and went back to sleep. The next morning I told my sister and mother what had happened, even about the dream. They didn't believe me and said I was just seeing things and that from having that dream I was imagining the figure.

That night, I had again awaken but not from a dream... My body can feel things and when it feels there is a spirit around my body will wake me, I saw her again! I was terrified! I didn't know what to do so, once again, I closed my eyes and tried to go back to sleep but I couldn't, not with the fear I was feeling. Once I heard my mom was awake, I told her I was seeing her again and she said ""it's ok just try to go to sleep please"". So I tried and it worked. But believe it or not, I kept seeing her! So the next night, after seeing her for three nights in a row, my mom and I prayed to that girl to leave me alone, and she did.

But a couple months later, when my mother and I were so close to falling asleep, we heard her speak. She said ""Ok..."". It was scary! I asked my mom if she heard that too and she said ""yes I did was that you?"". I said ""no I heard it too, what could it be?"" She replied  ""I don't know but let's try and get some sleep..."" and we did. The next morning I told her ""I think it was that little girl I saw a few months ago... Maybe she is stuck here..."". My mother said ""Maybe God asked her to come to heaven..."". I agreed, it made a lot of sense if you ask me! So that night I prayed to that girl to leave me alone and that I never wanted to encounter her again. Ever since then I haven't had any sign of her being here but I do know she is watching over me. Now my life has been better with out her encounters and I'm becoming happier and more safe. But I'm still afraid of spirits. I wonder what I'll encounter next.

Boxing Shadow Figure,Australia,Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: Boxing Shadow Figure

I t all started in 2003, when I started boxing with my friend Matt, we always went to the boxing center and trained there for hours, every day the owner would go out the back to have a smoke and to take the rubbish out. Most of the time it was only me and Matt there. While we were on the bags, Matt noticed a figure in the ring, Matt told me and when I looked it disappeared. I didn't believe him until I had a drink and looked around the center and saw it. It was the weirdest thing I had ever seen, it was like a shadow kind of thing. I told Matt but when he looked it disappeared, again. Matt went off at me and said ""I told you so..."".

The next day the owner died. The police said they didn't know what from, there was no signs of any body problems, no weapons of any sort, no bruising or cuts. After about a month, the new owner died. The same again. No problems with him or weapons etc.

The next time me and Matt went there, the ghost was there, though it didn't disappear at all, it was there all the time, the new owner saw it too, we called the police to come, though when they did, the ghost disappeared. The next week the boxing center shut down and has been for 3 years.

My 2 Years Old Sees a Ghost,"Tennessee, United States",Children Who See Spirits,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Children Who See Spirits :: My 2 Years Old Sees a Ghost

M y story begins a few years back, 10 years and 10 months to be exact. I was pregnant with my second child, a son, when my Papa passed away from an awful struggle against cancer. He truly loved my daughter and was heartbroken as he knew he would probably not meet his great-grandson. He had moved in with my mother for his final years. He died in what used to be my brother's room at my mother's home.

Last July, my mother retired and moved, myself and my fiancee bought her home (which was my childhood home). We completely remodeled the house. One day, I was alone at the house and painting my brother's old room. This room was to now belong to both my 10 years old son and my 2 years old son. I was up on the ladder trying to stretch-paint (not smart) when I lost my balance and saw my feet leave the ladder. I closed my eyes and somehow was put back and saved from falling! I had goosebumps but just said ""Thanks Papa"".

Two nights ago my toddler told me there is a ghost laying in his Bubba's bed. He has since started being very clingy. He is usually fearless and dark does not bother him. Last night, me and my fiancee were watching TV and my son was sitting on his bed playing Game boy. He said the ghost was there. We watched him, he was unaware we were watching, as he played, he would big-eyed look at the bed beside him. He did this for about 20 min. He never cried, just acted like he did not want to lose sight of ""ghost"". My two older children were not here at the time.

Boogeyman,"California, United States",Misc,"T his happened to me and my little cousin a few years back. I was babysitting for my aunt and I had just put my cousin to sleep. I turned around and began walking down the hall into the living room. I had just sat down when I heard my cousin screaming. I stood up and walked into the room where she was sleeping. I saw her, crying. I asked her why she was crying. She said what I thought was the boogeyman. ""There's no boogeyman"", I said, ""just go to sleep"". I left and twenty minutes later, this happened again. I went in the room and saw her crying. Then, I heard the crash. From inside the closet. My aunt's closet door began rattling. It was a big walking closet with a door and everything. The handle began turning back and forth and the door finally opened a crack. I picked up my cousin and we ran into my older cousin's room. I never told my aunt what happened. Even if I wanted to tell her, I don't know if I would. And since then they have moved and now live in New Mexico.

Has this happened to anyone else babysitting? I know a babysitting job is the perfect setting for something completely terrifying to happen and I was wondering if this happened to anyone else. Oh by the way, my little cousin is now 8 and I told her about what had happened and she thinks I was trying to scare her. She doesn't remember it.

Baguio's Chills,Philippines,Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: Baguio's Chills

I learned this story from my cousin. She visited Baguio last year. She told me that Baguio is not only famous and beautiful but also chilly. My cousin Angella visited a very luxurious hotel. I know the name of the hotel but I will not tell since the hotel might lose its publicity.

One day when Angella visited the hotel, she felt something spooky but she didn't tell anyone because maybe all the people there might think she's a freak. That night she slept in one of the most beautiful rooms in the hotel. She heard some noise. She thought it was her roommate Clarisse. ""Clarisse could you stop making noises I'm so sleepy"", shouted a very sleepy Angella. But Clarisse didn't reply. Suddenly she heard gun shots and people shouting. Angella thought it was just some of the kids in the hallway. Angella was very tired of the noise that she shouted. Clarisse woke up. Finally Clarisse told Angella that she was so scared. She told her that she dreamt that so many people were killing each other.

Unable to stand their fear, they asked some workers about the history. They told them that it was really where the Philippines-Japanese fight was held. It was a bloody one. Sometimes they could see a lady asking if they saw her head. They told Clarisse and Angella everything. Since Angella and Clarisse were so scared they checked out. They promised that they would never go to Baguio.

The lesson from the story is to always learn the history of a certain place.

While I Was About to Go to Sleep,"New York, United States",Old Hags / Night Attacks / Sleep Paralysis,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Old Hags / Night Attacks / Sleep Paralysis :: While I Was About to Go to Sleep

A t around 2:00 this morning (3/22/07) I turned off my lights and I had laid down to go to sleep. I had one arm above my head on the pillow and the other was down at my side. Both of my palms facing upwards. After about a minute I had started to feel a tickle, almost an itch. I decided I would move my arm that was above my head to go scratch it, but I couldn't lift it. I felt really confused, but I decided I would just use my other hand. I couldn't lift it either. I then started to feel pressure on both my arms. I was scared. My eyes widened and I grew extremely concerned. I couldn't understand what was going on. My arms were starting to hurt from the pressure and I still couldn't move them. I was being pinned down. I was too scared to make a sound (and also considerate of the rest of my family sleeping). I started to feel that tingling feeling all over. I couldn't do anything though.

The strangest thing happened next. My hands started to move on their own. They felt as if they were being pushed open and closed. This all went on for about fifteen minutes. After a while the pressure started to lighten and I was finally able to move my arms. I turned onto my side and felt that maybe now I could get to sleep. I started to feel it again. This time it felt as if someone was laying behind me and wrapped its arms around me. Yet again I couldn't move. I started to feel the tingling again. This went away after two minutes though. That was all. Though, strangely, as I started to type all this my nose started to bleed.

This isn't the first time I've had some sort of encounter while laying in my bed. This next bit would be too short an experience to make a full entry so I'm adding it to this one. I was laying in my bed about a year ago. It also must've been around 2 AM. Suddenly it felt as if someone had jumped on my bed at my feet. That end of my bed dipped and made lots of sound from something landing on it. I went to turn my light on, but nothing was there.

These are my experiences and I am being completely honest. I swear it.

Black Thing,United Kingdom,A Haunted Life,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: A Haunted Life :: Black Thing

T hat is the name of our follower, The Black Thing. It haunts me and my three friends Shaz, Olivia and Tasha. Ever since my first dream, we have been seeing this thing pure black with red gazing eyes. In my dream it killed my mate tasha. Ever since it has followed us around. For example, when me and my three friends go to a school in our area for work experience, every now and then it runs from the front door to the back door. We don't know what it means at all... But my friend, Olivia, is afraid that it is a evil spirit and it is out to hurt her. It is! Last Night it came into her dream and strangled her, it has also done this to me and Shaz but not as serious, she was rushed to the hospital and has to go back next week. Shaz is psychic so she has been telling us what is going to happen in our lives and it doesn't look pretty...

I believe that it is there to help us, guide us through life. Although you can never tell what a black spirit can do! Sometime soon we are all going to use a ouija board so we can find out more! Right now it's watching me brush my hair, and I know it will be watching me forever...

Breathtaking Noises,American Samoa,Apparitions / Voices / Touches,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Apparitions / Voices / Touches :: Breathtaking Noises

I was staying the night at my friend's house and we kept on hearing strange noises and footsteps. I stepped outside the bedroom door to see if anyone was out there and there was nothing but darkness. I went back and tried to get some sleep. The second I closed my eyes the noises started again. So I went to the door again and it sounded like someone was running down the hall. I lost my breath and ran back to the bed and woke up my friend. The noises just kept coming back and my friend and I were scared to death.

She had told me that a man killed himself in that house. At 3:00 a.m. I ended up walking home. I was so scared and there was nothing I could do. I never expected anything like that to happen. I never believed in the whole ghost thing but now I'm a believer. Some people believe me and some people don't. Its a thing that I like to keep to myself usually. Now every night before I go to bed I watch Ghost Hunters and struggle to sleep. Nothing since then has happened but I still think about it all the time. It was something I will never forget.

Knocking at my Door,"Vermont, United States",Old Hags / Night Attacks / Sleep Paralysis,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Old Hags / Night Attacks / Sleep Paralysis :: Knocking at my Door

I 've been googling and trying to look up ""knocking on the door and no one there"" and came to this web site. I've found many interesting reads here. I would like to add my own personal experience. Usually my troubles come when I am sleeping and always at 3:00 am. There used to be a dark silhouette of a man standing at the foot of my bed and letting out a terrible holler so terrifying it woke me up and I would be in a panic attack. I would also get a knocking at the front door at 3:00 am (again would wake me up) and I would go to see who was at the door and no one was ever there. I moved last April and didn't have anything happen until around November. Every once in awhile I hear that knock at the front door. When I first heard it I was afraid I'd get that figure at the bottom of my bed again but I have heard the knocking several times and the figure has not returned.

Last night it happened again at the same time - 3:00 am. I went and looked but no one was there. I don't understand what I'm experiencing and I'm wondering if it is a good spirit at the door trying to warn me about something or if it is a bad spirit trying to get me. I've been told it could be attributed to PTSD but I have had no reason in the past year to have anything reactivate that. Also, when I'm sleeping sometimes I feel like I'm being pressed hard into my bed and sometimes I feel like I have a ghost in my body and all I'm doing is projectile non-stop vomiting. And of course when I wake up I'm panicking. I guess that has happened only once since I moved.

Cat-atonic,"Texas, United States",Old Hags / Night Attacks / Sleep Paralysis,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Old Hags / Night Attacks / Sleep Paralysis :: Cat-atonic

M y story begins a couple of years ago. I'd just moved into my new apartment and was beginning a new life as a returning college student, working part-time as a bookkeeper for a grocery store. Two months pass and my life has pretty much settled into its new routine. One day, after pulling another all-nighter for an exam, I hop into bed shortly before the sun rises, anxious to catch up in my sleep before the start of my first class (which, for this particular day, wasn't until 1 in the afternoon).

It wasn't long before I started to feel myself drifting off when, from out of nowhere, I spotted an orange-ginger colored cat skulking around my legs at the foot of my bed. When I tried to move to get a better look at it, though, I found myself paralyzed. To the point, I was lying on my side, facing my room directly across from my closet, with my right arm tucked under my pillow. From the corners of my eyes I could still see the cat. It was small, about the size that a 6-month old kitten might be, but I could never see its face. It would always walk out of my line of vision or turn its head just enough so that I could never get a good look at it.

For whatever reason it kept trying to get under my covers, but there was something about this cat that didn't feel right. I didn't think it was there to hurt me, but I felt like it was malicious and dangerous somehow and I didn't want to have anything to do with it, so I struggled against it. I fought hard but it was difficult because it felt like something was holding me down from the inside out. The best I could do was to move in short, jerky movements. I tried to yell, too, but it was no good --- nothing better than weak moans.

Despite this, however, I managed to keep the cat out for a short period of time until it finally managed to find an opening that I wasn't able to move quickly enough to block off. Watching it sliding under my covers made me panic, and that gave me just enough strength to free my arm from under my pillow --- but, just as I did, I felt something grab my wrist and push my arm back down just over my head.

As the cat disappeared under my blanket, I felt an urge to look towards my closet, and there I saw jet black smoke pouring out from under the cracks. I panicked again, only this time I also became very angry, and I pushed against whatever was holding me down. I don't know if it was from my own power or if the thing just gave in, but I was freed and the first thing I did was barrel towards the closet door because --- in the heat of the moment --- I wanted to face whatever was in there. Despite being so scared, I was just so enraged.

But when I reached my closet and attempted to open the door, it wouldn't budge, and then this horrible mocking laughter filled my head. It was enough to make me dizzy, and I had to take a few steps back until I reached my bed again. I sat down to help regain my equilibrium, but then, as I looked up to re-survey my situation, I saw this dark spot forming in the upper right-hand corner of my room. It spread quickly, like ink in water, and before I can do anything about it I blacked out.

When I came to again, I was back in bed. The first thing I did was to look for that damn cat, but it wasn't there and neither could I find any evidence that it had ever been there, and when I looked through my closet everything appeared normal. By this time it was a little passed 8 AM, and nothing seemed unusual. I got back into bed and sat there for a very long time, trying to determine if what had just happened had only been a very lucid nightmare. It was strange as I'd never had an experience like that before, and never a dream so real.

After a while, with nothing else to go on, I attempted to shrug the experience off as a dream, but I was still shaken and found it hard to relax. I tried to force myself to go back to sleep because I had a long day planned later, but I just lay there staring up at my ceiling for a while, just kind of afraid to close my eyes.

And then, from the corner of my right eye, I see the orange-ginger cat walking by the side of my head. Before I can react to it I feel its tail hit me right under the chin. I leapt up in my bed into a full standing position, but the cat was nowhere to be found.

To this day I still question whether my experience had been real or just a very vivid hallucination, but the feel of that cat's tail on my skin remains a very constant reminder of that moment of my life. Since then, I have never had a similar experience.

NOTE: (I don't do drugs, not now or ever. I don't drink, I don't smoke, I don't meditate, and I wasn't sick on the morning in question)

There Are Others in my House II,Puerto Rico,Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: There Are Others in my House II

H i. Let me state first, my name is Rossana. I will continue what occurred in his rented old house . I heard it was 100 year old, it looked like it, but fixed a little. Here in Puerto Rico, a lot of houses, especially made in wood, do get harsh termite damage. But the paint covers it.

Another occurrence: Once my hub and I had an argument, I left the house, to do some shopping, my kid were with their natural father. He was left alone in the house. I was so angered, I wanted so desperately whatever was in the house to spook him. Believe me, I so repented, I shouldn't have done that. Because, when I got home, he told me, while he was eating his breakfast, I left it on the dinning room area, he heard like if pots were being thrown. He went to the kitchen, and saw everything was fine. But he really got scared! He even talked to it. He said whatever that did this, to be on its way, it did not have any means to be in the house, be off!

Our neighbor was a weird guy, often late at night, we could hear him cussing, and kind of fighting, but with his home, as you will find out later. Well, this made me laughed. But it frightened me a bit. What I did was dangerous, but yet, I felt, he was not in danger, because I knew this little girl hated the argument we had. But, who or what was this entity that made my husband change his persona? As I always said, one thing leads to another.

We were ready to leave the house and go shopping. We are again in a argument. I left something in the house and went back. When I opened the door, from the corner of my right eye, in the living room, I saw this lady, yelling, close to me, but her voice seemed like from far distance, saying angrily: ""todos los hombres son unos idiotas, no vale la pena,!"" (Men were idiots, they are not worth anything!), and cursing. I just went and got out fast, because I did not know who she was, but she is what I think made my husband uncomfortable in the house. He hated that place. I told him he had to be careful, because the little girl hated argument, and this lady provokes it.

One night, the little girl was moving my arms, I got up, went to my kids room, woke up my daughter to see if she was fine. She was ok. So I went to my room and slept again. Again she wakes me up, but all is fine. I told her to stop, she did, but then it starts again. I told her to go bother someone else. Well! She did, my next door neighbor. It was 1:30 something in the morning, when I hear him trying to close the door of his house, but couldn't. He was so mad and cursing.

One night, I had to go to the kitchen for a glass of water. While walking to my room, I felt something pushing me to the wall. I ran so fast, because all was dark! When I went to my room, I turned on my room light, and peaked out the hallway to see if I could see something, but gladly, I saw nothing.

This really scared me, I felt I was being targeted. I told my husband I had to find out what this entities were. Next day, outside of our house, our neighbor was passing by. I stopped him. I told him I have been seeing strange phenomenon in this house, and told him what I have seen. He asked me to describe them to him and I did. He started crying. He said, the lady was his wife, the child was her granddaughter. His wife died of AIDS, the child died of some sickness. He told us his wife was very outgoing person and kind of a loudmouth. Well, that's her description.

I always knew the ghost were not from this house. The owner of this house are our neighbors family. Well, at least that explains that.

But what about the eerie sound of children crying and some other occurrences in this house, there is more. It does not stop here. Until next time. Good night.

Our New Home,"California, United States",Poltergeists / Physical Manifestations,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Poltergeists / Physical Manifestations :: Our New Home

I have a story that I would like to share with you. Make of it what you will. I just wanted to get it out. I live with my wife of three years. We have four children that range in age from 9-16. Two boys, two girls. We first moved to Marysville in august of 2004. We bought our home there right before the housing bubble popped. Four bedroom, 2 bath with an add on, for less than 300k. The house itself was built in 1976 and is one of the many homes built around Beal Air Force base.

Two weeks after we moved in, we came home to have all our kitchen table chairs stacked on the table. Over the next few months, lights would go on and off, or doors would open or shut for no reason. One event that stands out was when my wife was in the bedroom cleaning and the TV turned itself on and off and on again. I saw this happen once as well. We also have had our dog freak out and go barking at the air in the room. Scared and unwilling to leave a corner. Our kitchen sink was filled with water on both sides once. Scolding hot to the touch.

I woke up to go to the bathroom early in the morning and was dazing looking at the tiles on the floor by my feet when I noticed a woman in the shower door way. I ran in the bedroom and when we went back nothing was there. Mostly lights go off and on. Music can be heard now and then. We can't move because we are negative on the value of the home now due to the market. I went to make dinner one night and all the stuff in the cupboard was upside down. We also have had food spoil over night. Such as fruit left out or bread mold over.

Plants don't live long in our home. Sometimes we hear tapping through our stereo or computer speakers. It always is the same repetitive sound. My 16 year old has also seen mist or hazy cloud in the upper corner of his room. My 14 year old daughter has heard things as well as seen stuff. Though we try not to talk about it openly in front of our younger children. Out of sight, out of mind so to speak.

We try to put it out of our minds most of the time and it seems to have slowed down since we do that. But we still get odd things or the flash of something in the corner of our eyes. I felt something sit on the bed once. It scared me big time. So nowadays, things spark up once every few days. But it has been awhile for anything big. Knock on wood.

Picture of Something Strange on my Shoulder,"Arkansas, United States",Photographs / Videos / EVP,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Photographs / Videos / EVP :: Picture of Something Strange on my Shoulder

A friend and I were taking pictures of me with my web cam. I was trying to get a good shot, so I was taking several at a time. I think I took about thirty or so. Then after I took the pictures with the web cam, we started taking a look at them. We were looking to see which picture looked the best, as we were looking, my friend says, hey go back to the one picture we just looked at.

I scrolled back to the picture and I just couldn't believe what I saw and neither could my friend. It was an image of someone or something next to me on my shoulder. You can see it has long hair and eyes, nose, mouth. I was pretty freaked out about this at first. I am sure there is an explanation, but I don't have one. My friend and I were just sitting next to each other and we were not moving around and the background is a wall of sheet rock insulation with a mini fridge and some junk on it. After this I took more pictures with the web cam and did not see this image or any others like it or any thing close. As matter of fact we didn't see anything ever again. I have been since then, from time to time, taking photos with this web cam when I was alone and have not seen anything.

Too Many Occurences,"Texas, United States",Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: Too Many Occurences

T here has been so much going in this apartment. We have lived here for 5 years and lately so many things have been happening. It seems that there are many more incidents and that it has escalated. My daughter and I used to sit in my bed to watch TV. Several times we would feel something knock against the bed as if it was under the bed. The cat was asleep so it wasn't the cat. I have heard footsteps when no one was about and they seem to stop before I can see who it might be. About a year ago, I felt something put its arms around my waist while I was sleeping. I could feel their warmth. That wasn't so scary but it was weird and very unsettling.

In the past year or two, sometimes my bedroom fan will work fine and other times it makes noises and drags and won't speed up. Our stove started ticking about 2 weeks ago like the timer might have been stuck. In the next few days, it accelerated and got fast and noisy. No investigation turned up a cause. Now it has stopped on its own and seems to be back to normal.

The other night, I was sleeping and felt someone grab my legs between my feet and knees and shake them as if trying to wake me up. I was terrified and could hear myself crying out but more whimpering and I had the hardest time waking up. It was like I felt what was going on but couldn't wake up. But I did and had no problems moving after waking.

Last night, while on the computer around 2am, I heard footsteps in the living room next to me. I seriously thought someone was coming around the corner and freaked. I stood up and thought ""what the hell am I going to do --how am I going to protect myself!"" they stopped short of coming around the corner of the room where I might see them and I got up and, of course, nothing was there.

So, last night, after going to bed... And I must admit, I was pretty upset by the goings on... I went to sleep and felt someone pulling my hair... Grabbing different sections of my hair and pulling fast and hard. I remember trying to grab my hair and crying out. My daughter was sleeping in my bed and I was whispering her name --like I was afraid to call out-- and I just scooted over close to her and went to sleep --or maybe I just never woke up. I'm not sure. It was so real but I don't remember if I woke or never did wake.

What do you think about all this? I am really freaked out and feel as if someone is in this apartment... A male... And not really evil but scary. Anyone's comments would be welcome.

It happened again last night when I was sleeping I felt it all over my bed, I screamed for it to leave me alone (in my dream) and then I thought to tell it to move to the light. Woke up. Then I thought it might be someone I knew and I told it not to be afraid and that I forgave them. I said again to move to the light. Got a little freaked so sat up in bed, turned on the light, turned up the TV. After a couple of minutes, I heard the wastebasket in my bathroom move across the floor. I wanted to be sure so I went and looked and wasn't positive, so I moved it back to where it had been. Got in bed. Had to be sure it had moved. Put it back to where I had found it after the noise and realized that yes, it had been moved. There is not a doubt in my mind that I heard it move --it's glass on a ceramic tile floor-- distinct sound. I'm beginning to think that by sleeping with the light and TV on, it's being foiled and not able to approach me. For the past couple of nights have slept with no light on but with the TV on... Last night it didn't seem to matter if the TV was on or not. When the waste basket in the bathroom moved I thought maybe this thing was mad because he couldn't get to me. Worried.

There is a Ghost in my Room,Zimbabwe,Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: There is a Ghost in my Room

I t all started when I was 11 years old. We moved into an old house. I mean old, it was built in 1898. I've always had a feeling about my room. Then it all started. I found my candle shoved in my game system. Then I found toothpicks shoved into the candle spelling out the word ""Amy"". Then myself and my best-friend were vacuuming my room and I asked her to plug in the vacuum across the hall. So she left my room and plugged it in. Then, when I turned it on, it wouldn't start. I said ""Nicos, I thought I told you to plug it in"". She said ""I did"". When I checked to see if it was plugged in, I opened my door and saw the plug laying on the floor right in front of my door. I plugged it back in and it worked fine. When I went to ravel up the cord I said ""Nicos, get off the cord"" because it was stuck on the carpet. She said ""I'm not on the cord"". She was sitting on my window seat on the other side of my room. But right in front of my eye I saw the cord stuck to the floor.

Recently I walked into my room and said ""Hi Klopo"" [Klopo is my cat]. Then I heard a little girls voice say ""Hello"".

Can Music Be the Cause of This?,"Texas, United States",Old Hags / Night Attacks / Sleep Paralysis,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Old Hags / Night Attacks / Sleep Paralysis :: Can Music Be the Cause of This?

T his actually happened to me, that one night for some reason I woke up at 3 am or so. And I was listening to music, and all of the sudden I heard a deep voice say ""Don't disturb the dreams of others or I will come for you"", and I was scared to death, and thinking to myself ""I'm not going to say a thing, neither wake up anybody"" and other stuff, and I heard that same voice say ""YOU DID IT!"" and I turned fast to the bedroom door, and there was this girl standing, moving really really slow towards me, and what amazed me was that I couldn't move, or scream, or anything, and like I had my arms cross if that means anything to people who have experienced stuff like this. So after a little bit, she disappeared and appeared, and every time I would stay frozen.

It wasn't a dream, and I know that for sure, because three weeks later, I went to my sister and her husband's apartment, on a friday night to celebrate his birthday (even though it was on that tuesday, they were going to work all week so we decided it to make it 4 days earlier), and for some reason I decided to go to their empty room and fell asleep on the floor listening to music. My parents finally woke me up at 11:30 and we went home.

So that whole week we didn't see my sister and her husband, but the next monday when I got to see them, without me telling them about what happened to me with the girl, they told me that strange things had been happening to them all week long, and it freak the crap out of me when they told me that he had his arm crossed whenever he felt something heavy on top of him that didn't let him scream or ask my sister for help, and even both told about how they each saw a girl, like he did, she did thing. So there, I definitely was sure it hadn't been a dream.

Some days later I traveled 12 hours into my home town El Paso, Tx, where most of my family lives. And my dad wanted to rest at my cousin's house, so I slept in the room with my cousin's, again hearing music. Next morning we went to Mexico, and two days later when we came back, my cousin's told me of some things he started to see including a girl. And I don't know, in my opinion is hard to make inferences off something because there might have been other factors that did this girl to come, but its just a really bad situation to face.

Convict Ghost,Australia,Apparitions / Voices / Touches,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Apparitions / Voices / Touches :: Convict Ghost

O n 19th March 2007 at A Birch, Brisbane, I was waiting for the sight seeing tour to begin at Port Arthur at the back of the main building. It was heading toward four-thirty in the afternoon, which is when the tour starts. I was sitting on the first bench near the tourist clock for the start of the tour. I saw a man six foot tall in old fashion overalls walk from the back of the main building and past before me on the seat and down the stairs and disappeared. I noticed as he was walking past he looked at me, he had long hair at shoulder height and old pair of overalls one strap hanging down and some type of old style shirt on and I'm quite shaw he had no shoes on. I thought he was a staff member dressed up for a show, thinking it was going to be part of the tour.

Now this is the weird thing, no staff dress up for shows. Ok apparently I had seen a ghost of a convict?

I latter found this to be a usual occurrence as others have seen what they thought were staff dressed up for a show and have turned out to be convict ghosts.

115 Years Old Slave House Haunted,"Ohio, United States",Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: 115 Years Old Slave House Haunted

I t all started when my best friend moved to a new house right behind a post office. The first time I went there was at her birthday party. The first thing she did was tell us the story of the house. It turns out that the house was 115 years old, at least. It had slave passage ways, most boarded up, but one, the one that went through her closet and connected her room to her step-sister's room was still open. Now, this was a few years ago. I was around 10 or 11, and I'd never had a ghost experience before.

We stayed up late that night, me and around 5 or 6 other girls, along with my best friend's older sister, Codi. We told ghost stories until late, then snuck down to get some candy to last us through the rest of the night. Sarah's parents were both asleep on the couch when we snuck by, and were still asleep when we made it upstairs and crowded into her step-sister's tiny bedroom, filled with junk because she didn't live there very often. We were discussing what we were going to do for the rest of the night, when Shelly, one of the girls, declared she was dressing up as a spy and went into the bathroom.

We started to argue over what we were going to do, when we heard movement in Sarah's room next to us. Thinking it was Shelly, I went out to tell her to get out of Sarah's room.

The exact moment I stepped out, the bathroom door opened and Shelly came out. She said she heard someone walking around in the bedroom. I told her we thought it was her. When I walked back into the room, people had their ears pressed against the closet door, listening through the slave passage. But when we walked in to grab our sleeping bags, because we weren't sleeping in there after that, and the lights were still off, there was nobody there. The only living, breathing souls in that room at the time were Sarah's two rats.

I Wish They Would Leave,"Mississippi, United States",Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: I Wish They Would Leave

H ere is a story that has taken place as long as I can remember. This story takes place in Hancock County, Mississippi. When I was a child I remember seeing different things in my grandmother's house. Throughout the years I have taken thousands of pictures and in every picture not one orb has shown. My aunt and uncle now live in the house she has also suspected that something wrong in the house. At night she would feel someone throw their arm around her when my uncle wasn't home. The toilet would flush automatically. During halloween you can hear children talk and run through the house. Now that they have children the activity has increased. Her oldest has seen her daddy's head in the closet. Now whenever I visit their house I always take pictures with the children in them. And every time I take one there are ten to fifty orbs in each one. It really bothers me that this is happening. Just a week ago I have taken roughly fifty pictures. Each time I take one I enlarge the orb and there is always a face present. Who knows how long this will last. So know I am urged to crack this mystery. Thank you for taking the time to read this.

Blonde Little Girl in the Mirror,"North Carolina, United States",Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: Blonde Little Girl in the Mirror

I t all began at my cousin's birthday party when I was 11, we went into my cousin's room and started to play and about 20 minutes later I looked into my cousin's big mirror and I saw a little girl with blonde hair and a white dress. She looked like she was about 7 years old. I know that I saw something because I was the only girl with my blonde hair and her hair was like white.

After we left the bedroom I asked my uncle if anything bad happened a long time ago in this house. He got a really weird look on his face and told me that this was a very old house then he asked ""what did you see?"", I told him about the little girl he said to me she would not hurt me. That night I was too scared to stay the night so I went home.

I have not been their since. I'm now 13 years old and I had to go over there to help my cousin and uncle move out because he could not pay the rent. So when we got over there, I asked my cousin if she had seen the ghost lately, she said no, so we helped them pack up their beds. We were getting ready to leave, me and my cousin were in her room and the mirror was still there. I saw that little girl again. But this time she waved at me and I waved back. My cousin saw me she asked ""what are you doing?"". I said I'm saying bye to the little girl... My cousin smiled and we left.

I'm pretty happy that they moved out but I'm going to miss the little girl. When I tell anybody about this they say I'm crazy. But for those who've had this kind of thing happen know what I'm talking about.

Are There Really Ghosts in my Basement?,"Maine, United States",Misc,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Misc :: Are There Really Ghosts in my Basement?

M y dad had heard voices in the basement. He said that he had heard the voices saying things like how his life has been, sort of like a storyline of his life.

Me and my cousin wanted to explore this subject further so we brought a camera downstairs. I took pictures everywhere in my basement. On the top of the stair rail there was a faint marking made with pen. If you look at it closely, you see that it said,""You took it off"". I couldn't believe it. There was a small hand-shaped sticker with fur stuck to the wall of the basement when we first moved in. My dad or mom must have took it off because it wasn't there anymore. The ghosts didn't like that, so they found a way to tell us.

One of the pictures we took on my camera actually moved. It wasn't a recorded movie, just a picture. It moved by showing a shadow coming closer and the air getting foggier. Another picture showed a blue tarp that was there hanging, like always. But another picture of the same tarp showed the tarp hanging from one strand.

I took a picture of a wall and it came out on my computer and camera as a face close up, showing a nose and eyes. It was a gray and slightly see-through face.

The last thing that happened was that my cousin took a flashlight and shined it at a white piece of paper. She took the flashlight away and then put it back. A quarter of the paper was missing. Later that week, I was on the downstairs computer and I heard an old woman's voice calling, ""Bradley, Bradley, Bradley!""

Please tell me what you think. Are there ghosts in my basement?

3:00 am Phenomenon,Canada,Demons / Possessions / Exorcisms,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Demons / Possessions / Exorcisms :: 3:00 am Phenomenon

I did have a bad experience about 4 years ago. But I think that I might have brought something with me when I went to that country where they worship demons (praying and giving them offerings so that they don't get troubled by them). I went to visit ancient sites when they had a lot of those worshipping hotels. I was kind of curious and I approached a lot of those. At times, I felt my ears were like blocking, couldn't hear properly. Afterward, I became weird and had bad thoughts (very unusual coming from me...).

After I returned home, I felt weird. I was seeing shadows out of the corner of my eyes. I surprised myself talking to it many times. One night my daughter woke up around 1:00 AM, crying, just to tell me that she had a bad dream and that she saw me being sucked up by a black tornado. I was still on internet searching for ghost and spirit stuff. Then I went to sleep.

At exactly 3:00 am I woke up from a nightmare. My heart was pounding like it was going to burst out of my chest. I never ever felt my heart so loudly pounding of my whole life! Then, suddenly, the TV turned on by itself. I got freaked up and told my husband about it. We woke up and then we were in total disbelief! Having not found any explanation to this, we went back to sleep.

The following night, same scenario. Nightmare, woke up at exactly the same time 3:00 AM heart pounding, TV turns on on its own, showing some worshipping temples. The same kind I saw in the country I visited (I prefer not to mention what country and what religion were the temples out of respect). The day before I had tuned the TV on that channel that has shows on spirituality. This time my husband prayed in front of the TV and then went back to bed.

On the 3rd night, I went through the whole thing again. Nightmare, opened my eyes looked at the clock's red numbers... 3:00 am. I really got pissed. I called my husband up and I said ""That's enough!"". I wasn't afraid anymore. I was totally pissed off! I told my husband ""I brought it here, I'm the one who has to kick it out!"". A sudden strength fulfilled me and I started to pray loudly, claiming clearly that my family belonged to God. And that I wanted him out of my life and that I wasn't afraid of him (I don't know why I felt it was a HIM). My whole body was trembling (I'm having goose bump when writing up this part) and the TV started to turn on and off until it finally turned off for good. I never felt so strong of all my life... ever. I was like a lioness protecting her territory and challenging an intruder.

I never had problems after that night when I stood up to it. But I was curious to know why 3:00 AM ? The weekend after, my pastor told me the whole thing about the evil 3:00 AM hour. I was shocked ! I am relived to see I'm not the only one that it occurred to, maybe differently but still the same hour...

In a Public Bathroom With the Devil ?,"Wisconsin, United States",Apparitions / Voices / Touches,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Apparitions / Voices / Touches :: In a Public Bathroom With the Devil ?

T his happened along time ago, when I was 14 years old. I was hanging out with a group of ""outcasts"", the dopers was what they were called at school. I didn't care because I started drinking with them and having fun and that was all that mattered then. I lived with my mom across the street from a bowling alley-bar. It was where all the stoners hung out and met up with each other. So one night, when I was hanging out just getting ready to go party somewhere, I went into the bowling alley to use there public restroom. There was like 4 or 5 bathroom stalls and I went into one and sat down (sounds weird, sorry it's the truth). I heard a deep growling voice from the stall next to me say ""I'm the devil"". That's it. I got so scared I remember feeling petrified. I didn't move for a few seconds, then I got the guts to lean over to see if I could see any shoes in the stall next to me, there was a ladies shoes (like pumps) Nothing weird about them, but I knew what I heard and she was the only person in there with me. She then stepped out and left the bathroom, said nothing more. I was still too scared to look out at whatever spoke to me. I was in shock! After a couple minutes I slowly exited and joined my friends outside, but I never said anything for fear that they would think I was losing it.

I carried this with me my whole life, what do you think it was? Anyone?

Unwanted Guests,New Zealand,Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: Unwanted Guests

B efore our family friends knocked down their garage to build a cottage for my mum, sister and I to move into, their two kids (my age) told me about the planks of wood on the ground containing the body of a murdered woman. Now, being 8, I was terrified but soon forgot all about it.

After a year, we moved into the cottage, my sister and I shared a bedroom whilst my mum was down the hall. On my first night, I laid awake not being able to sleep for I felt someone watching me, I turned over to look out into the hall where I saw a black image of what I think was a woman. I pulled the blankets up over my head and couldn't sleep for the rest of the night.

The next day me and our friends youngest son decided to explore under the house, all was fine until I stumbled across something all to familiar... Planks of wood directly under where I saw that figure the night before. I remember running quickly running out from under the house stumbling over my own feet and running into my mother's room.

Every night I lived in that house, I would see that very same figure staring at me. After about 3 years, things started to get really weird. One night, while my mum and sister were next door, I decided to stay home alone and watch TV. A storm started and I heard footsteps coming up the stairs to the front door (a glass ranch slider), then a flash of lightning revealed there was nobody there at all, terrified, I ran next door. After that night, things continued to get weird and I started to hate living there.

When I was 14, my mum decided to find a house with her long term boyfriend and I was rapt to be moving, and then things started to get really scary... After a sleep over with a couple of friends, I returned home to find my room completely trashed and things thrown everywhere. I confronted my little sister (11 years old), thinking she had done it, but nobody had been home all day. After that night, things would move in the night and our appliances started going crazy all night.

When we finally moved, I had never been happier, I now have my own room but sleep downstairs on my own which can be scary and if the house creeks. I still dive directly under my blankets, but so far I have not experienced anymore paranormal activity... But hey, I'm only 14.

Some people may choose to believe this story others may not... But I know what I experienced and since then have been a firm believer in the supernatural world.

Possessed in Dream,United Kingdom,Misc,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Misc :: Possessed in Dream

T his is perhaps beyond the realms of the usual, given that it was a dream. However I feel it has a couple of similarities to my "" I can see you "" story, and maybe dreams can be influenced by the dead?

It was the night of 23rd March, 2007. I was shattered from work and went to bed at about 7pm. I'm pretty sure it was a dream, where in it, I actually wake up and hear noises, crashing and banging. The next thing I know in this dream is that I have a feeling of evil and that there's something else in me. I feel possessed by a Demon. I'm filled with rage, malice and anger and I race down the stairs, but hopping on my left leg jumping four steps at a time feeling invincible.

I have enough control to look in the mirror and see red eyes staring back. I walk past my mother. Stop and stare at her. I continue to the next room and burst in on my father, and that's where the dream ends.

This dream was so vivid and detailed and again unlike anything I've ever experienced before. The surroundings were based in reality, it was my home I was walking around. I have to stop and wonder whether it really was a dream. Apart from the demon element, there was no other fantasy or made-up element that I have experienced in any of my other dreams. Could it have been something more than a dream? Could we be vulnerable to evil spirits in our sleep?

The Floating Lady with no Legs,"Illinois, United States",Apparitions / Voices / Touches,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Apparitions / Voices / Touches :: The Floating Lady with no Legs

O ne day, as I was sitting inside of my room, I heard a sound and I didn't pay any mind to it. Seconds later, someone knocked at the door and I got up to see who it was. As I got up, I open the door and there was nobody there. We lived in the basement so there were stairs and a wall in my way. As I went up the stairs, there was no one there, I thought it was my sister's boyfriend but there was no one there in the hallway. So I went inside the house and looked at the door and sat back on the bed and finished watching TV. 5 minutes later, I heard another sound and I turned around to find a lady floating, looking dead at me. Her eyes where red and she had on a gray dress and she didn't have any legs, she had long black hair, but she just looked. I woke my mom up to make her see what I saw, but she got up to late. As I jumped under the sheets, trying to hide from what ever she was, some one knocked at the door again and my mother told me to go get it. I refused and she got the door, this time it was my sister and her boyfriend.

I asked my sister ""did they knock on the door before?"" and they said no, they just got here. So I asked my mother if she had seen it because I told her about it, she said she only saw the end of her dress. I was only 9 years old and now I'm about to be 18 and I remember that day like it just happen.

The Haunted Art Studio,"California, United States",Ghost Hunting,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Ghost Hunting :: The Haunted Art Studio

W hat is the day today? Oh ya... March 17, 2007, Saturday. I'm sorry if I seem sort of discombobulated. I feel like I just came back from Disneyland. Disneyland of the Macabre. There was so much to see, so much to do and the added bonus is the fact that this art studio is truly haunted! On this night I went out with H.P.I. (Haunted and Paranormal Investigations) in Northern California. We all met first at Starbucks and had a quick briefing and I sucked down my Venti Caramel Macchiato. Let's take a roll call for the H.P.I. Paranormal Investigators, (the time is 8:45 p.m.): Shannon McCabe/Lead Investigator, President; Tim Hawkins; Michele Stump; Brian Colbert; Kristen Sheley/Researcher; Mary Casiano; Alicia Perry; Tech Supervisor, John Wachter; Lead Investigator Michelle Paykel; Julie English, Paul Dale Roberts; Ghost Writer. After the briefing at Starbucks, we convoy to the art studio.

The resident tells me that the place has been around since the 1930s. She is an artist and has all kinds of stories about this place. I will tell you why I call it the Disneyland of the Macabre. I'm not saying this in a bad way, believe me, the place is like a museum, there is so much to look at. But again, let me not jump ahead of myself. The resident, a very elegant lady, sits comfortably and explains to me that one time around 10pm on some given evening, she saw a dark shadowy figure of a man in one of the rooms. He just stood there, then glanced at her and walked away. During her first month at this art studio she was painting and listening to her music, not having a care in the world and then all of a sudden she heard footsteps coming up the stairs. The footsteps became louder... A clonk, clonk, clonk! It was very pronounced and startled her. She went to investigate and there was no one there. She has witnessed activity in the kitchen, bathroom and living room. In the kitchen, objects have flown off the wall. Full size apparitions have been seen by her guests in the living room area. According to the resident, one guest saw someone in her bathroom and thought nothing of it, then came to realize that there was no other guests present. The person she saw in the bathroom was a 55ish year old man, who looked Italian and had dark hair. When she went to the bathroom again, he had vanished. Another guest was sleeping on the couch and saw a man's face (the Italian male ghost/spirit) staring at him, face to face. Another story was of a plant that moved on its own accord. There have been hot spots in various parts of the dwelling. Yes, I said 'hot spots', not cold spots. Another artist, who was a guest of this studio, had dreamed that there were 13 entities surrounding him as he laid on the couch.

The history of this elaborate studio is that there was a restaurant downstairs and a nightclub upstairs. At one time this place was a ""speakeasy"" during the Prohibition period equipped with it's own escape route. During the 50s, it was a jazz club. It has also been a brothel and a Japanese Gambling Parlor. This studio has a lot of history. You can even see where the stage was for the band and a fairly large dance floor for patrons of yesteryear.

Now let's get back to that Disneyland thing I was talking about. The studio is like eye candy filled with relics. A guest of the studio tells me that she describes the studio as an ""eclectic mixture of religious icons which represent Catholic and Buddhist religions, with a variation of rebellious punk rock added..."" Yes, I would have to agree with her, this art studio is all that and more and delivers a bag of chips! As I surveyed the studio I saw various pieces of artwork, such as decrepit dolls, maniacal dolls, candles, dried flowers, voodoo type of dolls, skulls, disco balls, old photographs, beads, religious paraphernalia; plants, circus material, Gothic material, X-Mas lights and other assorted pieces of art. In fact the studio itself is one big art piece!

While the investigators were in awe of this studio, they walked around with their video cameras, walkie talkies, EVP monitors, temperature gages, while the TV monitors displayed what was being recorded. Did we see orbs? We saw orbs flying around everywhere, inside the studio and outside of the studio.

Another guest at the studio, along with his girlfriend lead me and another investigator to the cellar. In the cellar, we didn't discover any ghosts, but we found some old relics such as a cat's skull, tax forms dating back to 1942, an old jug, old bottles, light fixtures and a broken down chair. The cellar was treacherous to walk through, there was mud and huge gaping holes in which we could easily fall into. The resident even found some mummified feral cats in this cellar. I discovered a nasty black widow and I knew it was my time to leave.

As we headed back into the living room, one investigator's Electro Magnetic Field meter starts to fluctuate like crazy. Another EMF meter does the same thing. There is activity in the living room and two investigators feel a presence behind them. The presence is sort of ominous. The video camera records an orb that floats over to one and settles at her torso area and dissipates. About a minute later, she hears a rustling sound near her and jumps up from the couch in a fright! Was this the Italian ghost that the resident affectionately calls ""Tony""? The two investigators capture some gorgeous orbs on their video cameras and are delighted to show me their photos.

Around midnight, we started rounding up all of the equipment and were headed for home. When everyone works as a team and we all experience something out of the ordinary, it brings a closeness to the H.P.I. Team. A closeness of all sharing similar experiences, which leads to a feeling of being part of a family. A family that greets and departs with warm hugs. We all know that we braved through another investigation and we survived this adventure into the unknown. As I drive away, headed for home, I put on some mood music and one of the songs was ""Sail Away"" which picked up my spirits and the next mood song was the theme from the Exorcist. Oh no, let me pull out this CD! I don't need to hear that! If you would like more information about H.P.I., please visit their website at: http://www.HPIparanormal.net

The Ghost  that Followed Me,United Kingdom,Misc,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Misc :: The Ghost  that Followed Me

I was coming down from my room when I paused and saw a shadowy figure with a hooded cloak. Then it came to me and put its hand on my shoulder, but the weird thing was I didn't feel anything! It then just disappeared into thin air. Then the next day, I went down again and I felt a shiver down my spine, I stopped walking, I heard a moaning noise coming from the cupboard under the stairs. I walked down the stairs and went to inspect the moaning noise, I opened the cupboard door and saw a shadowy figure again bending down with a knife! I told my mum there was a ghost she said it doesn't matter because we were moving house tomorrow! So I shouted yippee!

We moved house to a nice cottage. Then I went and chose my room and put all my stuff into it. I saw the same ghost on the chair outside my room, I gulped and ran past the horrible thing and shouted GHOST! So I told my mum and she said there's no such thing as ghosts! I said I'll show you so we walked upstairs and it was gone, she said stop lying! From that moment on, I was scared of going upstairs.

I moved to a room downstairs and I never seen the ghost again.

Face Behind the Curtains,"New York, United States",Apparitions / Voices / Touches,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Apparitions / Voices / Touches :: Face Behind the Curtains

T his happened last night on 3/24/07. It was about 1:30 a.m. My cousin and I couldn't go to sleep because of the noises and things we saw. My uncle and aunt were sleeping. We were the only ones awake and we were alone in the living room. My older cousin was working. My younger cousin and I were telling stories. That's when I heard a whistling by the bathroom. My cousin then told me she wanted to go to the bathroom and when I told her what I heard, she didn't want to go. Then my older cousin came and started eating in the living room where we were. My uncle came out of his room and told us about a dream he had. I wasn't paying much attention because I was being distracted by something I saw behind the curtain. I was looking closely and it looked like an old woman's face. Then the face disappeared but I still saw a bump behind the curtain. I went to check with fear. I opened it but I didn't see anything. I didn't tell anyone until the next day to not scare them. I still never found out what was actually behind the mysterious curtains.

The Night I Started to Believe,"Indiana, United States",Apparitions / Voices / Touches,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Apparitions / Voices / Touches :: The Night I Started to Believe

I was about 13 years old when this happened. My parents were out at a concert with some friends and I was at home watching my little brother. The first part of the night was fine but at about ten o'clock I heard a high pitch scream. I figured that it was my little brother having a bad dream so I went up to go check on him. When I got in to his room he did not seem as if he was having a bad dream. I stayed in there for a moment to see if he would scream again.

He didn't, someone else, or something else, did. I was still in the room when another scream came from the down stairs. I freaked out. I called my parents crying and telling them to come home. They just told me that it was all in my head and for me to go and get some sleep. I did not feel safe with my little brother being in his room all by himself so I brought him to sleep with me. About ten minutes after I got in bed a door slammed. None of the windows were open so it wasn't the wind. I decided to go look for whatever was making all of the noise. I brought my guitar with me to hit it with... Like that would help any. I saw nothing upstairs or on the main floor but when I went into the basement there was on unfamiliar figure huddled in the corner. I did not think it saw me but it was crying very hard. I do believe it was a child, about the age of four. I was freaked out by what I saw. It did not look threatening. It was fairly translucent but not all the way. I went in my room and locked the door and waited for my parents to get home. I fell asleep before I could tell them about everything.

The next morning I did some research on the house. We were living in and it said there was jewish family that lived during the Holocaust. They all were taken to auschwitz concentration camp, all but the youngest, they have no idea what happened to that one child and I believe that I saw the one child that was left behind and that he came back looking for his family and they were not there.

Mayor's Hall Ghost: a Jesuit Monk,Puerto Rico,Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: Mayor's Hall Ghost: a Jesuit Monk

T his happened in 1985, in City Hall in Ponce, 'Casa Alcaldia'. My friend and I were attending an Art Exhibit. I saw a Monk, he had a long brown habit, a long rope like tied around its waist, and a long cross made of wood. It seemed like wood. His top head was shaved. I looked at him, from behind only, I asked my friend if she saw the monk, she said she didn't see any monk. I told her to follow me, so she can see him. She couldn't see him. I tried to see his face, but I couldn't. I tried but he continue walking. I only got to see his ears, but not the side of his face. It was looking at the paintings. Then he started walking.

I told my friend to follow me. I am following him, because I never seen these kind of father, dressed in that manner. Then he turned to the left side stairs to go to the second floor. I thought the second floor must be opened to the public. So I followed. When I turned to go upstairs, the gate was closed. No one was up there. It was dark. She asked me what was wrong with me, I said, forget it, I thought I saw a monk. Well, I did see it!

Two years later, I was called to work at City Hall's Tourist Department located outside the same building in the first floor. One day, our supervisor told us to do a research on some interesting point in town. I asked him about the buildings history, he told me it used to be a Jesuit Church, and nearby was a cemetery. I asked him if he ever heard of any strange stories about the place. He did, and he experienced one. He said, he was alone one night, looking for something having to do with Ponce's Carnival. He saw a tall man with a black cape and hood on. Only touched his hand and it was cold. Why it did this? He does not know. Then he vanished.

One day a worker and I went to the second floor above the office. I opened the lock. I put the lock in a secured place. Then we went looking for some costumes. When we were done, the lock was not there. We were frightened. After a long time we found the lock. On a seat of a chair. We went fast. I had stomach pains because of the fright. I never went up there again.

Then I learned there were stories about this place where people have seen apparitions of monks, slaves and other people. SCARY!

Opening Doors,"Illinois, United States",Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: Opening Doors

O ne night, me and my best friend stacey were home alone and we were watching the simpsons. We had both of my cats oreo and smokey with us. Before we made sure all the doors were shut. We were sitting there. All of a sudden we heard the door open so we got up and went to look. It was closed... Then we locked it and checked the other doors and nothing was there. We went back watching the simpsons and heard the door open again (now remember we locked all the doors). Well the door was shut but it was unlocked. We looked out the window and saw this shadow walk by. I opened the door and yelled ""anyone out there?"". No one answered. So I went back to the window and saw this person that was all white, like a ghost floating in the air. I called my dad and he came home and then he told me the story that a women had got hit by a car when she was walking her dog and now she hangs out around our shed.

After I found that out and my dad found out the story was true, we moved right away and they burnt down the house, no one would move there because of the lady that got hit by a car walks around the shed and house.

Spooky Encounters,United Kingdom,Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: Spooky Encounters

I know our house was bought from a widower, I'm not sure what happened to her husband, that might have something to do with these encounters. I often hear noises or feel a chill around me, I thought it must be my imagination until this.

One evening, my friend and her twin brother came around my house. Me and my friend chatted, my younger brother and her twin played pillow fights in the ecleves of my room. Then the boys came out of the door and said the light had gone out. The bulb was not there so we assumed they had knocked it out we could not find it so we got my mum. At first she could not see anything, so we emptied everything out, but nothing. Later when my friend had gone, I opened the door to the ecleves and low and behold, there was the bulb sitting right in front of me. No cracks no marks just like someone or something had gently unscrewed it...

Now on to melon's story, one day I found out that before we lived in our house someone died there. Now I know why I have had some encounters. Here is what happened... One day it was just me and my mom in our house, I was on my computer and I heard a bang upstairs. I thought nothing of it, but then I heard a bang downstairs (where I was). I asked my mom ""what was that?"" she said I'm not sure, but I then thought it must have been a ghost and I know that sounds weird, but seriously it was!

Now back to bannana. Another night when I was in bed I couldn't sleep, I don't why, it was like something was stopping me. After tossing and turning for what seemed like hours, I finally found a comfortable position, facing the wall, back to the door. I was nearly asleep when suddenly something poked me. Another time I was in the shower. Something knocked on the door, the handle went down like someone was trying to get in. My brother and dad were out and my mum was outside...

Now to Melon. One day I was in my dining room and I was sitting down on the sofa playing a game on the game cube. It was dark outside because this was at night. When all of a sudden, I see a ragged looking old tramp in the corner of my eye for like a second. I looked and it was gone but the strange thing was he was looking at me and he looked very scary and I don't really think it's my imagination because I have had some other encounters.

The last story is from bannana. The safest place in our house was the study, or so I thought. One night when my mum and dad were upstairs putting my brother to bed I was watching the TV. When the adverts came on I put the sound on mute. That's when I heard it tapping on the keyboard like someone was typing. I thought nothing of it until one day my dog went up to the leather chair (were my dad sits when he's working) he jumped on it and licked it, whining for attention, but none was sitting in it. Strange or what?

These stories are all true. If you have any ideas or thoughts please tell us we would appreciate it. Love, bannana and melon.

Hanging Barn,"Illinois, United States",Apparitions / Voices / Touches,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Apparitions / Voices / Touches :: Hanging Barn

T his happened to me about 3 to 4 years ago. My friend Andy and I were at an old abandoned barn taking pictures and video of the place, just because we were bored. It was probably 2 to 3 in the afternoon when we were there. Andy had decided to go into the barn to check it out and see what kind of pictures we could take inside. I stayed out side to set up the cameras on the tripods. I was getting a good focus measure when I saw a hawk fly over the same barn that Andy had just gone into. I followed it with the 35mm camera and right as it flew over the barn I noticed a figure standing on top of the roof of the barn (keep in mind I am seeing this through the camera lens.) I put the camera away from my face and looked up, and there was nothing there. I put the camera back up to my face and the figure was still there. I started to snap pictures as I called Andy to come outside the barn. He got out and I told him to grab the camcorder and start recording at he area where my camera was pointed. He did and we both watched through our respective lenses to see the figure step off the edge of the barn and we saw the shadow of a rope go taught and then nothing. We were pretty freaked so we went back to his place. We took the video off the camera and went to get the film developed. While we waited the hour it took we went to the public library and looked up the location of the barn. Apparently there was a girl who had hung herself from the roof of that barn in the 1910s. We looked at the picture of her and it was the same girl we had seen. Pretty creepy, what's more creepy is I have to go past that place everyday on my way to school and I still think about that as the hanging barn.

What the Shadow People Want,"Alaska, United States",Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: What the Shadow People Want

E veryone remembers my story about those shadow people at the end of my bed right? Well, I've been working up the nerve to turn off the lights and confront them for awhile now, and last night, I decided that it was time. I spent as much of the night watching TV as I could, trying not to talk myself out of what I was about to do. Around 11:00 pm I finally told myself that it was time and I trudged into my room. My blankets were turned down, though I didn't remember doing that myself earlier (I have a bad habit of not making my bed), but just shrugged it off as my imagination and flopped onto my back, staring at the ceiling. I hadn't even bothered turning on my light when I'd first walked in and the only light was a little sliver of yellow light that peeked from the edges of my blinds from our porch light.

I pulled the blankets to my chin and continued to stare, wide-eyed at the ceiling. I couldn't relax enough to close my eyes and I kept telling myself that they wouldn't come if they didn't think that I was asleep. I finally managed to slow my breathing a little and close my eyes halfway when, out of the corner of my eye, I spotted one of them. It was standing to my right next to my nightstand, where that one who always made the others leave me alone stood. I kind of started to panic, and tried to think of my inner peace. It's sort of this place I go to when I feel threatened or scared. The shadow didn't do anything but stand there and stare at me, I could feel eyes looking straight at my face.

I sighed and turned to my side as if I were just moving around in my sleep so I could get a better look at the shadow. I couldn't see through it, and it was really tall, but that was all I could manage to make out. I continued to stare back at it through a half open eye and asked the question loudly in my head, ""Who are you and what do you want?"".

At this point, the shadow disappeared and I got seriously angry since it had taken me so long to get the nerve to communicate with them and turn off the light, and the thing just disappears! I sat up and asked out loud, ""What are you afraid of? Me? Coward..."". which probably weren't the best words to use since it was provoking, and I didn't wasn't to provoke whatever the thing was. I was just so mad.

I should tell you now that I keep my door open about an inch usually so my cat can walk in and out, but I'd closed it this night. Well, the door handle turned and my door was thrown open. I expected my mom or brother to tell me to keep it down, but no one was there. I stared out into the dark dining room, and thought I saw several shadows walked past real quick. I don't know why, but I looked over at my VCR clock and saw that it was now 2 a.m.

Then, the scariest part (mostly because it took me by surprise), my stereo, which sits on a shelf opposite my bed, turned on and the song The Quiet Place by In Flames started blasting as loud as my speakers could go. Now, for those of you who don't know who In Flames is, they are a heavy metal band, and The Quiet Place is one of their heaviest songs. My stereo seemed to have turned on by itself because the remote was sitting on top of it and the CD that had the song on it, wasn't in the stereo, it was in its case when I went to bed that night. I know because I had taken it out of my stereo earlier that day when I'd been exercising.

Because my door was open, everyone in the house heard the music, and my mom stomped into my room just as I'd sprung out of bed, hands over my ears, to turn off the loud guitar and screaming lyrics. I turned it off and my mom chewed me out about the whole ""If you can't sleep and need your music, then keep the door closed and keep it low!"".

After that whole incident, I sat with my light on, wide awake, until about six this morning before I could manage to fall asleep.

The only thing about last night, or rather, early this morning, that upset me was the fact that the shadow didn't answer my questions.

Nanny's Visit,Canada,Family / Friends Visits,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Family / Friends Visits :: Nanny's Visit

I n 1976, my grandparents and two of their daughters bought a house in Nova Scotia (they had just moved from Newfoundland). The house was about 20-25 years old when it was bought, and is still standing today. I don't know any history of the house before my grandparents bought it.

In July of 1991, my grandmother passed away from a short battle with lung cancer. Before she died, I spent every day with her - we were very close. A few years after she passed, my parents and I moved into my grandparent's house, as my grandfather wanted to be able to spend more time with me. He turned the downstairs into an apartment and we moved in upstairs.

A year or two after we moved in, strange things started happening. A few instances, I remember. I was young at the time, between the ages of seven and nine. A few times, the channel on the T.V. Would change on its own when no one was handling the remote. One year on Thanksgiving, my dad's friend was spending the day with us. There was a wine glass sitting on the table in front of him that slid across the table without being pushed. My mother recalls seeing a white shadow moving around the hallway out of the corner of her eye. It would start out moving quickly and then when its presence was acknowledged, it would slow its pace.

One instance that sticks out in my mind happened in November of 1997. We had received some unfortunate news about my grandfather on my dad's side. He became very ill, and was in the hospital. His outcome did not look promising, my parents spent that whole week in the hospital with him. I was 10 years old at the time, and could not stay by myself. My mom's friend - we will call her Donna - stayed with me. One night, we came home from running some errands. Donna put the keys on the counter next to the door, as we had to run back out. We went about our business around the house, not paying any attention to the keys. When we were about to leave, we realized the keys were missing. Searching for them, we found them in my room. I had not touched the keys, as it is not like me to move something like that without telling someone.

A night or two later after everyone had fallen asleep, Donna woke up to a noise down the hall. Thinking I had got up to get a drink, she called out to me. No answer. Thinking she had been dreaming, she tried to go back to sleep. All of a sudden, she felt like she was being watched. Donna has had experiences with the paranormal before, so she knew something was there. She forced herself to open her eyes, and kept telling herself not to scream. What she saw next, chilled her to the bone. A spirit was standing over her, looking her in the face, and smiling. She closed her eyes quickly, and the spirit was gone.

The next morning, my grandfather died in his sleep. Donna talked to my mom about it, but wasn't sure if my mom had shared the same experiences. Mom assured her that she had, and that she believed it was the spirit of my grandmother coming to check on her 'favorite granddaughter'.

We have since moved from that house. Talking with my mom one morning, we agreed that we both believe that my grandmother's spirit has found its way back to us. Mom has seen movement out of the corner of her eye when nothing has been there, and I have felt a presence in the house when I've been alone. I believe she has found us somehow. Reunited again.

Baby Crying  and  Basement  Apartment,Puerto Rico,Misc,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Misc :: Baby Crying  and  Basement  Apartment

H ere's an experience told by my mom. Once, a friend of my mother told her, that a friend of hers, who moved to a basement apartment in New York had an awful experience. She had a child. When they moved to a basement apartment, as soon they stepped into their new home, the kid would cry and never stopped. When she got out the baby was fine, but when they went back, the kid would cry and cry. They didn't know why was this happening. They thought it was something in the air or paint that the baby was allergic to. So, they decided to move again, the mother and the baby had to sleep over a friends house, until they would find another place to live.

Well, they did find one. But his time, it seemed, it didn't work. The child would cry and cry again. Then she started thinking. Why is the baby still crying? She left the old basement apartment. What could it be? She saw she had taken with her a beautifully design contact paper that was in their previous apartment, which the last tenant left. The thing is, the last tenants practice what we called, ""La Obra"" ""The Work"", spiritism. They threw it away and problems were solved.

What else happened in this basement apartment? My Mom, Dad and friend went to visit her in her new place. Mom didn't want to take me. She told me that the lady stated that when she was there, the radio would turn on, and would hear many voices, not frequencies, as we hear normally. Many languages, and channels would change. She would hear voices, talking all at once.

Her husband said that after that event, she would sometimes be like in a trance form from time to time, then she is fine. I don't know more from them on.

What I would like to know is this, what is the use of spirits to have a person in a trance state of mind? I haven't figure that one out yet.

iPod Glow,"Michigan, United States",Misc,"M y best friend and I spent the night at her cousin's house one night. Her house is haunted by several ghosts. Although I never new that until a couple weeks before. There are three ghosts they seem to be very close with by the names of, Jimmy, Martha, and Reggie. I didn't know about them until when I got to her house. My friends told me that Reggie is the son of Jimmy and Martha, and Reggie killed his parents by setting their house on fire because he was mad at them. Even though a couple of years later Reggie drowned because he didn't know how to swim. This happened about two hundred years ago and my friends met them on vacation up north somewhere a few years ago.

At the sleep over they said only they can talk to the spirits because they have known them a lot longer and I can't. I didn't know if I believed the story and because of that they asked what the spirits think about me and Jimmy said I was mean. My friends had said I could ask questions and they could translate through to the spirits. We got so caught up in the excitement that we even asked if they could be guardian angels for us and the spirits said yes. So Reggie agreed to be mine and that he was nice again.

The next day I guess I was being ""followed"" by a ghost. But even later that night when I went to bed I woke about 3:00am or 4:00am and my iPod was in my CD player charging but it was glowing. I mean really glowing, the screen on it was white like when you push a button and it turns white, but the only thing I don't understand was that the hold button was on which means if you press a button it can't do anything because it is on hold and it is impossible to light up. This has happened at least three times and just happened once last night.

One time I could of sworn it lit up green like the battery picture in the corner. I told my friend and she asked Reggie and he said it was him just saying hi and that he was there if I needed him at all. What I really want to know is if that is him or if my friends really are lying and it is all one big joke just to scare me out of my socks? If he is real I would like to know who is he and why he chose us? Only if it isn't too much trouble. Please and thank you in advanced!

Whispering Blue Face,"Vermont, United States",Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: Whispering Blue Face

I 'm a psychic person, meaning I can see and feel the presence of dead people. My house can be silent at times and it also can be noisy. One day I was trading rooms with my now 16 year old sister, Steph. This room connects to the attic. I was fixing up my bed because it was totally late. I happened to look at the attic door for no apparent reason -I saw this for 2-3 seconds- there, in a black robe, was a 5 foot (at least) person that walked in front of the attic door. Later on, my grandmother was diagnosed with breast cancer... And soon died.

Last summer 2006, I was asleep and I suddenly woke up because my radio turned on and made a screechy noise and then the plug was pulled out and a running sound was heard. No one was awake. Soon after that: My uncle died of a seizure at 29.

One night I was asleep, and I couldn't wake up. I panicked. Then I calmed down, I could barely control my lips and I moved them to say F*** off! In a minute I could move. My sister's friend Bri is a psychic too. As soon as she set foot in my room, after I said ""Come meet Blue face!"", she said ""a man is sitting on your bed smiling peevishly. He looks maybe 16. Also he has black eyes and a bluish tan face... In other words he looks like he drowned...""

Later that month, I felt something or someone crawling up to me... I heard a whispering voice say my name ""SSSHHAARROOON!"" And I snapped fully awake panicking. I thought ""No! I must fight! This is MY room now!"" Then I looked over to the corner... And that's when I noticed I was psychic. There was Blue Face's whole body. I got up and RAN to my sister's room (Adrianne) and woke her up to tell her what happened. We both stayed awake for the rest of the night. Previously I have had the blank out again.

Also I am 207 pounds now and I am still am trying to lose weight. So I was putting signs up to prevent me from eating like a cow. Soon I had heard knocking -loud knocking- so I walked out to my sister's room and waited until it stopped. When I came back to finish my signs, knocks were heard again. All I said was SHUT UP! And it stopped.

The Man in the Park,Puerto Rico,Misc,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Misc :: The Man in the Park

O ne day, I was riding my bike through the park with my little brother and when I passed the bench, I saw a a strange man dressed in old rags and broken brown shoes. The weird thing about him was he called my name 3 times and then he disappeared! I was so scared that I ran all the way home and never went outside again without a friend or a parent!

After a month or so my mom asked me if I could get the mail for her since she had a broken leg. I said yes. As soon as I stepped out side I automatically saw the same man standing near my mail box! I was about to run but he screamed my name OVER AND OVER again in a hateful voice that made me cry so much! In seconds he was gone again! I ran inside as fast as I could and when I went inside I ran into my room gasping for breath! All of a sudden something was choking me in my own bed! I tried to scream for help but the last thing I saw was the man near my mail box and in the park!

When I woke up, I realized that I was in the hospital; the doctor told me that I was attacked but they didn't believe me when I told them my part of the story. Until this day, I never ever go outside for NOTHING! I am scared for life because of my terrible experience with the man in the park! I am now 14 years old, and I realized that the man in the park who had attacked me was the same man who killed and raped 13 years old teens about 2 years ago. He passed away on my birthday!

The Cat Coming to Visit,"Ohio, United States",Pets / Animals,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Pets / Animals :: The Cat Coming to Visit

H i again. I'm sure at least some of you remember my 115 year old Slave House Haunted story . Well, I got another one for you. The first one happened about a year after that story. My friend Paige's mom has had a cat, Belle, for almost 13 or 14 years (I don't know the exact date, all I know was that she was older than we were!) And for the longest time, she was a huge cat, no matter what the doctors did or anything. Finally, for the first time, an x-ray came up showing 3 tumors and lots of liquid surrounding the heart, and no doctor had ever seen it before then. It was in its advanced stages too, and according to my friend, they wouldn't have been able to help her even if they caught it in the very beginning.

So, my friend put her cat down. Ever day, she'd gone to sprinkle catnip on Belles grave in the backyard. I came over to stay the night 6 days later. Nothing happened all night, and the next day, we stopped at an adoption center to look at the kittens. After much debate between her parents and her, Paige finally decided: not to get a kitten, but to get a 4-year-old cat, which she named Isabelle. We called her Izzy for short. Izzy was still shy from being in the pound, so we let her explore and went back to Paige's room.

Paige and I had been talking earlier about the ghosts of cats; when I brought up Belle and the catnip, she said ""Crap, I forgot to do it! Aw well, she'll get over it"". And we went on as usual. Then comes the scary part. We were home alone for a few hours, and Paige was going to get in the shower. So, we sat talking and watching Danny Phantom on T.V. While she got the bathroom ready.

Now, the lights in the hallway were on, the light was on in the sitting room beside the front door, and the curtains were open, and the curtains and lights were on in Paige's room, too. It was still daylight out. As we sat there talking, the T.V. Suddenly went out for no reason. We waited and turned the cable box on and off and on again, and it came back on, so we kept talking. A few minutes later, the T.V. goes out again. Mind you, it was a perfect day outside, so we couldn't blame the wind!

Paige and I start to get nervous, and turn the cable box off again, then back on. It's fine for another minute, but soon after it goes out, comes back on, then goes out. I'm starting to get very annoyed, so I called out ""Stop!"" The T.V. came back on and stayed that way. Paige comes out in her bathrobe to ask something, and the T.V. goes out, but this time, the closet lights flicker and go out, too. Then the lights above the bed go out. Paige is starting to get my drift, and she shouts ""Stop it, Belle! Leave Tiffany alone!"" Everything comes back on, and stays on.

Paige gets in the shower and nothing happens. I turned on my Game Boy and was playing it, when a white streak passed in front of the T.V. I dropped the Game Boy and stared at the T.V. To see if it would come back. It didn't, so I uneasily sat back and started playing again. Then, the T.V. Goes out, and the lights flicker. By then I was scared silly, so I jumped up and ran into the bathroom.

When Paige got out of the shower, I stayed in the bathroom while she checked the room. When she gave the all-clear, I came back out. The T.V. goes out again, and Paige gets mad. She shouted ""Goodbye Belle! I said goodbye now! Is that what you wanted? Well, there's a new cat here, so I won't get lonely without you. Good-bye and good luck!"" The T.V. goes back on, and never goes out again.

That entire time, the lights in the hallway and in the rest of the house stayed normal. The T.V. in the living room was working fine, so it was only Paige's room that went all out of wack. I believe it was just Belle coming to say good-bye. Not long after that, another cat named Toby came up and tried to walk in like he owned the place. So now she has two cats, like I do.

This is a little thing that I don't think is related, but was a funny fact. When I saw Izzy trying to sneak under the bed in Paige's room, I had a sudden thought. The old cats name was Belle, and the new cat in town was Isabelle. See the similarity?

Gray  Light Shadows,Puerto Rico,Psychic / Medium,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Psychic / Medium :: Gray  Light Shadows

I was reading the story What Shadow People Want , it reminded me when as a child, when lived in an apartment in New York, on the first floor. Every night I would see shadows, but they were kind of gray in color, the room was dark, I had my eyes open and that is what I saw, gray shadows, like people figure, many walking in and out of my room through the door. They never looked nor bothered me. They just walk. Like as if passing by. I thought that was normal. We lived there for some years. It stopped when we moved to Coney Island.

That's another story. But, why was I seeing those gray figures? Demons or ghost passing by? I just saw them and had no answers because I was small. Then things got out of hand when I experienced more occurrences in our next living place.

This time I didn't see shadows, I saw true figures and felt strange forces, that scared the living lights out of me. As time passed I got curious and wanted answers .

Cry Baby Bridge,"Ohio, United States",Ghost Hunting,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Ghost Hunting :: Cry Baby Bridge

T his is for those who often wonder if some of the things experienced can ever be explained away. Almost everyone has heard the tell of ""Cry baby bridge"", heck almost every state and some cities has one. Well here is the story of the one that happened in my home town. Location will not be given to preserve the privacy of the people who live around the area. It is said that a young unmarried lady had given birth to her lovers child and when she presented the child to him, he turned them both away wanting nothing more to do with the mother or child. The young lady being distraught and not able to turn to her family for help, it was a time when it was considered shameful to have a baby out of wedlock. So she decided to jump from a bridge with her baby, they supposedly drown and were never seen again. They say that if you are on the bridge on moonless nights, you can hear the baby crying and see the mother as a white light walking up the shore line of the river searching for her baby.

I decided to investigate this story and see or hear for myself if this was a true haunting or if it was just another urban legend. A friend and myself arrived at the bridge around 11 pm and we sat and listened to the wind and the river, at first nothing and then we heard what did sound like a baby crying. We also saw what appeared to be a white light moving up the shore line and then disappearing at almost the same time as the baby stopped crying. We did a little further investigation and found the causes for both the light and the crying. The crying was the sound of peacocks from a nearby residents and the light was the reflection of headlights off a piece of metal near the river bank from car(s) on a nearby road. It would seem that the lights from the approaching cars would disturb the peacocks causing them to cry out, which while on the bridge would almost sound like a baby crying. Once the car(s) passed the peacocks would be quite and the white light would disappear.

Daughter Seeing Spirits,"Indiana, United States",Children Who See Spirits,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Children Who See Spirits :: Daughter Seeing Spirits

I am a single mom of a three year old daughter. I have suspected for a while that she sees ""things"". I have been to a couple of mediums that have also brought this subject up saying she does. We recently started staying with my grandma while our house is being built. My grandfather died in the house about 3 years ago. Strange things happen, loud crashes, I will start the dryer, come back and it will be off and the door opened, and where we sleep, someone constantly jerks the door handle at night. My grandma says this always happens and claims the noises are from squirrels on the roof. My daughter is having conversations with her toys and the other night I walked into the room as she was saying ""Leave Me Alone"", she was by herself I asked her who she was talking to and she said no one.

She speaks a lot of my dead uncle who died like 30 years ago in a car wreck. He was only 18. No one really ever told her anything about him but she talks about him a lot. One more strange thing happens in this house where neither one of us can sleep good. I have the most crazy vivid dreams and wake up all through the night. Every night I wake up at 4:00 a.m. Has anyone had an experience like this? Is there anyway to confirm she is seeing things? If she does see things why does she deny it? Am I crazy?

Trailer Park Ghosts,"Wisconsin, United States",Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: Trailer Park Ghosts

W hen I was 6 or 7, I lived in a trailer park in Sunnydale WI. It was a small trailer but that's all my parents could afford. It had a small kitchen and small living room and only three bedrooms. A hallway was connected to all three bedrooms. I had to share a bedroom with my sister. We shared a bed also.

One night when I was asleep, I woke up with my bedroom door open and when I looked out, there was a small girl outside my bedroom door. I thought it was my sister at first and was going to go tell her it was bedtime, when I accidentally bumped into my sister, I realized it was not my sister outside the door. I sat there staring at her and she stared at me. I screamed and the little girl disappeared. I woke up the whole house, my parents came into the room to see what was wrong, I told them that there was a little girl outside of my door. They did not believe me and told me it was just a dream. I believed them. I went back to sleep eventually.

Another time I saw a ghost is when I was in my parents room sleeping with my mom and sister. I was looking out in the hallway when a man materialized before my eyes and appeared to be floating forward, but he didn't move. I just stared hoping he would go away, I put my head in the pillows and then eventually fell asleep. I didn't tell anyone about that, afraid they would say it was another dream or seeing things.

The last time I saw a ghost was when my mom was in the room. A women was watering a plant. But there was no plant there, just a large piece of wood. I could almost see the plant. I told my mom to look by the piece of wood to amuse me, she did and she also saw the ghost. My mom freaked out and took me, my sister and my brother out of the house and went to a neighbors. She told my neighbors what happened and the neighbor lived their all of her life and told us that a couple of years ago, a stranger came to their house asking to use the phone and they let him. Then he pulled out a gun and shot everyone there and was going to use their house as a hideout because he was a convicted killer. They never found the bodies to the family that used to live their.

I think that's why they hung around. We moved ou immediately after words.

Old Haunted House,"Washington, United States",Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: Old Haunted House

W e moved into our 80+ years old house a little over 5 years ago. Our youngest son was 2. He refused to go in the bathroom alone. He said he saw ""black eyes"" in there. We brushed it aside thinking that he didn't want to be potty trained and/or he had a very active imagination. Not too long after we moved in, things would disappear from where we had just sat them down... hairbrushes, keys, cups of coffee etc. and reappear in another area.

We often felt like we were being watched. I would feel taps on my shoulder as I worked on the computer. My children would come to me and say ""what?"" because they thought I called them but I had not. One of my sons and I were in the kitchen talking as I did dishes. From across the room, a box of cereal flew from the top of the refrigerator, hit the window over the sink and fell into the sink. We just stared at each other without saying a word.

I began to see a large, dark figure going from the bathroom, into the hallway, and through the wall and back again. My husband doesn't believe in spirits, well, he didn't. But he saw it too. The kids began telling us that they saw a large black ""thing"" walking around the house. We had NOT told them what we had seen.

One night, a friend of mine came over and we were watching a ghost cam online. The lights were out in the computer room. All of our kids were over our shoulders looking at the cam with us. The lights turned on. Thinking it was one of my kids, I said, ""hey, turn them back off"" the lights went off. My friend said that she kind of liked them on actually, instantly the lights came back on. One of the kids said ""whooa, who did that?"". We turned around to see all of the kids right there with us nowhere near the light switch. I said, ""Well, I want the lights OFF"" and they turned off again.

One night, I was in my bed watching T.V. My husband was at work, my 2 youngest boys were asleep on the sofa's in the living room, my daughter was at a sleep over, and two of my older sons were watching T.V. In the living room. My son came in to ask me if I had heard anything. I laughed and said no, I asked him if he was watching a scary movie and got spooked. He said no, they were watching Family Guy (nothing spooky about that hehe). I told him he was being paranoid. He came back in a few minutes later and asked me to come into the living room. Ticked as I was, I went in and started working on a sewing project just so I could keep busy while waiting on them to feel more comfortable or fall asleep. Both boys looked frightened as they said ""Mom! Did you hear that?"". I had the sewing machine going so I hadn't heard anything. I sat and waited about five minutes. Nothing happened. I started sewing again and they stopped me again! I was really ticked by then. Frustrated, I began putting up my sewing project. I was stopped by a VERY loud thud from the second floor above me. The boys kept asking me if I had heard THAT. I blamed it on the cats. My son pointed to the two sleeping cats on the floor. Before I could come up with another logical explanation, it happened again. And again. And again. For about an hour we heard continuous sounds of banging, thuds, and the sound of furniture moving on the wood floors upstairs. We attempted to go up the stair way to see what was going on but we were honestly too afraid to go up the first step even.

Finally, the sounds stopped. The boys fell asleep, but I stayed awake until my husband came home at 6:00am. He asked me why I was up so early. I told him that I hadn't been asleep. I was hesitant to tell him what had happened since he really did not believe in hauntings or spirits despite having seen the dark figure before. He asked me what was wrong. I told him. He laughed and headed up the stairs. I was right behind him. He stopped before the last step. I looked around his shoulder and saw that our oldest son's room had been demolished. Boxsprings were off of their beds, the mattresses were leaning on the walls, the dresser was in the middle of their room with the TV on top of it, toys, books, papers and clothing were strewn all over their room. Without speaking, we cleaned the room.

I talked to a friend about it and she suggested that we use white sage to cleanse the house. I also did a lot of googling about hauntings. I took my digital camera upstairs in the dark and took pictures wherever I felt ""funny"" or cold. When I came downstairs, I also took a picture of my fireplace because I had always felt ""funny"" there. Nothing showed up on the L.E.D. Screen of my digital camera but I uploaded the pictures anyway. We saw orbs everywhere. In one area of the upstairs hallway it looked like a galaxy of sorts, hundreds of orbs all around. At the bottom of the stairs there was a red blob. The photo of the fireplace showed a white woman in what appeared to be a bathrobe of sorts and she was very bright white. Wanting to make sure that I didn't suggest to anyone what it looked like, I just showed friends and family the photo... Everyone said it was a woman.

We went and got some white sage and burned it all over the house, outside, inside, everywhere. Things calmed down. I was talking to a neighbor and she said that devil worshippers had rented our house before we moved in. She said very odd sounds came from the house and that after they had been evicted, the neighbor and her husband had come to visit the owners while they cleaned and were horrified to see demonic graffiti sprayed on all of the walls. I thought that explained it and was glad we had cleansed the house.

Within a couple of months, it started back again. My daughter yelled for us one night, we ran up there and her new television was flipping channels. I told her she was sitting on her remote. She pointed to her night stand, it was on her nightstand. I took the batteries out, the T.V. continued switching channels. The next day, our older boys yelled for us, we ran up to their room and were astonished to find that every channel was french speaking. We don't have satellite TV, just cable, we don't live in a french speaking area or normally have french speaking television channels. We turned off the television.

Our bath tub began running water while nobody was even in that part of the house, and our toilet would flush on its own. I had a self cleaning oven. You know when you slide the lever to lock the oven door to turn it on for the self cleaning how it makes a buzzing sound? While we were in the living room watching T.V. The buzzing sound began happening over and over. We walked into the kitchen to see the lever going back and forth very quickly and the digital clock/control was changing from numbers, to letters, to symbols at a furious rate. We stood there watching this in silence for almost 5 minutes. My kids looked terrified so I felt I had to take control somehow, I yelled in a very stern voice ""Knock it the f**k off!"". IMMEDIATELY it stopped and the oven door completely fell off onto the floor. I inspected the door, it looked as if the metal semi-circular hinges had been cut.

I tried to talk to the spirits. I don't know why, but I feel one is the elderly lady who had grown up here and inherited the house. I have no idea who the ""dark"" one is. I said that they could stay if that is what they wish to do but please don't frighten our family anymore. I said that they would be happier if they went to the other side. Thinking I felt a little foolish for talking to them, I stopped. I began feeling very depressed and sad. I felt like crying. At that point, I began a 3 month battle with deep depression. I just felt so hopeless and there was no real reason. My life is great, my family is great, there was just no real reason for my sadness. When we would leave, I felt much better. If we went away for a weekend I would be fine until we returned to the house. I love this house so it wasn't my living situation that was depressing me.

I am working through that, I seemed to ""get better"" after I acknowledged that maybe I was feeling sadness from the spirits. My kids have began seeing the dark thing again. Now it seems to like the area of our foyer and living room, kitchen, bath, hallway, and my daughter (who does NOT believe at ALL in spirits) said she saw it standing at the foot of her bed.

A lot of visitors to our home say they feel kind of freaked out. We don't tell people what goes on here so they don't have any preconceived ideas of a haunted house here. They just say that they feel frightened or as if something is watching them.My daughter's friend is spending the week with us, she said she felt a very cold spot in the living room. I felt it where she pointed it out. I brought a stool into the area and sat there. My back got cold. My son and the friend touched my back and it was ice cold, my face, hands, arms and legs were warm. She knew nothing about our issues here. She said that earlier when she had taken a bath she got creeped out and felt she was being watched. She hurried and rinsed the soap off and ran out of the bathroom. I asked her if she felt ""funny"" anywhere, she kept talking about the fireplace.

For the past 4 months, I have woken up with very deep burning scratches on my arms, legs, back and face. I have scars from some of them. They BURN. Usually they are in groups of three... Like this /// . Almost always, the middle one is the deepest. I do NOT have fingernails, and there is nothing in my bedding that would cause scratches. It's not our cats either. We don't have the cats anymore. We have a dog, but she sleeps in my son's room. Sometimes she stops suddenly and growls at ""nothing"".

I don't know if I am being singled out because I did the sage so it hates me now, or if it is ticked because I am not afraid of it, I don't know why I am the one scratched up. I am leery of trying the sage again because I don't want to piss it off again or provoke it to do more. My mom wants us to move out of here. I don't know if it would follow us or not. For now, we are just dealing with it.

True Encounters at Work,Malaysia,Apparitions / Voices / Touches,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Apparitions / Voices / Touches :: True Encounters at Work

I 'm one of the true believer in paranormals. 2 months back, after reading a ghost story from this web site, I went down to the ladies room. My office's (connected with factory) ladies is located just outside of the office building. We have to walk down and there is main door and small door inside. We have to lock the main door (to avoid any naughty passer by to open the main door as it's located in walkways) and there is another door inside... As usual, I went in... I locked the outside door and I locked main door. I sat down and just few second passed, when, suddenly, a shadow appeared and moved very fast across my inside bathroom door. It moved very very fast. I was extremely shaken. I sat in shock and thinking what was the thing might be (it's not my imagination).

My mind couldn't focus on the ""business"" I am doing. I just pulled-out my pant and I ran as fast as I can out of the ladies. I went back to work and pretended like nothing happened. But my heart was beating like hell. I didn't tell anyone. I don't want to scare the other workers where most of them are cheerful girls.

My company fixed 20 surveillance cameras around the building. Our security guard used to experience a floating figure at the main gate. This floating figures only appeared around 11pm-12pm at night and also captured on their surveilance cameras. I interviewed one of them, they agreed that this office is haunted by a few ghost.

My office is 50 years old. It's located near the railway tracks (many suicides in that tracks). In front of my office there is a bridge which connected to the main road (also used to have accidental spots).

You can experience more if you work late, you can experience like someone walking behind you. Many times there is a feeling like someone is following you from behind. You will find nothing when you turned back. It's like you are being watched. I always dismissed this kind of feeling just to make me free from fear. It fails most of the time.

Dear friends, I am a honest person. These are true encounters. I don't tell lies or make fun out of it. I have more experiences and will share when I got time... Now am working... See ya

Sleep Paralysis and Out of Body Experiences,United Kingdom,Misc,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Misc :: Sleep Paralysis and Out of Body Experiences

M y name is Jack and I'm nineteen years old. I first had one of my dreams about a year ago, I can't remember exactly what happened but I know that I couldn't move and there was a disorientating continuous buzzing down the side of my bed which I could not turn to look at because I couldn't move, I struggled, I was petrified, I thought I was dying. After this first one, I told no one because I thought that there was some kind of demon that came to menace me, or was it just sleep paralysis?

After this experience I never wanted it to happen again... But it did, over and over about twice maybe three times a month. After about the seventh time I started recording what was happening during these dreams, I still didn't like them but I was curious and intrigued because I didn't understand, so these are some of my recording:

I fall to sleep in bed in a strange way, I slowly feel my body and brain start buzzing with intent like an angry swarm of bees in my head and mouth, at that moment I am paralyzed. This is how it usually starts. One time, I was in this state, laying on my back, my eyes could move but my body would not, I was desperately trying to move whilst an extremely loud buzzing noise was to the left side of me coming from under my head under my bed, it started moving towards the end of my bed, still out of sight, I was so scared, eventually it was at the foot of my bed when it paused and got louder. I thought it would crawl up near my feet like in one of those dodgy horror movies, when it stopped, there was silence for a few moments, then suddenly a black shadow in the shape of a man, a ninja type being, leapt from the foot of my bed and perched on an invisible shelf on my sealing. I was waiting for it to pounce down on me or see some red eyes light up but it didn't, at this point I thought to struggle whilst I still had time.

The buzzing noise came back from the figure as I struggled trying to roll from left to write, eventually, the strangest thing happened, I rolled out of my bed to the left only to hit the floor and bounce back straight into bed. Confused, I carried on struggling rolling to my right, I started rolling through the wall down a spiraling slope, there were bright colors, it was like one of them portals going into another dimension or a time zone tunnel, it was sloped at 45 degrees and I was rolling continuously south. I thought I was going to roll straight into hell, so with a mighty surge of power and shouting I broke free, as I was trying to sit up, I felt like I was being pulled back by an invisible force. I could tell my eyes were still shut because it was still the same situation.

Eventually, I opened my eyes and woke completely, I turned and sat at the side of my bed with my head in my hands wondering what in gods name had just gone on. I was also wondering if I had woken up anyone else with my apparent screaming, as I decided to go back to sleep, I felt it starting again, I quickly opened my eyes to stop it from manifesting. I went to the toilet to try and make myself fully awake. It worked and I was cautious about going back to sleep but I did.

Since that ordeal I have had many different occurrences in my sleep paralysis, countless episodes of strange imaginary situations that have seemed to act out in real life, in fact I had one last night, but nowadays I just let it manifest and see what happens, it is usually a wonderful experience after you have just let it be.

Yesterday's one was brilliant, the scary introduction was as awesome as ever and the highlight was even better. I was levitated by a strange force up in the air with my covers still on me, I thought I was going to get chucked into the ceiling but I didn't struggle and I was suspended at least six foot above my bed in a horizontal position, I was slowly strafed to the right over the floor, I could have been dropped but instead I was lowered to the floor where I was left momentarily and then took back to my bed the same way it started, overwhelmed by this experience. I tried to wake up and did, again it is sometime a struggle to fully break free from the clutches of whatever is occupying me, but with trust, I think you can have the most bizarre experiences.

I feel if let manifest, sleep paralysis is a force out of this world helping you have these wondrous out of body, in body maybe experiences. Maybe it is a part of our brain that is working that we do not know about, apparently we only use a small percentage of our brain, whatever the explanation, I don't know...

Feel free to leave a message or email me at pureparkourpracticioner [at] hotmail [dot] co [dot] uk

I am always keen to share and learn from other peoples experiences.

My Cat Sees Them,"Virginia, United States",Apparitions / Voices / Touches,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Apparitions / Voices / Touches :: My Cat Sees Them

E ver since I saved this cat... I have seen ghosts. The cat's name is Kelly. The first weird thing happened when she sits and relaxes. She always focuses on the kitchen. My other cat doesn't but she does. She stares at it for hours, watching something. My mom says that she's looking at the window shadow as the wind blows the wind chimes. But every time I look I don't see any shadow or movement. I noticed, too, that she walks in this one pattern. Like she's following something. And the strange thing is when I follow her the temperature seems colder. But she's not the only one seeing ghosts.

One day I was sitting in the living room, watching television. I got up for a drink and noticed a child head move out side my window. I walked to the window and no one was there. Strange, I thought. Also ,at night time, you can hear creaks on the floor. Like someone was running through the hall. In the house and outside you can see black figures. And they're not the ones who appear in the corner of your eyes. They show up in front of you in a flash.

The Experience,"Illinois, United States",Psychic / Medium,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Psychic / Medium :: The Experience

I started seeing shadows at 4 years old, and at 9 years old it progressed to people. I was 8 years old when my 6 years old cousin died and by age 10 years old he came to me. Physically walking towards me, and I tried to wake my older cousin so she could see him, but only I was able to and she didn't believe me.

I lived in a apartment with my grandparents on the South Side of Chicago and every night around 1am or 2am the clock starts ticking very loudly and they start coming out. I slept on the couch and they would be right in front of me. It would be women in white dresses, different men either walking towards me or hopping side to side in front of me. I would jump in the bed with my grandmother every night until she started locking the door. The next step was putting my head under the cover until I fell asleep. No one ever believed me as a child.

I am now a 28 years old mother of one 8 years old son whose now seeing things, but he says he looks in my bedroom sometimes and see 3 people in white masks walking around in my room. Also, he sees the darkness. I stop experiencing these things for a long time but they're back.

A couple of weeks ago I was home alone and I woke up to cigarette smoke, but no one in my house smokes and I knew what it was so I said a prayer and it went away. I see darkness, sometimes I just say a prayer and it leaves. The reason I'm saying something now is because I had an experience around 7am this morning. I woke up to someone tapping me on the top of me head. First I thought it was my husband, so I looked up and said I'm still sleepy, laid my head back down and someone tapped my head again so I looked up and turned over to him and he was sound a sleep with his hands under the cover. I have no idea what's wrong with me and now my son.

Please comment on my message with advices or feedback. Thank you.

The Little Girl and the Three Men,Canada,Apparitions / Voices / Touches,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Apparitions / Voices / Touches :: The Little Girl and the Three Men

H i my name is Kim and I'm from New Sudbury. I am a young girl being haunted by more then one ghost, but this one little girl is still trying to contact me. When I first started living in this house, I have noticed an uncomfortable feeling in the room upstairs as well in the bathroom, like being watched...

A few weeks later it had gotten a lot stronger and I was able to see flashes of this little girl that had a pale white face, black long hair and black around its eyes with big pupils and about 5 or 6 years of age, maybe younger... A few days after I was in the bedroom laying on the bed alone and all of a sudden, the bed started to vibrate and shake for a few minutes straight, I had gotten up instantly shocked and ran out the bedroom.

I had told my boyfriend and he didn't believe my story. A week had gone by, me and my boyfriend were laying on the bed making love and I saw a little girl's face right beside me as I through him off. A few months later I was still feeling bothered, I just didn't say anything because I didn't want them to think I'm going crazy. A few months later I had made love to my boyfriend and afterwards I had noticed a bite mark from a little girl, like three little teeth marks. I asked my boyfriend ""did you bite me?"" and he said ""no, how could I?"" and I hadn't bit my own wrist. I had written a number on my wrist before I went to bed to remember a channel on TV for my show 615 and the teeth marks were under the six. We also noticed the clock needle was set at 3:00 am. We took pictures of the room, the mirror and the closets as well the basement and put them on the computer and saw the little girl's face in the bedroom and the basement, we saw two men in the mirror as well, a heart engraved in the basement wall with children's faces but when you look at it in person, it doesn't show, it only shows in the picture.

There was more but I would appreciate messages from someone who has already been through this and who can help me understand.

The Voice in my Daughter's Room,Puerto Rico,Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: The Voice in my Daughter's Room

I was going to sew in my daughter's bedroom where I had my sewing machine and to finish a dress I was making. Suddenly, as I walked in the room atmosphere changed. I felt like the inside a close closet where there is no air. I felt the air of the room was being sucked out. Then I heard a voice saying: ""Hello"", a male's voice. Just a plain ""Hello"". I just got so mad, because I didn't have time for this. I screamed ""Get out of here!"". Well, it did. The room kind of opened. Felt the air of the room. I continue with my sewing and never bothered.

But, sometimes when I went into that room, I smelled the smoke of tobacco. Awful! Then it disappeared. Here I knew, something wanted to bother me. Just to bother me. Who or what was it? Just some spirit wanting something to be entertaining. I asked the owner of this rented house if someone died in this house. She said her father. I asked her if he smoke. She said, ""Yes, tobacco"".

That did for me. I told my husband I wanted to move. Nothing happened in a few month and I was not waiting for it to happened. Then we finally moved.

My Daughter's Crib,"California, United States",Family / Friends Visits,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Family / Friends Visits :: My Daughter's Crib

I was getting ready to settle down in my bed after putting my first born daughter in her crib in the next room... A few moments later I heard ""Oh look, a baby"" in a male's voice, coming from my infant's room over the baby monitor. But my husband was laying next to me, my father and mother were already asleep in their own bed, 2 rooms down, my grandparents (mother's side) were in the mother-in-law quarters (which were down the hill driveway) and were already asleep. I think it was my late grandparents, or grandpa (father's side) who had passed away a year ago, coming to wish the baby a welcome. Either way, I sprung out of bed and grabbed my baby. She slept in her bassinet next to my bed or in my bed for quite a while after that!

Now, I had in the past seen my father's mother before, watching me sleep or play piano, but for them to come to my child kind of freaked me out. I know they would never hurt her, but the thought that it could've been something else with a vulnerable infant is what kept me from putting her back in her crib. Freaky.

Even as I write this someone/thing is playing with my hair, like running a single finger through my hair or just stroking it lightly... It's rather annoying.

My Haunted Apartment Used To Be a Funeral Home,"West Virginia, United States",Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: My Haunted Apartment Used To Be a Funeral Home

Y ears ago, we lived in an old building that at one time was a funeral home. It was not uncommon to hear strange noises and things at all times of the day. The first summer we were there, my daughter was just a baby. I had just laid her down for a nap and laid down on the couch for a quick nap, after just a few minutes I heard a man's voice calling my name. I got up and looked around and saw no one. Laying down, I heard him calling my name again, but this time, louder and more demanding. I got up and went to look in my daughter's room. She had pulled the blankets up over her head and couldn't breath. I firmly believe that it was the man, who had shot himself in the basement years before, warning me about my daughter. To this day there are still caskets and vaults down stairs. They also still have the embalming table that was used for the funeral hone. My daughter also says that she would see people walking passed her door every night dressed in period clothes. This continued until we moved out after 8 years.

There Are Others in my House III,Puerto Rico,Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: There Are Others in my House III

T here were many times I felt so at peace in this house , I loved this house, But then it kind of change. We moved in April of 2005 and moved out in August 2005. There were times, when alone in this house, I would hear children crying. Two it seemed. But it was not frequently. I followed these cries and always lead me to the corner of my husband side of the bed bedroom wall. Where I hear the tapings on the wall. Eerie! Going to other rooms of the house was different. It was very tranquil. But going back and hear it again in my room, which was always cool, I felt chills. Anyway, I always felt something happened in this house or previous house made in this foundation. I felt so uncomfortable and desperate hearing these cries, wanting to do something and help these kids. But what! And at the same time I didn't want to. I didn't know what was I facing! My husband never heard them in the beginning, but then he did.

When my daughter was in the hospital for the third time when living here (warned to me by the child ghost and pointing to her room during the night), my husband went back to the house alone. He already parked his car inside the garage, walked into the house, and heard the cries. He couldn't figure where it was coming from, he thoughtit  must be some neighbors kids, but the cries seemed to be coming from inside the house, far cries, but inside the house. He followed the sound, and yes, just as I stated, it came from the corner wall. The next day, when he told me, he was shivering scared in the hospital. He couldn't sleep all night, he had head pressure. My kid stayed in the hospital almost a week. During this week, strange occurrences, for example, while in the hospital, a person went by and asked if the abandoned house next to ours was for sell, which, by the way, are the owners of the house we lived, My husband told him no. The owners told use they were never going to sell that house. Why? Beats me. It has been abandoned for years. Anyways, this person told my husband he is an medium, this place attracted him, even gave him a card. Well, the strangest thing with this man is that he came by again the next evening, while my husband was reading the newspaper in the balcony. We told him the new situation of the island and to be prepared. Actually, it was a warning, it is 2007, he predicted people are leaving the island because of politic changes, heaven knows a revolution will occurred. He told my husband to get passports. That freaked me out because we were thinking about this prior to this man visit. I always state one thing lead or have to do with the other.

I still saw the little girl, just seeing her staring at me and what I was doing. That never bothered me. But I felt scared at times. I never paid mind to it. Once, while I cleaned the kitchen after breakfast, I left a clean pot and a fork next to it, on the stove, to put away for later. When stepping out of the kitchen, I heard the sound of the fork hitting the pot once. I went back and saw it just as I left it. But I knew what I heard, because I hit it to hear if it was the same sound I heard. It was! I said ""So you like cream oatmeal?"" Because that's the pot I always made oatmeal. I sensed what she wanted.

I told my husband. He was speechless, he just looked surprised. At that same moment, he told me he saw a dark shadow going into our room while he was finishing his breakfast in the dining room area. I went to see if I saw something. I saw nothing. I felt the room was very cool though. I asked him to describe the shadow figure, he said it was transparent dark, thin and seemed not so tall, it just walked into our room. I asked him if the shadow made a gesture as if looking at him. He said ""no, just passing through"".

We finally agreed we had to move. Our relationship was going from bad to worse. In those few days, I told my husband I was going to move with my eldest daughter apartment above hers. I already talked to the owner of the house and the movers. I was set. He was to go on his own way. My daughters were never bothered with these spirits. Glad on that! Just my husband and I. The next day, he went out with one of his eldest son, and told him he didn't want to lose me, his son told him there was a house for rent right next to him. He came home and told me. I felt so great, I didn't want to lose him. For I do love him.

Moving day came. While my eldest daughter was helping me to move, she called my name. I shouted ""What?"". When I went to her, she opened her eyes wide opened, scared! Seeing her expression, I asked what was wrong, but I figured she must have seen something. I asked her then ""What did you see?"", She was surprise with my question. She said ""I heard you said 'What', but I figured you were in the other room"". ""What do you mean"", I asked. ""I saw you or a figure going to the other room, when I called you, you answered somewhere else"". ""What did you see?"" I asked. ""Just a dark figure, passing by"", she said. I was wearing black pant and a black t-shirt, that is why she thought she saw me. But it was not me. She saw the shadow figure. She got so scared and stayed outside. Not wanting to go into that house ever again.

We finished moving the rest of the furniture and boxes, now we were ready to clean up the house. When I opened the door to go in, I felt like something was going to happened. A very unpleasant feeling. I told the kids to stay outside. I will call them in case I needed them, but to stay outside more than inside. Well, I just wanted to get this over. I cleaned the house and I was very serious all the way. Yes, I still heard those tapings.

I saw the girl from time to time, while cleaning, just staring, and head down, and the lady at other parts of the house, just looked at me, kind of, well, like a bit mad, or that is how she looked, but said nothing. When all was cleared and cleaned, I felt the peacefulness of the house as the day I moved in. Then I realized that was how they lure tenants to live in and then scare the living daylight out of them.

When I moved to the new place, I felt we made a good choice, all is fine and peaceful. That's the end of ""There are Others in my House"" series. Finally.

The Man in the Window,"Colorado, United States",Apparitions / Voices / Touches,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Apparitions / Voices / Touches :: The Man in the Window

N ow, some people call me a liar. Others tell me that I was too young to know what I saw. I wasn't. To me, a 9 year old kid doesn't make up something this big. It all started one day in our hotel. I live in Illinois, but I was staying at a hotel with my parents in Colorado. The hotel was very new; not even a year old. After dinner, my parents and grandparents went with me downstairs to the pool. My grandparents and my dad watched me swim while my mom went outside to soak in the hot tub.

This pool was your average indoor pool, except the walls were different. They were almost like clear plastic, except they were windows, so you were able to see outside. It was really late out, so it was pitch black when you tried to look out. You could only see a dim reflection of the pool and the chairs.

A little while later, my dad left with my grandparents to go back to their house. My grandparents went upstairs, while my dad went outside to get my mom. I got out of the pool while they were gone and looked at my reflection in the glass. I saw myself, but then I saw something else. I squinted and looked in closer. I saw a man!

Now this is where I started to reconsider my sanity. I blinked and looked around. I was completely alone. I looked at a different window to make sure that I wasn't seeing someone else that was outside. I couldn't see anything. I looked back at the window. I saw myself, and then as I looked deeper, I saw the man. He was smaller than a regular sized person, like he was far away. The man seemed almost like he was transparent, and was in the air. Then I started to feel really cold.

His shoes were black, and he was wearing black trousers. He had a white shirt, like one of those man blouses from way back when. He also wore a black tailcoat and was wearing a top hat. He looked like he was around 40 or so. He was walking slowly, and his head was down. I continued staring. Then he looked at me.

Just then my mom opened the back door. I jumped. ""Michelle, are you OK?"" she asked. I didn't tell her what I saw. No one in my family believes in ghosts, and neither do I. It really freaked me out, though. I asked her if anyone was outside. She said she was the only one out there. I tried to push it out of my mind, but I couldn't. A little while later, I looked again. He was still there. I jumped into the pool and tried not to think about it.

Eventually, my mom and I left. As we did, the fire alarm went off. We went upstairs to find out that it was a false alarm, but no one had pulled the alarm. They didn't know how it happened. It really freaked me out. For the rest of the night, I had a weird feeling. It was like someone was watching me, but not in a bad way.

I don't believe in the paranormal, but I have a feeling. If it was a ghost, maybe the hotel was new because it was rebuilt. Maybe a long time ago, there was a hotel in that spot. It burned down, and many people died. That ghost that I saw could have been a man who died in the fire who came back to keep the same tragedy from happening again. Do you think so? Tell me what you think it was.

Recurring Dreams and Whispers,United Kingdom,Misc,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Misc :: Recurring Dreams and Whispers

I once kept having dreams and it felt like someone was in my mind. I know it sounds weird and fake, but I swear it's real. It started with a freaky dream where I went to go and get some custard cream biscuits from the shop. I took the bus home and while I was on the bus, a girl with blonde hair stared at me for a while and then bit my head off. I had that dream 5 times in a row. My next dream was when a murderer was coming to get me. He nearly shot me and it felt real, in the dream I hid in this cubical thing. I had that dream 6 times in a row. My next dream was when I was in school, this wolf with clothes was going to eat us all up. I hid behind a cupboard. I had that dream 7 times in a row. Do any of them dreams make sense to you? I have a lucky dream catcher now placed by my bed as a luck charm. In my last dream there was these monster things that I had seen in a book, they where on the wall laughing at me. I had that dream 8 times in a row. I am not kidding.

Now, sometimes I get whisperers in my head saying ""it is coming"". I really don't get what that thing is. I told my mum and she didn't care. It's like I've got a curse and it's freaky. It stopped when I was 8. I still don't get it. Nobody believes me... I wish someone would understand me and believe me, but nobody does.

The Figure in the Rearview Mirror,"Wisconsin, United States",Apparitions / Voices / Touches,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Apparitions / Voices / Touches :: The Figure in the Rearview Mirror

T his is my brother's story. Last October, my brother took Rocky, his dog, up North to visit our relatives. It was getting close to midnight when he came home and it was real dark. The entire time Rocky was quiet and he was resting in the backseat.

It was getting dark when they were on the road back home. My brother had his radio on and tried to keep himself awake. He got close to a small town called Westfield, which is a very popular rest stop. It looks Western-like. He noticed there were no other cars out except his. If you know this area, you'll also know that there's a cemetery on the other side of the rest area.

Everything around him was real dark, except his head lights of course. All of a sudden, he felt goose bumps on his arm and it went to the back of his neck where he felt the little hair stand up. Rocky started growling and he barked uncontrollably. My brother yelled at him to knock it off, because it scared him a little. Rocky quieted down but he was still growling. My brother adjusted his mirror to look at the backseat to see if Rocky's okay. He noticed a figure sitting in the back seat. So he rubbed his eyes and looked again. The figure was still sitting there and Rocky was growling at it, he was showing his teeth at the figure.

The figure, as my brother described it, was darker than all of its surroundings. When he glanced at the figure, he almost thought it was our 10-year old niece.

Footsteps of my Grandpa,Philippines,Family / Friends Visits,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Family / Friends Visits :: Footsteps of my Grandpa

I was not born yet when my grandfather died. His death anniversary is always celebrated and all of us gather at my grandmother's house to have a small party and sleep overnight there together with my cousins, uncles and aunties. My grandmother died year 1998.

But on his death anniversary, last 2003, we weren't able to celebrate it because of the reason that my auntie, the financier of the party, is somewhere else already so we decided we'll just visit my grandfather's grave and light a candle.

After our visit, I and my cousins went directly to my grandmother's house to watch a movie and have some snacks. I was 19 at that time and I was with my younger cousins. I felt sleepy while watching the movie and decided to sleep on one of the rooms at the house. I woke up suddenly and my cousins in the living room are shouting and was calling my name.

I went out of the room and my cousins were crying already and they told me that they heard footsteps going back and forth upstairs. We were sure no one was there because all of us were gathered in the living room to watch the movie.

I sat trying to pacify them and suddenly the footsteps were heard again. The floor upstairs is made of wood so we can clearly hear the noise coming from there. My cousins were screaming and it was becoming louder and louder like it was stomping its feet angrily. I freaked out, we all ran outside the house. We went home and I told my mom about what happened. She told us that it could be our grandfather trying to let us feel his presence. Mom told us he used to stomp his feet on the floor before to let everyone know he has arrived from work.

After that, whenever we're in my grandmother's house and we hear footsteps, we aren't afraid anymore. We just greet him and say ""Hi there, Lolo"" (nickname of endearment for grandfather in the Phils).

Phantom of Fanfiction,"Texas, United States",Apparitions / Voices / Touches,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Apparitions / Voices / Touches :: Phantom of Fanfiction

O ne night, I was up reading Fanfiction of Danny Phantom. Eventually, dawn came, but I still continued to read. Out of the corner of my eye, I saw some movement. I brushed it off as nothing, but it continued to persist. When I finally did look, the glass door cabinet, the one on the TV stands, had someone in it. I was seriously spooked.

But being me, I could've just over reacted. Either way, I thought I saw a man dressed in what looked liked winter clothing. That's a bit unnatural considering it was summer vacation. Well, I hightailed out of the computer room and ran to the room I shared with my little sister.

I climbed into bed and tried to sleep, but I couldn't. Usually, I tend to stay up really late if I encountered something on the internet I developed a fear for. Resident Evil, The Clock Tower, and Dead Rising were to name a few. I keep imagining something from those universes would come and attack me. So, I could've just been a little crazy. That could be supported by my friends, who think I'm way too hyper and aggressive.

Yet still, I could've sworn I saw the winter clothed ghost move. It seemed to adjust the hat or scarf it was wearing. Maybe it was the dawn light shining past the trees that caused the apparition to appear? Who knows? Fortunately, for my mental health, I never saw it again.

Not like I want to see it again... I'm already scared of the Pokemon glitch, MISSINGNO.

It Ruled the House,Australia,Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: It Ruled the House

A s a young boy my family and I traveled frequently from Australia to New Zealand due to our Father's work commitments. One of the homes we rented was in Remuera, Auckland. At least six months into the lease, there was increased tension with my parents... Fighting constantly. One night the three of us kids were home alone playing hide and seek when we heard our parents knocking at the front door. My sister went to open the door but she couldn't. Some force was preventing him to enter. Dad thought we were tricking him and began screaming at us, threatening punishment. Hysterically Mum put her hand on the handle and the door opened instantly. From then on a long series of weekly events happened. Flowers pots turned upside down, objects disappeared, light switches turned on and off and more scarily fresh cuts would mysteriously appear on dad's forehead.

We ended the lease before it destroyed the family. I'm sure ""IT"" had followed us over the years as too many other unexplained things have happened.

The Beautiful Unknown Voice,"Texas, United States",Apparitions / Voices / Touches,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Apparitions / Voices / Touches :: The Beautiful Unknown Voice

W hen I was around 6 or 7, me and my family were up in Texas visiting our relatives. We were staying with at our grandparent's house during our visit with them. We would all stay in my grandma's room because she had a huge king-sized bed. I was the one who slept next to the window and well, at that time, I wasn't scared to sleep next to the window.

I was laying there waiting to fall asleep. I fell asleep eventually and then I was awoken by a unfamiliar voice. The voice was calling my middle name which was odd because no one really called me by my middle name at that time. The voice sounded like a young woman. Her voice sounded so gentle and heartwarming that to this day I cannot even forget her lovely voice. She was saying my name like if it was a lullaby.

I got up from the bed and walked over to where I thought the voice was coming from. The voice was leading me to the a mirror my grandma had in her room. I looked in the mirror and I saw a young girl standing there looking back at me. She was so beautiful. She had a white sparkling dress and beautiful brown hair. When I first saw her I got scared and I ran back to the bed and, as I jumped on the bed, I felt something scratch my elbow and I realized that it was a nail that was poking out of the windowsill.

I woke my mom up and told her about the young girl. She just told me that there was nothing to be scared of cause it was all all a dream. So I just listened to my wise mother and went back to sleep. The next day I woke up and noticed that everyone had already woken up and was already in the kitchen eating breakfast. I got out of the bed and walked to the mirror again. When I looked in the mirror, I remembered about my elbow being scratched with the nail. I looked down at my elbow and there it was, the scratch from the night before. Till this day, I still remember the girl and this story, but I kind of kept the story to myself, now afraid that no one would believe me.

But I know what I saw that night and I will never forget that beautiful lady.

Norma's House,"Minnesota, United States",Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: Norma's House

M y cousin, Norma, and her husband just moved into their first home. I went over to help them unpack and clean up. The very first time I set foot into that place, I felt uncomfortable like all eyes staring at me. I told my cousin about this, she said I would feel better once they have unloaded the boxes and make the house feel cozier. She did say, ""It's just a little empty in here that's all."" I ignored that feeling and tried not to think about it. Several weeks went by, Norma called asking for my mom. After my mom got off the phone, mom said there had been an accident at Norma's and we had to go there right away.

When we got to Norma's, inside of her house was pitch black. I was very concerned when I didn't see their car in the driveway. My mom banged on the door, no one came to open. It wasn't like we lived far from her either - it's only a 10-minute drive. So mom and I went back home.

The next morning, mom called Norma. A woman's voice answered. My mom asked if this was Norma's house and if Norma was home. The woman said she's been living there for 15 years and asked if this was a joke. She also said there was no one by the name of Norma that lived in the house. My mom checked the telephone number again, it was indeed Norma's number. So I tried calling the same number, no one picked up. I tried a third time - the same woman picked up and said I got the wrong number.

A week later I ran into Norma at the supermarket. I asked if her mother in law moved in because whenever I called an old lady kept answering. Norma turned white in the face. She said she left to live with her mother in law about 2 weeks ago because her house was haunted. She told me about seeing an old lady walking around their house, whispering to herself then disappearing when Norma screamed.

She also said late at night, she'll hear the dishes banging or the water running as if someone was taking a shower. No one else lived there except her and her husband.

Norma hired movers to get her things out of the house and they live elsewhere but every time I drive pass that place, I get chills. Last I heard was that another couple moved in, then out right away and no one lived there since but some nights I'll see a light in the attic on when I drive pass.

The Three Westerns,"Virginia, United States",Apparitions / Voices / Touches,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Apparitions / Voices / Touches :: The Three Westerns

O ne day while me and my mom were at the store, my step dad saw one of the weirdest things: The Three Westerns. He was outside sawing something when my dog started raising Cain over something. So my step dad turned off the saw and looked over where my dog was barking. He saw nothing. So he went back to work and a few minutes later my dog started up again. This time when my step dad looked, he saw three men standing by the fence. The men wore long over coats like in the civil war and wore hats. My step dad rubbed his and looked again and they were GONE.

So when we came home from the store he told us all about his great adventure. Ever since, I have been very careful. This was in a case of feeling like someone is watching you. My step dad has seen many unbelievable thing but he said this was the best.

We found out the next day that someone we knew died and that made all of us feel weird. To this day we believe that the three men fought and died in the civil war right here, on the very land my house is sitting on.

The Glass of Water,"Illinois, United States",Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: The Glass of Water

T his happened to my family when I was about 1 or 2 years old; I am now 15. My mother and I were living with her mother who lived in an old house with a troubling history. Around the late 1950's a man went insane and murdered his family which consisted of a wife, 2 sons and and a young daughter. Their bodies were found in a small shut-off cellar that my grandma has in her basement.

My mother and I left for a doctor's visit, but my mother didn't tell my grandma that we were leaving. My grandma was doing laundry in the basement when we left and on her way up the stairs she saw a little girl around my age so she assumed it was me. 'I' was sitting on the top stair and asked my grandma for a glass of water. My grandma got the water and was walking back towards the basement door to give 'me' the cup when the doorbell rang. My grandma went to answer the door and as she did, she put the water on the dining room table. It was my mom and me at the door, my mom had forgotten something so we had to go back. Startled, my grandma asked how could my mother had me the entire time when I was just in the basement with her. Mom confirmed that I was with her and that I hadn't been at home. My grandma told her what had happened and when she went to show my mother where the girl was sitting, the glass of water my grandma left on the table was where the girl was sitting. The water was gone from the cup... creepy.

Spirit Invading Me,Canada,Misc,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Misc :: Spirit Invading Me

I t was this morning (April 2, 2007), I was dreaming of an asian/indian woman and I felt my stomach go all tense (there was some mild pain involved) and I realized she was looking for something inside of me. When I woke up I knew that she was trying to take a part of my life force. Luckily I wasn't missing anything. I think she wanted my soul. She was not one of the spirits in my house, she's a traveler. Always searching for something and this morning she decided to take a look inside of me. I felt violated and insecure after, but that wore off.

Another occasion was at night just before going to sleep. I was lying in my bed with my eyes closed and got this sudden urge to open them. When I did there was a brief moment where I saw a man (ghost) sitting in the chair next to my bed. He was a fisherman. This makes sense because I live in Nova Scotia. This ghost I know is the man who lives in our basement. I've sensed him before but this is the first time I've ever seen him.

A long time ago when I was only 4 or 5, I was sitting on the couch in the dark (I don't remember the circumstances) and I looked at the doorway onto the kitchen and standing there was a clearly female ghost wearing flowing white clothes. She didn't produce light but I could see her as if she had a light shining on her. I believe this is the woman who died of a heart attack in my house many years ago.

Black Bridge,"Wisconsin, United States",Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: Black Bridge

M y in-laws reside close to Black Bridge in Stevens Point, WI. It's located close to the Stora Enso paper mill in town. This happened about a year ago on a bright, sunny July afternoon. It was too hot to stay indoors and I was getting really antsy. I didn't want to stay home because the weather was too beautiful to waste indoors. My husband was working on building a greenhouse for my mother in law so I dragged his younger sisters, ages 12 and 15, with me on a walk.

His younger sisters were telling ghost stories as we head over to Black Bridge. One of the girls said Black Bridge was haunted and that people have seen a dark figure walk around the area. I laughed at their stories, saying that it's just an urban legend and brushed it off my shoulders. When we approached Black Bridge, there was a gate that held back people from slipping into the river. We stood on a ledge overlooking the river and the other side of town. On the river, we can see people on their boats and fishing.

The girls started talking about the stories they've heard about Black Bridge, I laughed at the non-sense. I leaned over the ledge to look below and I saw open shells of crayfish on rocks. I thought who would be crazy enough to go down there and catch crayfishes. Again, I brushed it off as if it was nothing and continued enjoying the scenery.

All of a sudden I heard a splashing sound coming from the waters. I looked down and saw pebbles dropping into the water. I leaned closer to look below the ledge at the bottom of the river to see who was throwing those pebbles but I could not locate anyone. The girls also heard this and tried to see where the pebbles were coming from. I thought this was a mean joke some local kids were playing with us because we were talking about ghost stories. So I told them to ignore it and we continued talking.

We heard the noise again. This time more rocks were thrown into the water and the splashes were louder. To our surprise when we looked down to the riverbank to see who was doing it, we didn't see anyone throwing those rocks but rocks were literally flying off the ground into the river. It was as if an invisible person was throwing rocks from the side of the river into the water.

I realized that this was not a human, local kid joke but something from the ""other"" side. We screamed and ran all the way back to my parents in law. Just when I thought nothing could happen on a beautiful, bright sunny day - anything anywhere is possible.

The Ghost at Work,Australia,Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: The Ghost at Work

D o I have a ghost at work? Well, my story begins with my aunt and I starting our own cleaning business for offices and such. We took on some subcontract work (which stupid me is still stuck doing). Debbie stopped working with me due to family commitments. The place we worked at has three levels, it is quite a big job and between the two of us, it takes 4.5 hours a night, 5 nights a week.

At first when Debbie worked there, not a lot happened, mainly her asking me what I want all the time as if I had called her (which of course I hadn't). I would keep telling her I hadn't called her and had no idea what she was on about. This went on for a few months. I of course was quite benevolent as to the other going ons and had paid no attention at all. After Debbie left I took on another person to help out with the work load.

One night we had gone onto the second level and there was this terrible stench coming from the kitchen in the common area, it had eventually taken over the whole floor. We forgot about the smell and went into the main office we cleaned. We were emptying waste paper bins when we heard this rattling of the double glass doors. I thought it was just someone going into the office across the hall. It happened again a few minutes later and upon investigation, we found no one. I am sure you can appreciate how frightened we both were. This happened again. We made it down stairs to the first level where we would not leave each others sight, bathrooms, kitchens and the lot got done together. I had left the keys (which is about ten keys total) on the table just inside the main glass doors.

We went to empty the waste paper bins. Upon our return, they had vanished. We checked everywhere and could not find them. We called security to escort us to our cars as we were quite frightened by this stage. The next day the keys were found by staff in the men's bathrooms, which happened to be the first place we looked. Many other small things went on over time like chemicals going missing, then showing up where we had never put them in the first place. Phones would start playing the radio all by themselves and stopping as we walked away (some phones if you press the hold button while not in use have this function).

Last night was one of the worst. The other staff member started before I did and called about 30 minutes before I got there to tell me someone (a women's voice) had said Hi but there was no one other than her in the building. She was scared to death on the phone so I told her to go downstairs until I arrived with my uncle who helped out from time to time. We all went up together and nothing else happened, until some hours later. I had gone down with Jodee in the lift to help her with some rubbish, I then left her and said I was going up to get Kerry, set alarms and such. When I got out of the lift, the vacuum cleaner was there but not Kerry. I heard this laughter come from my left side behind me. When I looked no one was there. Kerry then came out of the glass doors on my right. I asked him what he was laughing about but he claimed not to have been laughing. We went down the lift to pack everything away (we have our own cleaning room where we store everything). We could not find the mop so we all went up the lift again to level 1 to look for it. We found it and proceeded to come down again.

That was when I realized that there were 4 people in the lift, not 3. I can tell you I have never been so frightened in my life. It was only a glimpse but it was there. I said nothing until we reached the ground floor and thought we were safe in the cleaning room. We were sitting at the table (this room is quite large) when jodee started to freak out about the light. When we all looked up, the whole light, which is a tube light on chains, was swinging. Kerry steadied the light and we tested to see if the closing of the door could create this. Nothing we did other than manually pushing the light could make it move.

I have resigned today and will finish out the month, but I will no longer work in this office. I have never felt this scared of something I cannot see in my life.

Little Blue boy,"Texas, United States",Apparitions / Voices / Touches,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Apparitions / Voices / Touches :: Little Blue boy

A long time ago, when I was about 5, my mom was walking out of the kitchen to come get me. I was waiting for her because, to me, she was taking forever. I saw her freeze right in our hallway. Dead silent, with her mouth wide open. She looked at me with insanity. My mother sighed like she had just been choked. I asked her what was wrong. She looked at me with a surprised but scared face and replied ""I just saw a little blue boy with a blue ball laughing and playing in our hallway"", and ""He was running after his ball in the hall way..."" She said that he looked right at her and ran right through the cabinets in our hallways as if he was scared of her.

That was the first and last time she ever saw him. But when we walk through our hall way, we get a chill down our spine like something is there with us. Many times I feel as if I am being watched. We have no idea if anyone had died or been buried underneath our home. Although our house could have been built on top of where someone else was buried. We still wonder until this day if that little blue boy chases his blue ball down the hall way when we are gone!

I t was the summer before the 7th grade. I was about 12 years old and I was excited about going to my first sleep away camp for 2 weeks by myself. The day I got to the campsite, there were millions of other girls like me and I got assigned to a cabin with 5 other girls. On the first night of camp, we had a campfire and our cabin counselor told us about a lone haunted cabin smack in the middle of the woods. He told us of how a girl died in the cabin bathroom in some freak accident, and she came every summer to haunt that very cabin she died in. Of course, most of the girls were skeptical and we decided that night, after lights out, we'd check out the boarded up cabin. We were told not to go anywhere near the woods and anywhere near that cabin, but of course, we were curious and of course, we were bored!

So about a few hours after lights out (we stayed up until the counselor went to bed), it was about 1 am, the 6 of us grabbed flashlights and dressed in dark sweats and snuck out of the cabin very quietly. It took us 10 minutes to run to the cabin in the middle of the woods. Sure enough when we got there, we could see the police-sign ""do not cross"" all around the cabin. The windows and doors were boarded up but we broke down the door and snuck in. Everything inside the cabin had been ripped apart and torn down... And there weren't even any ground carpet or anything, it was a dirt floor. But there was one small round table in the middle of the ground floor and we all sat around it. We joined hands and waited for a sign in the dark. The next thing we know, after about 2 minutes of silence, there were loud tapping noises from the table! We all screamed and got up. I flipped on the switch on the cabin wall and all around where were sitting in a circle, there were TWO sets of footprints. It couldn't been any of us, all 6 of us were joining hands and none of us got up.

After we ran out of the room we went into the bathroom that was right next to the cabin. The bathroom door was also boarded up but we all smashed it down because we were curious. We opened the door and flipped on the switch and on the dirty bathroom mirror there was the letter 'J' in dried smeared blood. Right when we saw that, we just ran out of there. It was the scariest experience of my life.

The Little Boy in my Closet,"California, United States",Family / Friends Visits,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Family / Friends Visits :: The Little Boy in my Closet

A few years ago in the month of May, before I got married, I was about 14 years old, one night that I was trying to go to sleep, my bed was close to the wall and when I would be side ways I could see the closet which had no door, just a curtain, and the door to the hallway. That night, around 11:00 pm, my parents were in their bedroom, but not asleep because they go to sleep late. My brother was asleep in the living room couch.

I went to the bathroom, then came back in my bedroom and went to bed, I was facing the wall, but then I turned around to face the other side, when suddenly I saw a little boy looking at me right outside my closet. He looked like he was 6 or 7 years old. He was wearing clothes from back in the days, which remind me of the Mary Poppins Movies. I got really scared and I screamed for my mom and dad. The first time I screamed he didn't move, and I guess my parents didn't hear me. The second time he jumped in my closet and all I saw was the curtain move. When my parents came in my room, I was crying of fear. They asked me what was wrong and all I could say was ""the little boy in my closet"". My dad and brother checked the closet and found nothing... They said that maybe I was dreaming. I told them that minutes before that happened, I was in the bathroom, how could I fallen asleep really fast. I know what I saw and I was really afraid. That week I slept with my mom, and she told me that I would jump with any little noise I would hear.

One of my aunts came over and spread holy water around my room and we pray for the soul of the little boy. She said she felt the presence of the boy there at the time. Many people don't believe my story, but it happened. Others say that maybe it was the soul of one of my brothers that passed away when he was 5 months old, who I never met, because I was born 10 years later after he passed away. They say that he just wanted us to visit him, because his birthday was coming up. Well, we did go to visit his grave in Mexico, and since then, we haven't experienced nothing strange in that house.

We still live in the same house, but we added an extra room and now my old room is my little brother's room, who is 17 years old, and sometimes sleeps in the living room because he feels a little afraid. I believe that it was the spirit of my older brother that passed away, in someone else's body, who just stopped by to remind us that his birthday was coming and that he missed us, as much as we missed him.

Talk to Me,"California, United States",,"T his happened a few hours ago. I was in my kitchen working on homework and eating some oranges. While I was working, the door rang. I went to go answer it, thinking it was my brother. But it was nobody, and while I looked, I heard somebody say ""Talk to me"". Like a whisper. I was kind of surprised, but went back in and kept working. Later, the phone rang. The weird thing was, my phone rang on Line 2... Even though my parents didn't get a line 2 (we don't have fax or other phone numbers). I picked it up and there was like a raspy voice that said, ""Talk to me"". I hung up immediately. I was actually really creeped now.

I called up my brother who I thought might still be running (he has track and runs over 5 miles a day). When he picked up, I asked him if he could come home with his friends. He said sure and came really fast. He brought a big group of his friends (Gogo, Vivi, Robert, Rob, Troy, Joe, and Eric). Most of them went to my brother's room, but Troy and Joe stayed in the kitchen to help me with homework. After a little while, they were just watching me and helping me whenever, when Joe said he heard somebody. When I asked him who, he said he didn't know. He just heard somebody say ""Talk to me"". I told him what had happened earlier. And he was kind of stunned. Troy thought we were just crazy so he went to my brother's room.

Joe and I were talking and then I had to go walk my dog, so he came with me. As we were walking, we both heard something rustling in the bushes, and out of the bushes, we heard a voice. A raspy voice that sounded like it had a bad cold say ""Talk to me"". We were both scared, but Joe was a little less scared and he stepped in between me and the bush (and my dog...) and he asked the ""bush"" what it wanted. The bush just rustled and nothing happened. When he turned, his face was pale. I just stared at him and asked him what was wrong. He said that there was a face in the bush. But I didn't believe him.

We kept walking and when we got to the top of the hill, we saw a man we had never seen before at the park. He wore all white and had longish blonde hair. When we got to the park and sat down. The man was sitting near us on a bench. And we heard him say ""Talk to me"" and when we looked, he was gone. It was very weird and after that, we both ran down the hill (can't forget my dog!). When we got to my house, Joe asked me if I was okay. I told him I was fine. As a matter of fact, Joe is right here, next to me, as I write this.

If you have any idea why this ""guy""/""bush""/""voice"" thing was following me and Joe, please tell me. Because it's weird and scary. And Joe is 15 ... I'm 12. And neither of us know what's going on. Thank you very much.

Boy Scout Lane,"Wisconsin, United States",Ghost Hunting,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Ghost Hunting :: Boy Scout Lane

I n the quiet country side of Stevens Point, there is a piece of land that is not so quiet. It is Boy Scout Lane and its legend has been around for over 20 years. A brief summary for all who do not know about this place.

One version is that a troop of Boy Scouts on a camping trip were murdered by their bus driver on this isolated road. Another version of the story is that a Boy Scout troop mysteriously disappeared on this road and was never seen again. A third story is that a troop of Boy Scouts were camping here and some of them were wandering around at night and accidentally dropped a lantern resulting in a fire that killed the rest of the troop. However, there is no evidence of missing persons or a mass murder or a tragic fire. The road got its name because at one time the Boy Scouts owned the land there and had intentions of building a Boy Scout camp, but never happened.

Now that you know the history, I can explain our experience. It was a warm July night in 2005. My friend Erin was visiting our mutual friend Michelle and I up in Stevens Point. Michelle and I had worked at a Boy Scout Camp (ironic, huh?) that summer and Erin was to bring me back home in Minnesota when the weekend was over. We were bored, so Michelle suggested we go to Boy Scout Lane and do a little investigation. We had gone to a bookstore the day before and found the story in there. It intrigued us, so soon we were on our way with me in the backseat, video camera in hand.

Right when we turned onto the road, we felt uneasy. You know, that dreaded feeling of being watched. Being the young adults we are, we made jokes and tried to shake off that feeling. We went down the road and turned around, nothing special happened. What we saw when we got home is a different story.

Michelle hooked the video camera up to the television and played the footage. At first, it looked like nothing interesting. Until there was a point when I coughed (I had just gotten over a bad cold) and right after that, a heavy whispering breath followed. It was not me. Michelle, Erin and I looked at each other with wide eyes and we turned back to the television. The other two saw a bright ball of light flash by the screen for a split second, but I did not.

As I recorded us driving back to the main road, I faced the rolled up window (as everyone does, never thinking that spirits can go THROUGH things) towards the field that was supposed to turn into a camp. I had the infrared light on the camera, in case something moved in the field. Nothing moved in the field. Instead, we saw a face pressed up against the window. And no, it was not my face. The small screen of the video camera did not project enough light and I was not pressed up against the window. When the three of us saw this, we screamed and Michelle's mother started yelling at us. We ran into her room and told her what happened. She scorned us, yet refused to watch the footage.

Another little tidbit that we saw: In the rearview mirror there were two stationary lights in the upper corners. The area Boy Scout Lane is in is away from the city limits and no car was behind us. The lights did not leave until we got deep into town again. We have not gone out there since, but we have shown the tape to others and they see the same things. I don't know if Boy Scouts really haunt the area, but something does. I live in Stevens Point now and this town has a lot of history to it. Anything is possible and it just makes me more of a believer.

webmaster's note: it was not possible to publish the video recording mentioned on this story, as it is on videotape and not in digital format.

My Mother's House,"Texas, United States",Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: My Mother's House

M y mother's house is haunted. A week after we moved into the house, 23 years ago (in which she still lives), my mom says we (her three kids) began to do strange things. My oldest brother, Sam (13), would not sleep in any room alone and told her the eyes were watching him. My 2nd oldest brother, Mark, began to sleep walk, he would skip in circles in the living room, laughing at someone (no one else could see), skipping with him. After being told repeatedly to go to bed by my mom and Sam, Mark stopped, then ran for the door screaming he had to stop him, the fire would kill him. Mom was scared so she grabbed him to get him to wake up. Mark woke up and said he wanted water. The longer we stayed in the house, the more Mark would sleep walk and talk. As for Sam, he would get angry for anything and I mean anything. My mom had myself sharing a room with Sam, but worried Mark would get out of the house at night, she put Mark in the room with Sam (light sleeper). I was put in the smallest bedroom in the house next to my brothers and across from my parents.

Sam told mom he was hearing voices at night. Of course, mom asked ""what are they telling you?"". He got mad and stopped talking to her, because they weren't talking to him. At 3:00 am, My father woke up to hear me (4yrs) giggling. He thought I was still asleep so he didn't turn on my light to check on me. While he was getting water, he dropped the glass. He said he must have still been asleep himself. My mom woke up to see what was going on. They were going back to bed. I was still giggling so my mom turned my light on. I was sitting on my floor facing my closet wide awake. Mom asked who I was talking to and I told her ""my new friend"". Sam was standing at his door now. He told my parents I was talking to the eyes. I still remember my friend's name: ""Jeffery"".

Well, my mom did some research I guess and found a little boy had lived there named, you guessed it, Jeffery. She could not find what happened to him. Mom asked neighbors if they knew, one neighbor told my mom the previous people who lived there did not have kids but rumors had been around that they were devil worshippers. Grandma told dad to bless the house and where evil was, the holy water would stay. At our front door there is a cross my dad had made with the holy water. It has stayed through the years and it is still there today. After the blessing, Mark stopped sleep walking, Sam calmed down to a normal angry teenager but my friend stayed until I was 7. Not everything went away, other things happened and still happen, just not as often. I know of 5 ghosts in her house. I have seen 2, I only know of the other three, you hear one and smell the others cologne and perfume.

I think my kids see them, I watch my kids playing and they stop and look at something like they are watching someone or something walks by. So many things have happened, I've thought about writing a book about it, but I've never seem to get around to it. So here is a little bit of my experience and I hope you tell me what you think.

Haunting After Using a Ouija Board,"Washington, United States",Ouija Board / Seances,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Ouija Board / Seances :: Haunting After Using a Ouija Board

I believe my house is haunted. Every night, when I am the only one awake, I hear a faint scream coming from the kitchen/dining room area. Then I hear a thud, and a person chanting the name of a demon I happen to be somewhat familiar with, I have dreams of him almost every night. Chuchulain, at least I think that's how you spell it. Also, in my garage area, there is something in there that wants me as well. Now, my dad is a spiritual person who knows a lot about all these things, and whatever is in the garage is afraid of him. But it wants me, and the ""exorcism"" (for lack of a better word) my dad told me to use doesn't work. I use it in the garage and the garage ""freaks out"", it starts laughing so faintly that it's hard to hear it. If it helps any, I was using a ouija board about one or two days before all of this happened. It said I was in danger of death, but since my dad started showing up more often, the spirits have been backing down.

If anyone can offer ANY form of helpful advice, it is welcome.

Message From Beyond,"New York, United States",Family / Friends Visits,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Family / Friends Visits :: Message From Beyond

I had gone on vacation the summer of 2004 and my dad passed away in August of that 2004. I never got to say my last goodbyes. Time passed and strange things had been happening to my siblings in regards to my father. I, however, never encountered anything until late October of 2005.

My mother went away on vacation and left me alone for the first time. I didn't want to stay at home alone, being that my father died in the house, I was always spooked that he may appear on me. I decided to sleep over my girlfriend's house and every time I left my house, I made sure to close my bedroom door (a habit I have). I would stay the night then go to school and work and come back in the evening. When I got back to my place, I noticed my bedroom door was opened. At first, I thought I must have not shut the door properly so that night again, before I left, I packed my clothes and made sure I closed the door.

The following day I got back and again the door was opened. I thought I was going nuts, so I called my mom and told her what was happening. She kept telling me it could have been the wind that pushed the door open or that maybe I thought I had closed the door but really didn't. When I thought about the wind opening the door, it was an impossible task because there was no window near the door and those nights weren't that windy. The third night before I went to my girlfriend's house, I closed my bedroom door and to make sure I closed it right I pushed up against the door to see if it would open and nothing. I kept trying to open the door in different ways without touching the knob and it wouldn't budge and so this time I knew for sure the door was properly closed.

The following day I got back and again the door was opened! From then on, I knew someone or something was opening my door. I called my mom up again and told her what had happened. She told me it could have been my dad's spirit telling me something. At first, I didn't believe her until she asked me if I was doing anything my father wouldn't like me doing. As soon as she said that, it clicked. For one, my mother didn't know I was sleeping over my girlfriend's house and two, my father never liked me to sleep over anyone's house, he'd always say I had my own bed to sleep in, why sleep in someone else's.

That night, after I spoke to my mom, I decided to stay home and sleep there. I woke up and got ready to go to school and made sure again the door was closed. That evening, I got back and the door was still closed. My mom got back from her vacation and I tried it out with her and the door kept closed. Ever since I stopped sleeping over, the door incident also stopped. I guess my dad didn't want me sleeping over and opening my bedroom door was his way of telling me that I had my own bed to sleep in.

Dark Robed Night Visiters,"California, United States",Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: Dark Robed Night Visiters

M y experience happened from the age of 3 to 7 in the early 1980's. I lived in an old mobile home park in South Sacramento, CA. From a very young age I remember seeing dark robed figures. I could only see them at night when I was in bed. I would hear a whispering sound in my ears that only became louder the closer the figures got to my room. They wore long, dark robes with hoods. They looked 6 feet tall. Their face was covered with only their eyes showing. They did not look like human eyes. They were small and very bright. When I saw the figures I couldn't move or speak. I was terrified at first. Two of them would visit me. They would sometimes appear by my bedroom door or at my bed side with their arms out. I saw them many times during a four year time frame. Even though I experienced this many years ago, I still remember vividly how they looked and the sounds I would hear before I would see them. My parent's moved to a new house in 1984 and I have not seen the dark figures since then.

My Uncle in the Army,American Samoa,Family / Friends Visits,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Family / Friends Visits :: My Uncle in the Army

M y story starts two years ago, on december 31, 2004. My uncle was in a car crash and hit a truck and died instantly. Three days before, he got in a fight with my brother and my brother said he wished he died. So three days past and my uncle died. I say about a week later, my brother woke up in a cold sweat and went downstairs to get a drink. He was about to go upstairs when he saw a cloud forming where my uncle used to sit. He told me that my uncle came down to say that he forgives him and that he is the man of the house.

I hear his cough, he used to smoke, so he had a really bad cough. I get freaked out when I hear it. One time, I was watching TV with my family and we heard the freezer shut, yet nobody was in there, so we think that he was playing with us. He plays with the time on the coffee pot. He was in the Army so he puts the time in Army time. I would love to hear him again or see him.

Why does he not show his face? He has been dead for three years now? Let me know.

The House Near  the Field,"California, United States",Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: The House Near  the Field

I n 1979, three people were murdered in a house near a dirt field in Cypress, California. Two brothers and the older brother's wife were found dead within 2 weeks of each other,  their death were caused by their neck being broken by someone or something. The house was soon boarded up by the father of the sons and two white dogs were left to guard the property from any nosy people.

A year later, my family moved into the area and us kids would ride our bikes in the field near the house. Every time we got too close to the fence, the dogs would jump up and bark to scare us away. Until one day, they just sat there looking up at a window, where we saw three people standing there watching us. We took off immediately, but later were brought back by the police. Thinking we may have done something there, they contacted the father to open the house. We explained to them what we saw, but after entering the house they told us that no one had been in there. The owner told us that it was impossible that we had seen the dogs, due to the fact that they had died two weeks before. That is when we realized that not only did we see the ghost of the three murdered people, but also of the dogs. The house was never sold and eventually torn down.

But to this day, it remains an empty lot because no one wants to build on that site, it is believed what ever killed them still lingers and perhaps still awaits more victims.

The Bath Tub Ghost,"Pennsylvania, United States",Misc,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Misc :: The Bath Tub Ghost

T his story was not actually experienced by me, but told to me by someone I am close to. It happened two years ago. One summer day, when I was out swimming with my cousins, my Great Aunt told me a strange story about her house. It happened a long time ago when her son, my Uncle, was still young enough to be living at home. She told me he had a specific routine for when he would get ready for bed. He would always take a bath, wrap up in his green towel, then go to his room and close the door to get changed. One evening she saw my uncle come out of the bathroom in his green towel and go to his room. Normal, right? Then she noticed he left the bathroom light on, so she quickly went in and turned it off. All of a sudden, she heard a voice from around the corner, where the bath tub was, screaming ""Mom!"". My aunt flipped the light back on and ran around the corner and sitting there, in the bath tub, was my uncle, he hadn't left yet. He didn't act as if he had seen anything peculiar, it didn't seem as if he had seen anything at all, he was only upset that she had turned the light off on him. She didn't say anything about what she had seen and went to check his bedroom, empty.

After hearing this story, I excitedly told my Grandmother, who is somewhat of a skeptic, but is actually quite interested in what people claim to be true stories. I asked her if she knew her sister had been living in a haunted house and all she said was, ""That house isn't haunted..."" I asked her what she meant by that. Didn't she believe her? She said, ""I believe she saw what she saw, but that it was just deja vu..."" What she meant was that my aunt had become so accustom to my uncle's routine that she simply saw it unfolding in front of her eyes when she came near the bathroom. Deja Vu. But I myself believe that deja vu is only a feeling that you have meet someone or been somewhere when you come to said place or meet said person. I am unaware if deja vu can come in the form of a vision of something that has already happened. So I ask you. Do you think my aunt saw a spirit? Or was it just deja vu?

Ghost Wife,Mexico,,"M y father always told me that ghosts did in fact exist but me, being one of the skeptics, I never fully believed but I would still spare a moment and listen to him tell the stories. My grandmother and my grandfather weren't together at that moment, and from her part, she tells me that there is an evil shadow in the house, the one my grandfather and she had build. The shadow would be there because of an accident with her wedding ring, the one thing that turned my grandfather against her.

The year was 1996, my mother, father and I went looking for my godparents and my dad wanted me to meet someone before our vacation came to an end. I can still remember the house and what it used to look like, it was a two-stories house and its color was blue, not a dark blue or light-blue, but rather like an awkward kind of blue, there was no sparkle in the house, not a single bright light entered the house, as if it had no life, no happiness, only sorrow.

As I got out of my dad's van, he told me the owner of the house was  my grand papa, I really didn't thing much of it, I just wanted to see the house. But as I got closer to it, I suddenly felt a cold chill come upon me and as I drew nearer, I saw a shadow-like figure just standing in the back room, no face, no body, nothing, only a figure watching my every move. I turned around and ran towards my dad and I never looked back or went back again.

Later on, I found out that many also saw the figure, but not my grand papa, he was blinded with so much guilt he didn't care.

Sad Voice,"Texas, United States",Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: Sad Voice

T his happened two days ago, at around 7:00 am. My bed is against the wall and I was sleeping facing towards the wall. Out of nowhere, I woke up and looked at my phone for the time, after seeing that it was 7:00, I laid down to go back to bed because I still had two more hours to sleep before getting up. As I was laying there, I heard a male voice call out my name (I was at my house alone). The voice was coming from behind me and I closed my eyes out of fear, and said ""go away, go away"". It sounded very sad when it replied ""I guess I have to go now"" and after ""he"" said that, a great sense of sadness overcame me. I went back to bed and didn't hear anything again for the rest of the day, until I was talking to my friend about it.

As I was telling her about what happened, something started playing with my hair and I told it to stop and go somewhere else and it stopped. About 30 minutes later, there was a knocking noise coming from my dining room but no one was in there. I could also hear the sound of my cabinets in my kitchen shutting by themselves. I just ignored it because it didn't scare me. I went to bed around 2am and called my dog over to my bed (she ALWAYS sleeps with me) but it seemed she was too scared to get on my bed, as if someone was sitting next to me. She started growling at whatever it was that appeared to be next to me.

During the whole night I heard knocking sounds in my room. At 7am, the knocking got out of control. I told it to stop, and again, it did. I have had plenty of strange things happen to me, but this is the latest one and I want to know if anyone knows if someone is trying to tell me something.

One Last Goodbye,"New York, United States",Family / Friends Visits,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Family / Friends Visits :: One Last Goodbye

I 've heard this story all my life growing up and it continues to send shivers up my spine. It happened to my grandmother years ago. My mother was a teenager and she had gone out with her sister. My grandmother was at home doing chores. Suddenly, the door bell rings and it's my grandmothers' cousin. She looked like she was in a hurry, talking really fast. She told my grandmother she had stopped by to say goodbye. Puzzled, my grandmother asks her where she was going. Her cousin ignores her question and insists that she must leave at once. While leaving, her sweater gets caught on one of the dining room chairs. She tugged at her sweater and a small piece of wool ripped off. She left the apartment. My grandmother stood there completely bewildered because her cousin had never acted that way before. She decided to go back to her chores when the phone rang. It was my grandmothers cousins' sister calling to let her know that her sister had gotten into and accident and passed away a few hours earlier! My grandmother told her that her sister had just left her apartment ten minutes ago. After my grandmother hung up the phone, she went to sit in the dining room (she was in complete shock) when she noticed the piece of wool that her deceased cousin had left behind was still there!

Lady of the Backyard,"Pennsylvania, United States",Apparitions / Voices / Touches,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Apparitions / Voices / Touches :: Lady of the Backyard

T his just happened last night. It was about quarter to midnight. I was staying up late, as I usually do on the weekends. (I'm on spring break) I went to pour a cup of soda into the sink. As I got to the sink, something caught my eye. I ignored it the first time, but as I was pouring the flat soda in the sink, I saw it again out of the corner of my eye. I looked out the window directly in front of me and saw what looked like a woman dressed in a white wedding dress floating around in the backyard! I was scared. I tried to say something, but couldn't quite get the sound out. After watching for a few minutes, I saw the woman turn and stare at me. That just made me even more scared. She just kept staring and staring, until she finally vanished into thin air. I called my parents from bed, and they went outside. They didn't find anything. We all went to bed, but I was too scared to sleep. Several hours had gone by, and I began to hear a woman's voice humming the wedding march. I was so scared, so I turned the TV on and stayed up the rest of the night.

Old Victorian Lady,Puerto Rico,Apparitions / Voices / Touches,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Apparitions / Voices / Touches :: Old Victorian Lady

T his story happened when I was about a year old. We lived in my grandmother's house in Gurabo, PR, which was built on top of a sugar cane field and before it was a sugar cane field, it was an old spaniard cemetery. One night I was very sick with a fever and my mother got up in the middle of the night to get me warm milk because it put me to sleep easier. My mother went to the kitchen, the backdoor in the kitchen had rails on it, and a lady dressed in old victorian style clothing with a big puffy dress that women wore in the 1800's came right through the rails and the metal door! She wore a large hat which made her face dark and you could not see her. The lady was walking fast, like if she was in a rush, and she went right through my mother! My mother sort of did not pay much mind to it and went about her business warming up my milk... Then all of a sudden my mother shouted ""oh my god that lady just went into my daughters room!"". My mother rushed to my room... the lady was gone... and I was sitting on my bed giggling to myself. The high fever I had was gone!

Our House is Full of Spirits,"California, United States",Photographs / Videos / EVP,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Photographs / Videos / EVP :: Our House is Full of Spirits

M y name is Lenny and I am 40 years old. Most of my life I have been made fun of because of the things I see. I would like to prove to my friends and family that I'm not crazy, like they think. I HAVE BEEN ON A QUEST FOR THE LAST FIVE YEARS to capture a photo of just one of the many things that have came my way.

One late evening, me and my girlfriend decided that we needed some shelves in our room for the tv. After getting the shelves put up, I put the tv on one and plugged everything in. I then noticed that the cable was not working, so I followed the cable outside and saw that it had been disconnected. It was hanging about 3 inches away from the ground. When I went back inside, this is what was on the tv screen. I took several photos over the course of approximatively 45 min.

Again, we do not have cable service nor was the cable connected to the line outside. The picture seemed to very slightly move at times, in the way of the figure swaying back and forth and side to side, but was clear to both me and my girlfriend. We both describe it as a person standing there in a nightgown, holding a lantern in one hand and something else in the other. We have looked at the pictures with many different photo programs to possibly see who this person is, where they are at, what it was doing etc. Every time we look at the pictures we seem to see more and more detail.

The figure stayed on the tv until I turned the channel, when I turned it back the figure was gone. Hopefully you can examine the pictures and possibly give us some explanation to what we have seen. We would be happy to send by mail or e-mail copy's of all the pictures if you would like. Thank you for you time

PS: We have had several other experiences in our house. The most frequent involves a little girl named melissa. There is also a big beautiful cross that lights up our bathroom window at night. Endless photos of orbs, our animals even seem to notice them.

Analysis from Shane, regular user of this site: I did a photo analysis of all of his pictures and in the first one I was able to see that the object in the hand not holding the latern is a photo. The color is off as I had to adjust lighting and hue to get the photo to appear. I cleaned up the photo from Lenny's first picture and did different things to it to disclose what the spirit is holding in its hand.

Webmaster's comment: personally I can clearly identify a cloaked figure with a malicious grin. Pretty creepy. But then again, I know the human brain is wired to identify faces in many chaotic patterns, so it could be nothing.

"Voices, Lights & Shadows","Illinois, United States",Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: Voices, Lights & Shadows

I guess this all started about 6 months ago. I have lived at my residence now for about 3 1/2 years. I never experienced any problems. Then a while back I kept hearing the sound of music playing in the middle of the night and voices talking. I finally brought it up to my boyfriend and the kids about 4 months ago. The girls had said they heard music playing but thought it was the neighbor. My boyfriend said he didn't hear anything like that but that he heard, every morning when everyone was asleep, a baby crying. My oldest son actually woke me up in the middle of the night shortly after this, asking me to please turn down the radio because it was keeping him up (He was not there the night I asked the other kids about the incidents because I knew it would really scare him). We were asleep!

Since then, I have seen a figure walk into my son's room, little gleams of light pop up in the same places, and we even have a picture of my 2 year old we took on christmas morning with a very identifiable white figure in it! That really shook all of us up! What's really strange is the figure looks like a small child around the age of my son but the figure I saw walk into my other son's room looked like a young man.

For the last month now I haven't seen any lights or people but have heard sounds of someone walking around and making noises in the house when I am here alone, and the voices at night have lessened a little but when they talk, it is so fast and I can't understand what they are saying. But sometimes when they talk, it feels like someone is standing right next to you and I get this tremendous feeling of fear, like I want to scream and have before. I don't understand what these things want from me because I can't understand them. Some I feel no fear from and some I feel frozen with fear.

Can someone please help me! I feel like I am losing my mind and I fear for my children.

Voices in the Night,"Texas, United States",Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: Voices in the Night

I have so many stories, it was honestly hard for me to decide which one I wanted to write about first. This happened about two years ago, when my family and I had moved into our new apartment. At first there was nothing strange about the place, it seemed quiet. Weeks after being there, I was sleeping and had this strange dream about a ghost being in the house. It was so weird because the dream felt SO real that I woke up. When I woke up, I was really afraid and I knew it wasn't just a dream. I had the dream because in reality, there was really something in the house. I get feelings and have dreams that happen, that is how I know this. I just laid there and started praying so I could fall asleep because I was super scared and I could feel there was something in there. I fell asleep and nothing happened for a couple of days, until I was in my room trying to sleep.

As I was falling asleep, I heard this laugh that sounded kind of like a duck sound. It's so hard to explain but it didn't scare me then, because it kind of sounded like my dad and so I thought it was probably him. I fell asleep and I woke up to that laugh again. I walked out of my room and went into the living room and asked my dad and brother to stop playing around because I was trying to sleep. They both looked at me like they didn't know what I was talking about. Neither of them had gone near my room. I was a little scared at this point but knew I had to ignore it and go back to bed. Well for the third time I woke up to the laugh again, but this time closer to my ear it seemed like. Nobody was awake at this time so I knew for a fact it wasn't my dad, mom or brother etc.

The next day I told my family about it and they believed me because stuff like this always happens to me and I usually experience everything first. After a couple of more days went by, I started to hear things all the time, especially when it got dark out. Sometimes I would even hear things that nobody else could hear. One night while I was watching tv with my friend Lily, while she waited for her ride, she looked at me and asked ""aren't yall going to get that"". I had no idea what she was talking about. She said someone knocked on the door. I looked out and even opened the door and no one was there. She left, and then about 30 minutes later, as I continued to watch TV, I hear a knock at my door. I looked at my parents and they seemed to not have heard or noticed that someone was at the door. I asked them if they were going to answer it, but they just simply told me they didn't hear anything (NOTE: our couches and TV were right there where our front door was, so there's no way that both of my parents couldn't have heard the knocking). I went to the door and looked out and nobody was there, I even walked further down from the door to see if whoever it was could be found but saw no one. I came in and sat back down and finished watching TV.

As I was sitting there I heard the screen door slide open and I looked at my dad and again he didn't seem to have heard anything. This time, I didn't tell them anything or say anything. I was so scared and I started to think I was going crazy because nobody else could hear the things that I did. I just stared at the screen door and could've sworn someone was about to come in, then the feeling I had went away. I left and went off into my room. While I was trying to fall asleep I could hear things drop in my room and sounds of knees crackling and popping as if someone was walking. It was really hard for me to sleep and I was always scared and I didn't get a good feeling out of anything I experienced. I knew it couldn't be anything good.

I told my parents about all the things that had been happening and my mom told me she also had heard things. She said she would hear me call out her name while I was at work. My mom only speaks spanish so her english skills aren't all that great. One day she asked me what ""ghost inside"" meant. I translated and asked her why she wanted to know and she just said that it was nothing, she was just curious. I still wanted to know what it meant and she never told me until after we moved. She said she would be watching TV and the channels would always flip on their own to a blank screen that read ""GHOST INSIDE"" as the caption. She thought it was just some show or something. I know it's not a show. I've never heard of a show called ghost inside and even if there was, why would the channels always flip to that one blank screen when she would be watching TV alone?

I would also hear voices that didn't belong in the shows I watched. It was like random sentences or words that would just pop out, out of nowhere. The TV would also turn off and on on it's own. Of course at the time, we thought maybe the TV was having problems but we still have it now and there is nothing wrong with it. I got really depressed while living there. A lot of things started going wrong and it was just crazy. I was fine after we left and I felt so different when I wasn't at home. I had friends that used to live at those apartments and they told me they would hear things and see things all the time and this was before we lived there. We don't live there anymore and I've heard and felt a couple of things at my new home but it feels nothing like the things that happened to me there.

Leave comments if you'd like, I'll put up better stories later.

Looked Like my Little Brother,Philippines,Apparitions / Voices / Touches,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Apparitions / Voices / Touches :: Looked Like my Little Brother

O ur house was built on a old rice field. This rice fields were once a battlefield during World War II. The house was built during the 60's. I know for a fact our house is haunted but I have not experienced anything first hand until 4 years ago. My younger brother was born late; we have a 17-year gap (I do have another brother 2 years younger than me). When he learned how to watch TV, he always do it in my parent's room, which was located at the top of our stairs, so nobody will disturb him. He usually seats at the edge of the bed so he can easily climb down for bathroom breaks.

I came home one Saturday from work and it was almost lunchtime. I was on a graveyard shift then and I usually just go to my room first to change my clothes. When I climbed up the stairs, my parent's room was open and I saw my little brother seating at the edge of the bed watching TV. I did not disturb him and just went to my room and change. After changing, I just went straight down stairs and saw that lunch was ready. I called my little brother for lunch, but then my mother, who was at the kitchen, just shouted at me ""he is not here, he went to church with Grandma!"". I just freaked out. I went back up stairs to check if it's true and when I entered the room, nobody was there. I ran back down so freaked out and told my mom what I saw. She just brushes it off and said that I'm just tired.

I know what I saw and it really looks like my little brother... That little boy did not show up again until now.

The Old Witch,India,Apparitions / Voices / Touches,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Apparitions / Voices / Touches :: The Old Witch

T his didn't happen to me but it happened to my grandma. My grandma was a teenager, like 16 or 17. This happened in India and indian girls used to make cotton with something called ""charka"". They came back from making cotton and it was late at night. My grandma and her village girls were walking back, when they heard some lady say one of the girl's names. She turned around and saw a lady with her hair open, big teeth, she had her feet and hands backwards and she was laughing! While they watched her, she slowly started saying their names, one by one, and they got so scared that they left everything back and ran!

Both my mom side and my dad side grandma's have experienced and know stories like these and they also said back then, there were many things like these. My grandma also told me that if you responded back to the call or looked back, you would die! It was hard, because you never knew who was calling you.

I know many stories like these, after hearing this story I do believe that there are things like witches and angels and many other things.

The Alumnus Teacher in Quesci,Philippines,Family / Friends Visits,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Family / Friends Visits :: The Alumnus Teacher in Quesci

M s. Nenita Cudal was our batch adviser for our graduating batch 2005. She has no husband and she dedicated her whole life in making Quezon City Science's student's life better. She is the last surviving teacher from the establishment of the school 40 years ago. Since it was almost March at that time, we had been practicing the Junior and Senior Prom rights. We were maintained in a line inside the big covered court because of the hot blaze of the sun. It was almost afternoon.

Me and my friend, Pepe, decided that we would leave the court and stay in the gazeebo to play chess together with the others, because we believed that the practice is such a waste of time. We told our adviser that we would just go to the restroom because she wouldn't permit us to leave the practice.

As we are about to run to the gazeebo, Ms.Cudal caught us and we made an excuse of ""we're just going to the CR"" thing. Of course, she have got that easily and we were forced to go back to the practice. When we got back to our lines, I saw Ms. Cudal alone looking at our batch. To avoid detection ,because she might tell our teacher that we tried to escape, I just didn't tried to take a glimpse of her.

Until our principal, Mrs.Cavo gave an announcement. I was so shocked when she said that Ms. Cudal died in the hospital this 6:00 in the morning because of bone cancer. We tried to find her, but she was not there.

For the last moment, she did her role as our batch adviser and a xientian mentor.

Wake Up Call,"New York, United States",Apparitions / Voices / Touches,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Apparitions / Voices / Touches :: Wake Up Call

T his incident took place a couple years ago, on the first day back to school for the kids, in September. I work nights and as I usually do, after I get the kids off to school in the morning, I go back to bed. My husband and I only have one vehicle, so I have to get up and go get him at lunchtime at his workplace, so we can go have lunch together. I usually set the alarm clock for 11 am, so I have time to get cleaned up, and head out to get him by noon.

Well, this particular morning, I did forget to set the alarm clock, I wasn't used to doing it since the kids were on summer break and I didn't need the car.  I fell soundly asleep, an earthquake would not have woke me up! Then, I don't know where it came from or how, a very loud, raspy, sharp voice rang out, WAKE UP! I sprang out of that bed! I turned to look at that clock, and wouldn't you know, it was exactly 11 am! There was indeed a strange vibe about the room, and it did give me the creeps.

I have not forgot to set the alarm clock since then. I have told everyone I know about this. I'm not sure if they believe me or not, quite frankly, I don't care. I know I heard what I heard. This voice has come back at other times since then, I still don't know why, or who. At times, I welcome its existence.

The Life of a Medium,"California, United States",Psychic / Medium,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Psychic / Medium :: The Life of a Medium

M y name is Janet and this is just a small part of my story. Let's start from the beginning of THIS STORY. Yes, I say THIS STORY, because I have experienced the paranormal since the age of 4. But, that is another story altogether. Let's talk about THIS STORY. The year is 2004, the location is Orland, California. We had just moved from Salinas, California to Orland, California. The very first night at my new home. My husband and I were sleeping in the front room, due to the fact that we had not moved in all of our furniture. It was just my husband and I in the house. We had a long hard day because of the move and my husband instantly fell into a deep sleep. I laid next to him, I was still awake. Then it occurred. Something that I had not expected to happen, but it did. I heard a heart wrenching wailing cry of a woman. It sounded like she was inside the house. I got up immediately and tried to wake up my husband, but he would not wake up. I then proceeded to search the house, to see if there was anyone in the house. Then I went outside to see if the crying was coming from outside. I had came to the conclusion that the sound did not come from outside, that it was definitely coming from the inside of my new home. As I came back in the crying just stopped. When the crying ceased, I attempted again to wake up my husband and he woke up instantly. That is when the fun began. I came to the realization that my house was truly haunted.

After this occurrence, the activity in the house had stopped for 2 months, well so I thought. The reason why I say this is because sometimes cupboards were open, I knew I didn't open them. Objects in the house would wind up missing and then reappear again and the animals (my dogs and cats) would seem to be aware of a presence. On my birthday, I received a voice recorder. Since I was a spiritual person, I wanted to see if I could pick up family voices of family members that passed on. Little did I know that it wasn't my family member's voices that I would be picking up on my recorder. I would record at night, when my family was asleep. In the morning when I played the recorder from the previous night, there was this ominous EVP (Electronic Voice Phenomenon), that caused the hair on the back of my neck to stand up on end.

After I realized that I was getting EVPs, I became addicted to the practice of EVP work. I would get EVPs every night that I recorded. Then the hauntings became physical. I knew that we had more than one ghost, because there were various voices on the recordings. I felt the presence of a male, female and a child spirit in the home and the recorder backed up my hunch. My daughter started receiving scratches on her body. My daughter would also be tripped and pushed around by the entities. Then to my horror, the entities would take control of my daughter's body.

When the more serious incidents occurred, I became aware that I needed help. I sought the help of the Catholic Church, even though I am not Catholic. I had the house blessed by a priest. When the house was blessed, the attacks started occurring more on a frequent basis and became more severe. I saw the shift of a benevolent haunting to more of a malevolent haunting. The attacks began when I became confrontational with the entities. The verbal confrontation I had with the entities was that of anger, yelling and even cursing. When my anger subsided, I took more of a spiritual approach, asking for assistance from a higher power. Then I would again become angry and confronted the entities and told them that they would take me on and deal with me, because I felt I could handle them and leave my daughter alone. This went on for several months. Finally we had enough and my family and I decided to leave this home and leave the town altogether. I had no inkling of an idea that the entities would actually follow us!

Since then, we have moved to two different cities and are still experiencing the hauntings. I was frightened and confrontational with the entities for a very long time. I sought out guidance through studying various books, spiritual classes and educating myself on hauntings. I enhanced my abilities as a medium. I always knew I was gifted and started using my abilities to form a communication with the entities. I delved towards co-habiting with the entities. This is when the malevolence of the hauntings started to subside. This is by no means the end or the beginning of my story. I felt that this is a good place to start. Just because you are experiencing a haunting, doesn't mean you have to be a victim to it. There are ways to empower yourself. I know I did. If I can overcome it, I know anyone else can.

Haunted Laundry Room,Canada,Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: Haunted Laundry Room

T his happened a couple of years ago. We had just moved into a new house, I was getting used to living in a different neighborhood and it wasn't really easy. One night, my parents weren't home so I invited my friend over. We were sitting in my room talking about boys when my friend said she had to go to the washroom. While she was in the washroom, I went downstairs to go get a snack for us to eat without telling her. As I went downstairs, she came out of the washroom and was stunned I was coming back upstairs, she asked ""how did you leave so quickly when I was just talking to you?"". I was shocked, I told her that I had been downstairs and I didn't even talk to her while she was in the bathroom. We both were freaked out and she told me the voice sounded exactly like mine.

That night, when my parents returned home, me and my friend were getting ready to go to bed. We fell asleep at around 1:30am. The next morning, I awoke and when my friend left to go home. I was walking up the stairs. I had this feeling as if someone was following me, I looked back and I saw this dark thing walking behind me, and, as it walked after me, its hood came out of more and more. I ran to my bedroom and locked the door.

I told my parents about what had happened, they really didn't believe me, so I asked my mom who had lived in this house before us and she told me that this lady and her kids had lived here . She had this worried look on her face. I asked her what had happened and in a light voice, she said the women who lived here before had committed suicide in our laundry room. I was terrified. Some time after that, I went to do my laundry when the door had slammed shut. I was scared to death, I quickly opened the door and ran out of the laundry room.

After that day, I never saw anything again until I had to take care of my baby cousin with my friend. We were playing with her in this spare room when she pointed up at the ceiling and started to cry uncontrollably. I ran and got my camera, when I took a picture of where she was pointing, I could see this white weird shaped thing. We were terrified. After that, I showed my parents the picture and they invited the priest to bless our house.

Marry and the Rose Scent,"Illinois, United States",Misc,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Misc :: Marry and the Rose Scent

O nce, I went to my grandmother's house when I was in third grade. My Grandfather had just died a little while ago. Since the grave yard he was buried in was rather close to my grandma's house (only about 5 minutes away), we decided we would go take a visit to his grave. We found his grave. My Grandma was kind of sad and depressed so we asked her if she wanted to come look around the grave yard with us (my mom, siblings and I). She told us she wanted to stay there a while longer and that she wanted to be alone so we should go look around at the rest of our family member's graves and then just go look at other places in the graveyard, too. So we did.

We looked at our lost family members and other places until we finished that. We kept walking though. We walked to the richer area (meaning the graves that were higher, bigger, and nicer looking). There was one that caught our eyes, so we walked closer to it. The name was Marry. There were toys around it! Then all of the sudden, I smelt something! ""Did you smell that?!?"" I asked my family. Only my mother said she did. What we smelt was a rose scent. No! It was too light to have been a perfume. And we only smelt it for about a second. So we waited at the grave until my grandma found us. We told her of what had occurred. Then she told us about the grave.

There was a little girl who was only 13. She was such a good person and hoped to become a nun. She was said to have always used rose perfume. Then one day, when she was sick she passed away. They say whenever you smell the perfume, it would heal you.

The Blue Lady With a Baby,"California, United States",Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: The Blue Lady With a Baby

T his happened at my house in Fontana, CA. It happened in the ""TOY ROOM"", that's what we called it. Every time my family and I went outside, you could hear a baby crying from inside the house. Then one time, I was curious why a baby was crying. And it couldn't be us because we were all grown up. I went walking all around the house and I saw a blue lady holding a baby just staring at me from the window. Everybody was outside so I went inside and I saw her go up the attic. I went to go tell my parents and they didn't believe me, so I had to figure it out on my own. I went up on the attic and the baby was still crying. Until I saw the baby. The baby stopped crying... Ever since that day, I never heard the baby crying and never saw the blue lady ever again! But no one believed me.

1 year later, I heard my sister tell my mom that she saw a blue lady with a baby That's when I told her ""just go in the attic and until you see the baby... The baby will stop crying"". So she did... And after that she never saw them again!

Kate's Creepy Room,Australia,Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: Kate's Creepy Room

I was staying at my grandparents place, which is where my aunty and her two children also live. My aunty was due to go into hospital the next day and had to have a large amount of laxatives to empty her bowels. So myself and another of my cousins were staying to help out with her two kids because my nan and pop were away at the time.

There are three rooms in the house, all closely located. My cousin stephen was to sleep in his own room, further from where I was sleeping in my cousin Kate's room. Kate was going to sleep in my nan and pops room with my other cousin rachael. My aunt was going to sleep on the couch as she didn't want to wake anyone getting up every 5 minutes to go to the loo.

Everyone was getting ready for bed and I was laying on Kate's bed, waiting for my aunt to turn out the light for me (I was like 11). As I lay there with my eyes closed, I could feel a pawing sensation at the end of my legs. They had several dogs and cats, I assumed it was just one of them, but when I looked up to see which one it was, there was nothing there. But I could still feel it!

Then my aunt came to the door and handed me their new little kitten to sleep with and turned out the light. I was a bit freaked out so I laid patting the cat who was staring up at the wall behind my head. The cat then flipped out and took off out of the room as the door was open. I looked up and felt strangely cold as it was still in summer and had been hot moments before.

Her bed was placed was next to a window and you could hear everything that was outside. I was still trying to sleep when I heard the sound of two men talking outside. At first, I thought it was someone walking past their yards fence, but realized that the language they were using was too formal to be anyone who lived in this town. I then looked outside to see who it was, but there was no one there. I could still hear the two men talking.

As I laid back down, my cousin kate scared me because I was really freaked out now and could just make out her outline, as it was dark in the hall. I yelled at her and chased her out of the room, back into where she was sleeping and shut the door to that room. I laid back down on my bed and couldn't sleep. I could no longer hear the two men talking, but felt cold again. I was going to get up to go find another blanket and looked over towards the doorway where the light switch was next to. In the doorway, I could once again make out an outline of a little girl. I froze because I knew it couldn't be my cousin kate, as the girl had much longer hair and was shorter than kate. Also, the doors in my nan and pops house squeak quite loudly if they are opened or closed, and I had heard nothing so she couldn't have opened the door to come out again.

When I realized it wasn't kate, I looked at the figure who had something that was gleaming in her hand. I thought it to be a long knife blade. The figure then slowly moved in towards me and ,as it did, I screamed as loudly as I could for my aunty to come and closed my eyes.

My aunt came quickly and turned on the light, asking me what was wrong. I just ignored her and jumped out of the bed, ran into where my cousin kate was sleeping and stopped. It definitely wasn't kate because she was dead asleep.

Totally freaked out, I refused to sleep in the room and went into the kitchen at the other end of the house with my aunt while she had a smoke. She then needed to visit the loo again and left me standing there. I then noticed her dog sitting at my feet, so I bent down to pat it and, as I did, I felt the hand of someone rub my back. It was like they were reassuring me that I was okay. When I stood up no one was there.

To this day I will not sleep in that room, and Kate also had seen and heard things.

Voice in my Head,Philippines,Apparitions / Voices / Touches,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Apparitions / Voices / Touches :: Voice in my Head

I t was late at night, six years ago, when I, then 4 years old, was sleeping with my maid at my side, inside my room. The room itself is located on the second floor of the house. While sleeping, I heard a voice calling my name. I stood up and started walking towards the door, eyes closed. I opened the door and walked out. I heard the voice whispering in my ear, calling me, telling me to go down the stairs. Without really knowing it, I went down those long and scary stairs.

The voice in my ear did not stop calling and when I finally got down, the voice suddenly stopped. When morning came, my parents and everybody else asked me why I was there in the maids room. I answered that a voice was calling me, but I said that I thought that it was the maid that was calling me. The maid said that she was fast asleep and never called me to go down to the maids room.

Up until this very moment, that night is still haunting my dreams, but I always try to forget about that night since I found out that it wasn't normal, but I guess some kids sleep walk.

Weird Things Happening to Me,United Kingdom,Misc,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Misc :: Weird Things Happening to Me

A lot of things has happened to me in the past and present, so God knows what is yet to come in the future! This is some I would like to tell. Me and my friend Leanne were in the girls toilets at school, just talking, we had only been in there for at least 10 seconds, nobody at all was in the toilets, only us. We suddenly heard this huge roar, it sounded like moaning but it was as deep as a lion's roar! Me and Leanne screamed and ran to the playground! Another time was when I was at home, I kept hearing voices saying ""megannnn"" but it was being whispered in a ghostly voice. One time, this happened when I was in bed, I turned over and saw a blue outline of a person standing in my room and the same happened the next night. It was not a dream! My mum said it could have been my dead nan who was whispering my name.

I find it very weird that I have to open the shower curtain when I am in the bathroom does anyone know why? I have a shed at the bottom of the garden and if you knock on it, it will answer you back by knocking back or scratching the walls! I so believe in ghosts! Have any of you ever had something happen to you like that?

Soda Line,"Wisconsin, United States",Poltergeists / Physical Manifestations,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Poltergeists / Physical Manifestations :: Soda Line

M y family loves to have soda. I hate it when the kids throw it in the garbage, so we have a bag in the door to the basement. They just throw the soda in that. Well, one day, my family and I were done eating. We heard a huge crash. Then a little push on the chairs. We heard a soft breathing voice. And it got a little colder. I shouted ""WHO IS THERE!"". First, I thought it was our cat. But it wasn't. We heard the soda can bag rattle and then it sounded like it fell down the steps. I got up and my kids followed me. We looked down the steps, and all the soda (about 20) were in a straight line. I picked them up and put them in the bag.

After a long day at work, I sat down and had myself a diet cola. When I was done, I went to throw it away. But the bag was gone. That's not it, the soda cans that I picked up were still in that straight line at the bottom of the steps.

We sold that house to a friend of mine. She does not have a bag for the soda. But she told me that there was a strange soda line at the bottom of the steps.

Her as a single mom, heard one day someone walking upstairs. She has NO pets. And her son was with the father. Strange huh?

My Little Brother's Ghost Hunting,"Georgia, United States",Apparitions / Voices / Touches,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Apparitions / Voices / Touches :: My Little Brother's Ghost Hunting

W hen I was about 12 years old, I was at a stage when everything was stupid to me. My little brother, who was about 9 then, was a big believer in ghosts. We lived in a big house, and he thought we had ghosts since some people killed themselves in the house. Izeck, my brother, would have friends over and go ghost hunting. They would wake me, my other sister and my parents up by saying they saw a ghost. Les, my sister who was about 6 or 7, believed them. If it was saturday and raining they would stay up all night and search for ghosts. Me, the oldest, thought they were weird and stayed out of their business. Before I knew ghosts were real.

It was Saturday, it was storming and it was around 3:00 in the afternoon. Dad was with friends, mom was at a baby shower. I was babysitting and I was watching a movie. Of course Izeck and Les were coming up with a ghost plan in the kitchen. I got up from the couch and looked at the chalk board they were using. ""HEY BECKIE!"" said Les in her happy voice. I looked away and was getting stuff to make sandwiches for me and my siblings. ""Would you like to help with ghost hunting"" asked Izeck. ""YEAH!"" shouted Les. I turned around and shook my head no. ""OH PLEASE BECKIE PLEASE!"" shouted Les. ""Ham or Jelly?"" I asked ""BECKIE!"" moaned Izeck. I gave them their sandwiches and sat down in the living room. They wouldn't leave me alone with the GHOST thing. So I said yes.

It was about 4:30pm and mom was home. Izeck and Les were still making their ghost plan and I didn't bother to listen. Mom said it was good that were all playing a game together, but Les said it wasn't a game. Mom rolled her eyes with me following.

At 8:30pm, the storm was worse and the house shook. ""IT IS TIME LESLY"" said Izeck. ""It's Les"" I said. Izeck hit my arm and grabbed Les and I followed them upstairs. We went in a room that I didn't even know we had. But there were no lights. No windows. No closets. Only one little rocking chair. I sat down in it and Les threw me out of it. ""STOP!"" she shouted ""THAT IS CASSIDYS CHAIR!"". I walked over by her and told her to settle down. ""Who is Cassidy?"" I asked, ""A friend of yours"" Izeck and Les's mouths dropped open. ""Friend"" they said ""SHE IS THE GHOST WE BEEN TELLING YOU ABOUT!"" shouted Les. ""Really?"" I asked.

Les shook me and pointed to the chair. It was rocking! ALL BY ITSELF! It was true. They really saw a ghost. We have a ghost in our house! ""Cassidy"" whispered Izeck ""It is us. Come on girl. It is ok"". We heard a loud thunder from the storm and lightning. We saw a white figure in the rocking chair. She was about 15 to 17. She was wearing a white dress and had a basket full of dead flowers. With dead skin too.

To this day I do not go with Izeck and Les upstairs, but I swear that I hear the rocking chair squeek. And in my money vase, there was a dead flower.

Shadowy Legs,Malaysia,Demons / Possessions / Exorcisms,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Demons / Possessions / Exorcisms :: Shadowy Legs

T his happened last saturday. I've never been freaked out like this in my life before. It was about 2.30pm, my sister came home to have lunch with me. We were sitting in the living room. My sister was seated facing to kitchen walkways and I was sitting facing the wall. For a few second we chatted, suddenly I saw my sister turned her head to kitchen walkway. She was looking at something which bothering her. But I didn't really take notice on that, as I was busy talking to her. She didn't really pay much attention to me but kept looking at the kitchen walkways. Her face expression showed something unexplainable... (The back door was opened as I was doing some cleaning in my kitchen and my bedroom. We normally will not open the back door as the back way is known to be haunted by everyone at my home including neighbors). She didn't tell me anything at the time. She asked me why I let the back door opened. I said I was doing some cleaning stuff. She still kept her mouth shut (maybe she didn't want to scare me).

After few moment, she told me what she saw in her naked eyes. She saw a shadow only with the legs was walking towards my dad's room ( the last room in the house). Human legs and only up the knees. I was very very scared and freaked out

My sister left home. I was home alone. I turned on my radio into high volume. By 5pm, I finished my house work. But the fear was still inside me. Nothing happened.

Yesterday was sunday, I went out with my nephew in the afternoon back home at about 7pm. My nephew was not really feeling well at the time. I brought him to a clinic. After he had the medicine, he was asleep. I went to kitchen to prepare dinner for him and me.

A few minutes went by, when suddenly he woke up screaming like he was being haunted and disturbed by ""someone"". He screamed and screamed. His face turned black like a demon was occupying his body. I got to him to calm him. He was still screaming. My dad was just back at home. We both tried to calm him down. Nothing can be done. He is screaming and telling us ""wait, he will show off... Wait he will show off"".

My fears and tears were unimaginable at the time. Luckily, my bro who is just got married stays a few doors away from my house. Apparently he heard the screams, rushed to my house and carried my nephew, who is 6 years, to his house. He stopped his screams. We gave him plain water and let him relaxed.

Meanwhile, I immediately called a medium and brought him to my nephew. The medium did something. My nephew was a bit ok, like he was freed and his face was bright as before. The medium brought us to separate rooms and told us that there is one very dangerous demon at my house and it just showed off to my little nephew. That's why he screamed like that (I didn't tell the medium what my nephew told us during his screaming).

You tell me how am going to live in this house after this? Now my work is finished and I need to go home. But, I'm really scared to enter to my house. Please pray for me.

Ghost Rat,"California, United States",Pets / Animals,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Pets / Animals :: Ghost Rat

Y ou've heard that if someone (or something) dies in your house, it can come back as a ghost? It turns out it is sometimes true. I have always had rats for a pet. I just moved recently and mine died. I was sleeping, and woke up in the middle of the night to get a drink. I came back in my room, and I saw the wheel moving in the cage. My eyes were already adjusted to the dark, and I saw nothing in the wheel. I put my hand in it, I felt nothing. It was the freakiest thing I ever saw.

Later, I saw a little foggy-like light in the wheel, moving. It was my rat! The ghost rat, of course. Then I started to see two... My parents woke up and saw it too. Then my little sister saw it and started screaming like the dickens. My parents came in AGAIN and didn't see the foggy-like substance, but they saw the wheel moving. You could imagine how creepy and weird it was. To this day, I am still seeing it. I wonder when it will stop... Sorry, no pictures, but I hope you believe me.

Barn Ghost,"Wisconsin, United States",Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: Barn Ghost

I never once heard a person say they didn't believe in ghosts. But I couldn't help from noticing I was one of them. I was going out to the barn with my husband. He told me he had to go feed the bulls their night snack. And I had to go feed the cats. It was about 9:00 p.m. and we usually come out at 7:00 and feed them supper. But we had to go to the kids concert. David (my husband) went out back, and I went in the barn to the cat room, which we called it. Casper, our all white cat, was following me to the back room. I tried to turn on the lights but they didn't go on. So I turned on our lantern. I opened the door and pulled out the cat food bag. I felt a push on me, and I turned around quickly. No one was there. I thought it must be the cats, there always so pushy when it comes to feeding time.

I bended down again and started pouring their food. After that I got their water and milk, I set it down and pet the cats. Then another push came to me. And this time, I tripped, but didn't fall. ""Knock it of"" I said. Then the door closed and it left a loud noise going all around the barn. ""DAVID!"" I shouted. I looked out the window and I saw a figure move past quickly. ""DAVID!"" I shouted again. I heard a whisper, but could not make out who or what it said. I looked out the window again and I saw the figure again. But it didn't move. ""DAVID!"" I shouted again.

I went out of the cat room and kept on shouting for David. I heard another whisper. At this point I was terrified. I saw something go past me and it was blackish-whitish. Then I felt another push on my shoulder. Then I heard a little girl cry ""HELP ME HELP ME!"". It wasn't my children, I don't have any daughters. I followed the voice, and saw a little girl dress in a white dress, she looked like she came from the 1800's. Then she disappeared. I ran out of the barn, got my husband and he came in. I saw was her ghost hanging from a rope. Then the ghost disappeared.

We looked her up on the internet and it said that she was hung in our barn in the late 1900's! The internet showed a picture of a little girl dressed in a white dress. To this day (2 years later) we still see the little girl. But we never try to run away or get the ghost angry.

Night Visitor,"Connecticut, United States",Apparitions / Voices / Touches,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Apparitions / Voices / Touches :: Night Visitor

I don't know if I am dreaming or if I am having a paranormal experience. Two nights ago, I was asleep when I was awakened by someone standing alongside my bed and applying pressure to my face. The only way I know how to describe it is as if you were standing in your kitchen leaning into the counter and kneading dough. It didn't hurt. It was just a very strange sensation. I sat up immediately thinking it was one of my children or my husband trying to wake me to tell me something. No one was standing in the room. My husband was fast asleep next to me. I was shakened but not really frightened. I went back to bed with the covers over my head.

I told my family what happened the next day. We all got a good laugh. However, my youngest son, who is six, felt scared and decided he wanted to sleep with me last night. It was in the middle of the night when I was awakened by someone or something pressing against my stomach. At first I thought it was my son just snuggling up against me. Unfortunately, he was fast asleep. I tried to call out to my husband but I didn't want to wake my son so I stopped. I firmly said out loud, whomever is in here go away and let me sleep. I immediately flipped the blankets over the top of my head and didn't let any limbs hang out. I was scared last night. It was a weird sensation. I wasn't frightened because it didn't seem evil. However, I was scared because I don't know what to make of it or the situation.

Any ideas? Am I dreaming? Is someone trying to contact me from beyond? Or am I nuts?

Hands on my Shoulder,"Texas, United States",Old Hags / Night Attacks / Sleep Paralysis,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Old Hags / Night Attacks / Sleep Paralysis :: Hands on my Shoulder

I t started when I woke up thirsty and needed something to drink so I could go back to sleep. I started to move and all that moved was my head, I then noticed that there were hands on my shoulder that felt strong, strong enough to hurt me if they wanted to. I laid my head back down and started thinking and when I did, every hair on the back of my neck and all the way down my back stood up like I had been shocked by something. I then, with all my strength, threw myself up and the hands lifted me, restraining me, but also pushing me as if it wanted to give me a sign, but it let go and that's all that happened.

A couple of years ago, I was sitting on my porch and got the same feeling, when I looked up there was a dog walking towards me with blood red eyes and I blinked to see if was real, and when I blinked, it was standing 3 maybe 4 feet from me. The weird thing was that the dog was 20 feet away before I blinked. I blinked again and it vanished before my eyes.

I now belief deeply in ghosts but have never thought I would be actually touched by one.

My Aunt Mai and the Neglected Boy,Lao People's Democratic Republic,Misc,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Misc :: My Aunt Mai and the Neglected Boy

T his is an old story that happened a long time ago back in Laos. This was the story that happened to my aunt, my mom's sister. My aunt Mai was the eldest unwed girl in her village at the age of 17. So she was the mother figure to a lot of the children in the neighborhood. There was a young boy at the age of 6 that Mai took care of day in and day out, because his parents were constantly arguing and violence was involved. Divorce is considered to be a disgrace and one would rather die than have a divorce back then.

One night, the little boy ended up at Mai's front door, shivering. Mai took him in and warmed the boy up. The boy said his parents were arguing all night, then it was silent and he noticed that he was home alone. Now these were not regular insulated homes, the homes, back then, were just huts made of banana leaves and twigs. The entire village must have heard them arguing that night, but ignored it. Morning came and the boy's parents still did not come to claim the boy. Mai took the boy next door to his house and knocked on the door, yet no one opened. Night came and Mai heard voices coming from the little boy's house. So she took the boy and went next door. She kicked the door open and to her surprise she saw another woman in the arms of the boy's father. Mai apologized for intruding but explained the reason why she was there - to bring his son home.

Days turned into weeks, no one in the village heard or seen of the boy's mother since that night. The mother's parents came to the house demanding to speak with their daughter but the boy's father would say she had left with another man. The village knew the mother was not the type to do such a thing, and gossips filled the community that he had murdered her but there wasn't enough evidence to prove it. The father went around the county with his new bride, leaving his only son to Mai to take care of. The boy was not sad, did not mention he missed his mother, nor did he shed a tear for her... Mai got concerned.

One morning, Mai went to pick up the boy from his house. The boy came out of the house, waved in the direction of his father - his father who wasn't looking at him - and came out of the house with a smile. Mai asked him why he was so happy. He said his mother is taking him away from here. Mai was confused, she asked, ""Where IS your mother?"" The little boy replied, ""Dad loves her a lot now, every day he carries her on his back."" Mai's mouth dropped. The boy said, ""Just look at them, aren't they happy"" as he looked into the house toward his father. Mai looked inside, she only saw the father's back turned facing them with his new wife cooking - no sign of the mother.

My aunt said a week after that the little boy mysteriously passed away. Some said it was due to an illness that he contracted and since they lived in the rural, nothing could save him but my aunt said it was because his mother came to get him away from his horrible father.

School Ghost,"Wisconsin, United States",Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: School Ghost

Y ou always hear about kids who died in your school and you don't believe it. One day a boy told me that a girl named Leslee died in the gym on the stage. No one knows how. I didn't believe it, until I experienced my first ghost sighting.

My friends Alicia, Briana and I went on the stage at noon recess to practice for the talent show. Because we have a school singing group for us three. When on stage, we thought we should close the curtains, so no one could watch us. As Briana walked over to close it, IT STARTED TO GO ABOUT A REALLY LITTLE BIT BY ITSELF! Then the colored lights kept on switching on and of. We were way too scared to run of. ""The story of Leslee must be true!"" shouted Alicia. Then we went to hide behind all of these big mats. As we did, the lights went off. Then we peeked our heads to see what happened, the curtains were closed all the way now. We came out and Briana was crying. Alicia was breathing big, and I clanged onto my friends. Then one of the mats came over to fall on us. We shouted and ran.

We still go on the stage to practice, the day that happened was April 10, 2007. But we keep the curtains open. We try not to mess around with the ghost, or whatever it is, but we never run away when Leslee tries to pull another prank on us. Who knows she could be nice. But I am not taking any chances. She tried to hurt us. And that is nothing we asked for. Still Leslee creeps us out. We didn't tell any kids or teachers. Only our moms!

Remember if a ghost tries to hurt you, don't try to be scared. It gives the ghost more power.

The Lady in the Basement,"Michigan, United States",Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: The Lady in the Basement

I moved to a new house nine months ago to stay with a friend of the family while I was going to college. The house seemed mostly normal, aside from a few bumps in the night, until about a month ago. The first thing happened when I was sleeping. The woman I live with (who doesn't believe in ghosts) woke me up to ask me if I had turned the television on. I hadn't used the television in a few days as I don't really watch that much television and it was a completely random occurrence, so the tv couldn't have been set on a timer or it would have been turning on and off at the same time every day. So we dismissed it for the time and went to bed.

A few days later I was cleaning the house when I heard a woman singing. There was no radio on and I was the only person in the house. I went to see what it was and realized it was coming from the basement area. I stood next to the basement door and listened for a minute. After a few seconds, I heard footsteps coming up the stairs from the basement! I opened the basement door and there was no one there. Shortly after that (maybe a half hour later), I was eating lunch and the television turned on and then off. I sort of just disregarded it because it wasn't THAT big of a deal and I love the paranormal! A few seconds later, a woman's voice started talking in the back bedroom so I went to see if maybe the tv was on and it wasn't. There was no one in the room and I was home alone.

I called my mom to talk to her about it so I wouldn't feel creeped out. After that, not much happened for a few days and then about a week and a half later, I was cleaning the bedrooms and waiting for my friend to call. She said she would call around noon so I said OKAY and just cleaned while I waited. It was about 1:00pm and I decided to call her to see what she was doing. She said she had called and someone had picked up the phone and she could hear a tv in the background and then the phone was hung up. I thought maybe she had gotten the wrong number and she said she would hang up and hit redial because nobody had made any phone calls since then.

A few seconds later my phone rang. I was on the phone with her and I happened to walk by the basement door and I heard voices so I went down the stairs and found the basement television on. There is a phone in the basement of my house because my roommate's son used to stay down there so she put a phone in for him. Someone answered my phone from the basement and I was the only person in the entire house. The television in the basement had also not been used for AT LEAST a couple weeks and was definitely not set on a timer and the remote was on the shelf.

I think a woman stays in my basement. She sings sometimes and I hear her walk around. I like her though and she is friendly. Ghosts don't have to be scary! She is nice and she has a pretty singing voice. Sometimes I go downstairs and talk to her but nothing happens. Then when I go back upstairs she'll start making noise.

Jack in the Box,"Illinois, United States",Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: Jack in the Box

I was young when I had my first child, 18. Every night, like all babies, mine would cry. I would get up and either hold my child, get a bottle, or change her diapers. Something to make her stop crying. After awhile, when my baby would cry in the middle of the night, a toy that had to be wined up in order to play would start. The toy was one of my baby's favorites. My baby then would get very happy and stop crying. The toy was one of those old ones. You had to crank the wheel really hard in order for it to play. Turning it until it clicked and then it played until it clicked again. You could hear it cranking every time my baby would cry. Then play and play until it clicked. This went on for several nights, until me and my family moved out.

My mother always told me that the house was haunted, saying she saw things. I never had an experience before until up to this point, I never believed there was a ghost in our home. After this started to happen, I seemed to never really care. It wasn't anything bad. Like all experiences, I was startled at first, but after I while I was thankful that he or she was a nice ghost. After all, he or she probably just wanted to get some sleep too.

Ghostbusters at the Old Historical City Cemetery - Sacramento,"California, United States",Ghost Hunting,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Ghost Hunting :: Ghostbusters at the Old Historical City Cemetery - Sacramento

I t's April 7, 2007, Saturday.  The time is 10:00 a.m.  H.P.I. (Haunted and Paranormal Investigations) of Northern California take claim to this cemetery on this day for about a couple of hours!   On this sort of cloudy gloomy day, H.P.I. Paranormal Investigators entered the main gate of this old historical cemetery on Broadway in downtown Sacramento.  We have a good turn-out, the investigators are: Shannon McCabe/President/Lead Investigator;  Tim Hawkins; Wendy Smith (Shannon's mom); Carol Gillis; John Wachter aka Vlawde/Lead Investigator; Kristen Sheley/Researcher; Paul Dale Roberts/Ghost Writer; Julie English; Cherie Vincente; Jennifer Baca; Anusha Wickramasinghe; Michelle Paykel; Emily McCarthy; Dandamudi Veerendranadh aka Vee.

There is a historian at this outing and he relates all kinds of historical information about this cemetery, which can be found at this site: http://www.oldcitycemetery.com/   I will give you a quick history lesson.  The cemetery was established in 1849 and some of the people that are buried at this cemetery died in the 1850 Cholera Epidemic outbreak.  We noted many graves are marked by the secretive organization known as the Freemasons.  I'm a Rosicrucian (A.M.O.R.C. Antiquus Mysticusque Ordo Rosae Crucis) - Key Number 5000030 - Member since 2001, so of course I took interest to this.  One tombstone reads: The Founder of the Order of the Native Sons of the Golden West - General A.M. Winn Born: 4/27/1810 - Died: 8/26/1883.  The Sutter family is buried at this historical cemetery also.

This is the 3rd time I have been to this cemetery.  The first time was when I went on the Halloween Twilight Tour with a psychic.  The psychic saw many entities near and around the cemetery.  She told the group that there was 3 women by a tree and that if we placed our hands into the area where the ghostly women were, we would be able to feel something.  So I tried it and I felt a rubbing movement on my hand.  My son Jason and ex-wife Patricia tried placing their hands in the same area and they felt a coldness.  The second time I went to this cemetery was with my black Chow T-Rex and my Jack Russell Terrier Pika.  Pika came to an area of the cemetery and was barking like crazy, he wouldn't stop.  He was barking at plain air, while T-Rex laid down and ignored the barking.  I believe Pika may be an intuitive.

Well, here I am again, my 3rd time around, this time with H.P.I.  Since it's daytime, I figured we were not going to encounter any ghosts.  So I decided to ask some of the investigators their experiences with the paranormal.  Here is what some of them had to say.

Cherie Vincente:  One time she did an investigation at Mt. Vernon Cemetery and was using her EVP (Electronic Voice Phenomenon) monitor to see if she could pick up ghostly voices.  She felt like an entity followed her home.  The entity actually touched her on the neck.  Her second encounter was because a woman died of a drug overdose behind her home.  Because of her size, they had a hard time getting her out of the house.  She had been dead for 3 days in her home.  After the woman died, Cherie saw a clear shimmering image and her TV would go into static mode.  Could this been the dead woman who died in the home behind her house?

Jennifer Baca:  ""When I lived in Michigan, my ex-sister-in-law and I did a seance and I felt like we summoned a spirit guide named 'White Feather', an Indian woman.  Once when I was taking a nap, I felt a brushing against my hair.  This happened to me twice.""

Tim Hawkins: ""When I lived in Carmichael, California, I lived with a ghost, that I called 'Melvin'.  Melvin would visit my house guests.  He would open the door and check on my guests.  Once he threw a picture.  I once heard crying in another room and there was no one there.  There was this strange column of odor, that smelled like a burning smell, it moved around the house, I chased the column of odor around the house until it dissipated.  Sometimes there were missing objects in the house.""

Anusha Wickramasinghe: ""While in Sri Lanka, I always felt presences in my home.  I am a Buddhist and we have strong beliefs in reincarnation.  I am considered a 'sensitive', because I can feel certain things.  When I was at Mather A.F.B., I once felt a spirit walking behind me, I heard a spirit's voice call my name.  My mother at Mather A.F.B. once saw a man in white and the ghostly entity walked away.  When my mother went to investigate, there was nothing there.""

Michelle Paykel:  ""When I was 8 years old, my grandpa died.  I felt like my grandpa would check on me and my sister.  There was once a glowing figure at the door, this occurred after he had died.  This happened in Carmichael.  My daughter saw my father's ghost sitting on the front porch, she was 2 years old at the time.""

John Wachter aka Vlawde:  ""When I was young, from age 4 to age 7, I would hear my name called out.  I would see if my parents were calling me, but it wasn't them.  When I got older, the name calling stopped.""

Kristen Sheley:  ""When I lived in Oregon, I played around with an Ouija Board.  I asked for the entity to make his or her presence known and the smoke detector went off.  Never played with an Ouija Board again.""

Emily McCarthy:  ""When I was in high school, my sister and I lived in a house in East Sacramento, somewhere by 40th and R Street.  The house, a small brick house was built in the 1920s or 1930s.  The doorbell of this home would ring on its own.  Sometimes there were knockings on the door and no one was there.  My mother saw a woman in a nightgown and she thought it was me.  She actually saw a ghostly woman's figure in a nightgown.  Sometimes in this house, the lights went on and off on it's own accord.  We lived in this house in 1999 to the year 2000.  When my sister told her teacher about this house, the teacher was familiar with the stories of this haunted home.""

Paul Dale Roberts:  Well, let me put my two cents in.  When I lived in San Bruno, I heard stories about the Daly City Cemetery.  I have been to this cemetery and I never witnessed anything.  But, this cemetery was legendary.  There were many graverobbings, because grave robbers would steal the jewelry from the graves.  The Chinese have a tendency of placing valuable jewelry and money into the graves of their loved ones.  People saw ball lightning flying around the tombstones.  Legend has it two lovers parked their car and a blue glowing disc landed in the graveyard and the boyfriend went to investigate and never came back.  The girl got into the driver's side of the vehicle and drove like crazy to get out of the graveyard and she claimed a Bigfoot creature jumped from the gated arch onto the hood of her boyfriend's car.  Legend has it that the girl was last known to be in a mental ward in Napa.  Her boyfriend was never seen again and the police thought the girl had murdered her boyfriend and did not believe her lunatic ramblings.  So the story goes...

We had a meeting at The Old City Cemetery and Shannon related about the upcoming Northern California Paranormal Conference that will be held at the Brookdale Lodge in Brookdale, California.  Special guest is psychic Nancy Bradley.

Shannon discussed the soon-to-be-released H.P.I. comic book.  H.P.I. Meets Dracula.  Artist is Mike Henderson (former founder of H.P.I.), writer is Paul Dale Roberts and Letterer is Warren Montgomery (former letterer of the comic book Razor).  John Wachter aka Vlawde has created a H.P.I. radio site, various H.P.I. members can host the show or be guests on the show and may discuss their paranormal experiences.  Tim Hawkins talked about a possible field trip investigation on the U.S.S. Hornet.  Shannon elaborated that maybe sometime in the future we can go out-of-state for an investigation.  Places that people mentioned that we could investigate was the Bell Witch Haunting in Tennessee, Elvis Presley Mansion, New Orleans.  Kristen Sheley said 'let's take it further, let's go overseas, like England!'  A note to Kristen, Carol Gillis and I have both been to the Tower of London, one of the most haunted places in London!  Another eerie place in England that I personally visited was Stonehenge.  England is overrun by ghosts!  But, that's my thoughts on the matter!

Now as we were all leaving the cemetery, we were missing one investigator.  Some of us were concerned.  Did this investigator meet up with some unknown force?  Was she consumed by a portal that took her into an unearthly dimensional realm?  Was she being held captive at a mausoleum by the undead?  Did we need to do a search and rescue for this investigator?  The investigator Julie English wasn't missing at all.  She was riding around in a motorized Sheriff cart with her arm around the deputy.  That Julie, she's a real card!  Geesh!   For more about H.P.I. check out their web site at:

Stop It Sammy,"Wisconsin, United States",Poltergeists / Physical Manifestations,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Poltergeists / Physical Manifestations :: Stop It Sammy

I lived by myself for now about 2 years. I have a dog who likes to pull stuff around. I have a big bed with lots of covers. I usually look forward to bed time. One night, I was nearly asleep, when the bed started to shake. ""SAMMY!"" I shouted, that was my dog's name. The shaking stopped. Then it came back. I kept on calling Sammy as the night went on. The covers came off from me and this time I was mad. ""COME HERE SAMMY!"" I shouted. Sammy jumped on the bed with me. He licked me and curled up in a ball. Then the shaking came around an hour later. I sat up and looked around, it was midnight. But the shaking did not stop. I still looked around, SAMMY WAS ON THE BED! ""WHO IS THERE!"" I shouted. Then it stopped. I continued to call ""WHO IS THERE?"".

I laid down and tried to ignore the shaking. Then it stopped for 15 min. I heard something fall in my closet. I fell asleep later that night. I called the lady who sold me the house that same week. This is her comment. ""My dear, did I not tell you, a 5 year old kid died in the house. He loved to shake the bed and pull the covers. It drove the mother crazy. Also, he would make stuff fall in the closets. So, good luck with your new... child"".

I had the child in my house for a long time, yet not all nights he comes. I try to treat him nice, but lately he drives me nuts.

Cell Phone Apparition,"California, United States",Photographs / Videos / EVP,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Photographs / Videos / EVP :: Cell Phone Apparition

T his occurred last Saturday night on April 7th, 2007 (night before Easter). My 15 year old daughter Sydney was watching the DVD ""Borat"" with two of her friends. My husband and I were in the next room. She had seen the movie a couple times and was trying to film funny scenes with her video cell phone. The phone will film for about 15 seconds before shutting off. She filmed a couple scenes and nothing was out of the ordinary. Then as she filmed the following clip, she could see a black floating object through her phone screen but did not see it as she glanced at the TV. Her friends were talking to her and watching the movie as she sees this ""thing"" floating in front of the TV on her phone. My daughter is perplexed and can be heard saying ""What the h..."" at the end. She took another film after and it was normal.

What I see is a 3-D floating object that seems to have a face lying sideways in the upper left of the object. Another strange thing are the red lights on top of the TV. We have no electronics on top of the TV and the only red light is the on/off button at the bottom. When I looked at the before and after clips she took, there were no red lights on top of the TV.

I have had some strange experiences in this house in the eight years we've lived here. Once, I was vacuuming and a mesh soccer bag came out of nowhere and landed in front of me. In irritation, I said my daughter's name thinking she had done it, only to look up and see her outside playing. There was no one else home. Another time, I was home alone with my cat working on the computer upstairs. I heard the sound of a bell tinkling and a noise, like a cat tumbling. My cat was in my lap and there were no others in the house. The cat looked like it had seen a ghost and wouldn't come downstairs for a while. I have also seen a doorknob jiggle with no one (real) on the other side.

I spoke with a woman who rented our house before we bought it. I called her about some mail of hers we kept getting over the years and out of the blue she said ""You know that house is haunted"". We live in an area that was inhabited by Chumash Indians so she said she had an Indian Spiritual Leader come through the house. He or she said something about this house being very active with negative energy. I don't feel it's negative, but I do feel there is something.

Can anyone recommend a researcher I can send the video to for analysis?

Ghost in the Mirror,"Wisconsin, United States",Apparitions / Voices / Touches,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Apparitions / Voices / Touches :: Ghost in the Mirror

O ne day my child came home from school and he told me he found a ghost game that you play with a mirror. But I didn't believe in ghosts that time. So that night, when he had his friend sleep over, they both went into the bathroom to play the game. While they played, I heard some creaking sound around the house. Our house was very old so I'm use to those kinds of sounds. Later that night, they said that they saw a ghost in the mirror. Of course, I didn't believe them, but they wanted me to play. So I was forced to play the game with them.

We all went into the bathroom and turned off the lights. A minute later, I looked in the mirror. So shocked to see someone or something was coming after us! I reached for the light but it was too dark to see where the switch was. When I finally found the switch, the lights automatically turned on! The boys where frozen with fear and the mirror was shattered to pieces! I have never felt so scared in my entire life! My child will never play that game again! And the scariest part is our house is old.

Green Orb,"Maryland, United States",Orbs / Lights / Mists,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Orbs / Lights / Mists :: Green Orb

I t was a normal night, 10 years ago. I was spending the night in my grandparent's house (as I often did), and it was time to go to bed so I did. I don't know the exact time, but it was in the middle of the night, I awoke to see a ""green ball"" floating in the living room. The room was cold, but not really cold. Being 4 years old at the time, I didn't know what it was, but I knew that it wasn't something normal. I tried to wake up my grandfather, but it was no use, he slept through my attempts at trying to wake him up. I looked back at the ""green ball"" floating in the entry way to my grandmother's room of old stuff. It didn't move, but it had a odd ominous glow to it. I walked slowly into my grandmother's room while keeping a sharp eye on the orb, I can't help but feel as if it were staring at me.

I slept in my Grandmother's room for the night. I checked the room out the following day, there was a old decorative bird house hanging in the place where the orb had been. No one could explain what I saw was, even I can't seem to find a reasonable explanation. To this day, I've been researching ghosts, demons, etc, hoping to find out how this orb appeared in a place with no signs of hauntings or use of Ouija boards. I've concluded that it was a haunted object (the birdhouse), because several days before the night of the sighting, I had nightmares of small houses with demonic red lights within them.

Walker Valley,"Washington, United States",Misc,"L ast summer, my step dad and I went to this one dirt biking pit called ""Walker Valley"" in Washington State. When we got there, it was a Wednesday morning and there weren't that many people around at all, except for a few bikers here and there. It turns out that my step dad and I were the only ones using the main dirt path. I guess it wasn't a very busy day there. My dad and I were riding our dirt bikes up and down these small dirt hills, and he was a few feet ahead of me. As I was following him, my bike started slowing down and the engine was sputtering. I kept on twisting the throttle handle, but it wouldn't speed up. Suddenly my bike came to a complete stop, and I had to pull over on the side. My step dad didn't stop or even look around because I guess he either didn't know that I had stopped or he didn't want to wait for me.

So I was alone. I used the kick start, and my bike sputtered again, but wouldn't start up. I kick started it again and this time I noticed that there was a really weird smell coming from the tail pipe, as well as a really dark colored smoke every time I tried to start it. I looked into the tail pipe, thinking there was something in there, but it was perfectly clear. So I kick started my bike a few times again, and finally it started. I caught up with my dad, and we rode around for a few more hours, but my bike kept on acting strange and it even came to a stop one more time.

Later in the afternoon, we left Walker Valley and headed home. When we got home, my dad went inside to use the bathroom while I was taking my bike down from the back of the truck. I pulled it into the garage and started giving it a full inspection because I wanted to see what was wrong with it. When I opened the side hood to look into the engine, I was shocked and disgusted at what I saw. There was thick brown hair entangled all over the engine. There was some smoke and a nasty burning smell. I was really surprised because before we left for the park, I looked at the engine and there was no hair at all. Now as I was staring at this hair, it looked like it had REALLY wound itself up in there pretty good. This was obviously what had been causing my bike trouble. I picked it out (and I was really disgusted), and it took me like 20 minutes to get it all out.

After I got all the burnt hair out, I threw it away in the trash. I then went inside and asked my mom if she knew anything about the hair; her hair was almost the same color as the one in my bike. She looked at me weird and said she hadn't even been near it. Besides, her hair is short, like a guy's. I was tired so I took a long nap in my room.

When I woke up, it was night, so I wanted to take a shower before I went back to sleep. When I went in the shower, I started washing my hair, and as I was rinsing my hair out, I looked down and saw some long brown hair sticking out of the drainage hole and some of it was on my feet and tangled into my toes. I screamed really loud and almost slipped. I got out of the shower really fast and ran out of there and into my room naked, wet, and shivering. I was SO scared. It couldn't have possibly been my hair because I'm blond, and my step dad is bald.

My mom came running up the stairs and asked me what was wrong. I said nothing. I just went to bed and tried to sleep. The next morning, I cautiously went into the bathroom and looked in the tub. The hair was gone. I've never told anybody, except for now when I found this site. I still can't explain exactly what happened, and fortunately, it hasn't happened again. I'm still kind of scared to take showers (but I still DO take them), but hopefully I'll get over what happened and move on with my life.

Grinning Lady,Philippines,Apparitions / Voices / Touches,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Apparitions / Voices / Touches :: Grinning Lady

A ctually this story happened to my mom. It was during the 60's, when she was still sleeping with her brothers and sisters in one house. They have inherited a big house from my grandfather (he was a doctor), so having a couple of her cousins sleeping over is not a problem. Their house was built near a river with a wooden bridge over it (you'll know what the wooden bridge is about later on my story).

Here's where her story begins. All of them came home late from a party (back in the 60's parties were great and being invited to one means you are popular), they were all tired and decided to call it a night and went to their own rooms. My mom was staying with 2 of her sisters in one room. Her bed was located right beside a big window that's made out of wood and would just open from the middle then the shatters will just slide from side to side. That night, due to excessive drinking, my mom woke up because she needs to go to the bathroom. So she went and went back to bed. When she was about to doze off, she could feel something or someone was watching her. She opened her eyes and she saw a lady with long black hair outside their window, she was also wearing a black dress and her eyes were red. The lady was staring at her with a creepy grin on her face. My mom couldn't move. The scary part of it was my mom's room was located at the second floor; in short the lady was floating. She tried to call her sisters but they could not hear her. She felt so scared and just covered her self with her quilt. After a few minutes, she tried to check if the lady was gone but when she peeped out of her quilt, the lady was still there, staring and grinning at her. She just decided to just hide herself under quilt and eventually she had fallen asleep.

The next day, everybody went down for breakfast. My mom did too, even though she was tired due to what happened that night. She did not try to tell everybody because they would just think that she was dreaming. Then a guy cousin of her came out looking as if he hadn't slept all night and just freaked out on them saying that he saw a lady outside their window (the boy's bedroom was located on the first floor). Then he described what he saw, my mom realized that he was describing the same lady she saw outside her window. So she decided to tell them on what happened to her that night. Most of them were skeptical.

Later that week, my mom was just about to get in their house when she saw a big commotion beside the wooden bridge. There were a lot of people looking over with the police too. She saw that her cousin was one of the spectators. When he saw her, he just ran to her and said that somebody found a sack with a dead girl inside. Later in the news, they post a picture of the girl and it was the lady my mom and uncle saw. They did believe them now.

Am I Being Targeted?,Australia,Poltergeists / Physical Manifestations,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Poltergeists / Physical Manifestations :: Am I Being Targeted?

O ver the last few months, strange things have been happening here. The first sign of something out of the ordinary was when I woke up one morning to find my bedroom door locked from the outside, with the inside being unlocked. When I go to bed, it's the other way around, as logically, I can't lock the door on the outside, while I'm standing inside.

I got home from work one night, the next week, to discover this time that the door was locked inside, and unlocked outside, completely opposite of how I'd left it. And now this. As I type this, my dog is going berserk, barking, scratching and sniffing at my bedroom door, where 2 hours ago, an unseen something slammed the door hard against my hand as I reached in to turn the light off.

I've only been living in this house for a little under 2 years, and my current room for just over 2 months. My sister lived in there the whole time before I moved my stuff in, and she says she never experienced anything unusual.

My Old Pup,Bahamas,Pets / Animals,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Pets / Animals :: My Old Pup

M y sister Emma and me, Alicia, always wanted a puppy. Emma was about six, and I was eight or nine. My parents went on a vacation in the United States (Florida). When they got back and opened the door, they had a baby golden retriever. I was shocked. THEY BROUGHT HOME A PUPPY! Not even a year with him, he tripped over one of our wood shop tools, and broke his back leg. Every night after his surgery, he would sit under the table and cry. If you tried to pet him, he would bite. He was in so much pain.

After about two weeks he died. For the first week, no one talked. But at night, we would always hear this strange dog cry. My mom and dad would search for the noise. Then they heard it come from under the table! We figured out that it was the ghost of our puppy. At night, sometimes, you would feel something jump on your bed and it would sink. We treat the ghost nicely. Even now, he still growls. But sometimes, you would not even notice him.

Now at 23, I bought the house that I used to live in. The last people who lived there said there was NO ghost dog. But when I moved in that house, the puppy returned. My old pup.

Barn Ghost 2,"Wisconsin, United States",Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: Barn Ghost 2

Y ou may of read Barn Ghost . People told me to keep on writing if anything happens. Well last night, April 10, 2007, I woke up to a cry ""HELP ME HELP ME!"". I jumped out of bed. My sons ran in by me. ""Mom what happened?"" Eathen asked. He is 11 years old. Andy who is now 9, was hugging me. ""Who is that?"" asked Eathen. I got out of bed and put on my robe. I got on my boots and my family followed me. We ran into the barn.

It was late, so we did not run fast because we were tired. We ran back where we last saw the ghost. I held Andys hand and Eathen was being held by David. ""HELP ME HELP ME!"" the ghost kept crying. We did not see her, but Casper, another cat, even strays, were in a pack, hissing at the last spot when we saw the ghost.

The next morning I ran the kids to school, my boys were freaked so they each got to have a friend come over after school. Around 7 p.m. me and David went to feed the animals. The cats were still around in that spot. Some laying down. Some hissing, some meowing. ""Here kitty kitty kitty"" I heard a voice say. I backed up with fear. All the cats got in there pack and started hissing. ""Knock it of..."" I told the cats ""DAVID COME HERE!"" I shouted. I ran out of the barn to find my husband.

David and I ran in the barn with fear. We saw all the cats hissing. Then we saw the little girl. She waved and disappeared. This time she was hard to see. We went inside to the children. And around midnight, we heard the little girl cry ""HELP ME HELP!"".

Young Girl Saying Hi,"Virginia, United States",Apparitions / Voices / Touches,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Apparitions / Voices / Touches :: Young Girl Saying Hi

T his didn't happen recently. It happened a couple of years back at close to mid night. I shared a room with my sister so I was happy when she said she was staying the night at my cousins. When she's not home, I like to stay up late and just watch movies and listen to my radio. I had just finished watching a movie and decided it was time to go to bed.

I went to the kitchen and got me something to drink. I was fine at the time but I couldn't get over the fact that it felt as if someone was following me. I was 12 at the time and I had heard about a incident where my brother had woke up and saw a man sitting in our chair in the living room. Everyone else was asleep. With me being kind of young I didn't believe it so I put the feeling aside. Since I'm the kind of person who has to hear things in order to go to sleep, I decided I wanted to adjust the radio to a station I liked.

As I was standing in front of my mirror, I heard a little girl behind me say ""hi..."" at that moment, I turned around and saw no one standing there. I was scared to death and I started to believe what my brother said. I went to bed but kept the light on all night.

The next day when my sister came home, I told her what had happened to me. She told me that the girl had also spoken to her but in the kitchen. To this day, I won't go to bed without a little light being on. I also have to have my radio on and a movie playing.

A Christmas Visitor,"Virginia, United States",Apparitions / Voices / Touches,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Apparitions / Voices / Touches :: A Christmas Visitor

A bout 8 years ago, when I was 5 (I am now 13), I lived in this house which was believed to be haunted. Since I was so young, I didn't really believe this stuff because at that age, kids sometimes think what people tell you are mad up. Just a joke to scare you.

It was Christmas Eve and everything was normal. I went to bed early so that Santa could come to my house faster. I laid awake in bed thinking about all the neat presents I would be getting the next day. I thought about all the toys, pretty clothes, candy and other cool stuff kids get for christmas. I discovered that by thinking about all this caused me to gain no progress in getting to sleep. So, I pushed the excitement aside and soon fell asleep.

That morning, I woke up and like every normally kid, realized that it was christmas morning and jumped out of bed as fast as I could. I then ran to my parents bedroom (where they were still sound asleep) and woke them up shouting ""Wake up! Its Christmas!"" They sleepily crawled out of bed and told me to go on to the living room.

While they went to the bathroom to help themselves wake up, I was anxiously waiting near the tree, staring at all my presents. I knew I couldn't open a present until my parents told me I could, so I just tried to guess what I had gotten. I then walked over to the couch and sat impatiently. At that moment, in front of me, I saw the apparition of a 15 year old girl holding one of MY presents. She then held it out to me and said ""Here you go. Open it..."" When I told her no, she put it back under the tree.

At that moment, my parents walked into the room and she disappeared. When I told my parents what I saw, they didn't believe me.

School Is Full of Ghosts,"Colorado, United States",Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: School Is Full of Ghosts

M y school has a very interesting past. A few years before my school was on the lot where it is now, the lot belonged to a Psychiatric hospital. And before that, it was a tuberculosis hospital. The school itself is separated into 6 different buildings. The Library (which was once the church), the admin building (which was where the morgue was), the high school building (was where they kept the lock down patients in the Psychiatric hospital), the middle school (was the cafeteria), the art building (was the place where the staff went on break) and the drama department (was the sun room in the TB hospital).

There are lots of freaky stories about the school grounds and there isn't a person in or around school who hasn't seen, felt, or heard strange things.

On the first day of school, in august one, of my teachers said that when they bought this lot for the school. They had to knock down the 7th building (that's now the baseball field) because doors kept locking, the power wouldn't work, and people were constantly feeling sick. He also told us that in the Admin building, all the phones would ring simultaneously for a few seconds and then stop. I never really took any mind to this and I always thought that the teachers were just messing with my mind. And up until a few months ago, nothing strange had happened. But one day when I was helping our school librarian something DID happen.

I was sitting at the check out counter in the library when a middle school girl came in. She walked around for a while when suddenly I heard a book drop right next to the girl. I watched her for a few minutes as she kept throwing books on the ground, ""Aren't you going to pick those up?"" I asked. She looked over at me and shook her head no. ""Well, why not?"" I asked, ""I'm not doing it..."" the girl replied, ""it's the little girl in the funny clothes..."" I began freaking out slightly but the girl didn't seem to mind. She checked out a book and left.

When the librarian came back in, I told her what happened, she smiled, ""Oh, she's harmless. I call her Jenny, she just likes to have fun. Apparently she died in this church years ago..."" I looked at her like she was crazy but I couldn't deny what I or the little girl had seen. As I was leaving the librarian chuckled, ""You should be here at night, there all over the place..."" At that, I ran out the door.

Need Help with Binding Spirit,"Maryland, United States",Old Hags / Night Attacks / Sleep Paralysis,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Old Hags / Night Attacks / Sleep Paralysis :: Need Help with Binding Spirit

I 'm kind of freaked out right now. I was reading a story on here about a person who was paralyzed by a ghost and cannot wake up. As if being held down, and being forbidden from movement. I've never thought of this much, but I've been reading up on the ghosts, demons, angels. Etc. And something hit me. I was having these odd nights were I'd wake up, and I could open my eyes, but cannot move. I remember fighting, struggling to gain control over my body and move. I remember getting a faint control over my fingers, while my body kept trying to tell me to go to sleep. I kept fighting to wake up, most of the time I'd fall back a sleep. I've tried to talk while in this state, but I could only get my lips to move a little bit, but not enough to talk. Every once in a while I'd get the control back, and free myself of the invisible binds. Note that they would only happen at night.

I remember years back setting on the counter in the kitchen by the phone, while my parents went out to eat for their special time together, and I'd momentarily call my mom and ask when they would return while trying to hide the worry in my voice. While doing this I'd listen to the cracks and creaks of the house. I don't know if they were spirit activities or what, but I remember the fear. My parents don't do this anymore (thank heaven). When we first moved in, I always thought that were was a ghost in the house. I think I may have been right.

Recently I have awoken in the middle of the night, and had looked over my back. Next to the chinchilla's cage was a shadow being. I dismissed this as a mixture of dream and lack of sleep. I did have a rush of fear, but I quickly feel back a sleep. There also were other cases where a thought I saw a ghost and dismissed them the same.

I want to purify my house of these invaders, please help me. I wear a cross everyday of my life, I love God, and I'm worried right now. So please... Oh please knowledgeable people of this site, bestow upon me the knowledge and strength to banish these demons and send them back to the firey depths of hell. HELP ME!

The Dark Ghost in my Room,"Texas, United States",Old Hags / Night Attacks / Sleep Paralysis,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Old Hags / Night Attacks / Sleep Paralysis :: The Dark Ghost in my Room

O ne of my best friend rented a old very large two story house, with wooden floors and a large stair case entrance in the front and small one in the back. There were around six of us that lived in the house, we had parties all the time there. One night, in the back of the house, some girls started to look up at the windows of the house and did not want to go in, they said they were scared. I said ""it's a big house but nothing bad in there"". I never felt a bad spirit.

Well, we all partied then I went to sleep. I woke up and saw a black shadow on top of me, I looked around in the room and friends were asleep. I saw a black shadow of a face in front of me, and a ringing in my ear, and a buzzing sound. Then I could not move, I could see the shadow and said get off my chest. Then it let me go and floated towards the door, then went through it. I then got up and walked to my friend's bedroom and woke him up and said ""you won't believe what happened"". He said ""you saw the ghost. It watches me every night"".

I freaked out because we partied the night before, at our house. We had a bunch of people over and he woke up out of a deep sleep and I woke him up and he never told me about a ghost at the house. He wakes up looks at me and how scared I was, and it's daylight outside and did not ask me what happened. He just said ""you saw the ghost. It watches me every night, it stands by the door and watches me"".

My jaw dropped, I just could not believe what happened. I always herd marbles rolling on the ceiling and creaks throughout the house after that, but nothing at the house ever happened again like that.

Scary Doll,United Kingdom,Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: Scary Doll

W hen I was Younger, around the age of 13/14 I would go hang around my best friend's (Sophie) house. Now we both loved the idea of ghosts and she told me how her house was actually built on a cemetery. She had told me previously there was a lot of weird happenings at her house, but one day as we sat in her room she told me how one of dolls would switch itself on.

Of course I demanded that she show me. Sophie removed the batteries and attempted to try and get it to move. Now this doll would move and play a tune at the same time but was battery operated. But the doll didn't move. After a while, we gave up and placed it at the far end of the bed by the pillow, while we sat on the floor the other end of the bed. We chatted for awhile when suddenly the doll moved and played its tune (still with the batteries removed), it moved so that its face was looking directly at us! Totally freaked, out we ran out of the room.

The other time, I came round her house, I refused to be left alone with the doll. Of course, she managed to lock me in her bedroom with it and of course it played its tune again. This time I was so scared that I grabbed it and Broke it (Ripped the wiring out).

Many other freaky things happened in that house but she has since moved.

My Bedroom,"Wisconsin, United States",Old Hags / Night Attacks / Sleep Paralysis,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Old Hags / Night Attacks / Sleep Paralysis :: My Bedroom

T he previous house was located on a quiet neighborhood, built just 10 years before my family and I moved in. It was spacious; I had my own room for once. I have younger siblings and everyone with siblings knows; they tend to take your things without asking. I would lock my bedroom door whenever I head to work or school, and even when I'm in bed, just so they won't get their sticky hands on my things.

A couple of months after the move, in one evening, I head to bed earlier than everyone in my family. I also locked my bedroom door. I was asleep for a while but was woken up by my siblings' voices and laughter - it seemed like they were partying in my room. I could also felt my mattress springs going up and down - as if someone was jumping on my bed. I was so tired; I didn't even bother to open my eyes so I yelled, ""Get out, now!"" This continued for a minute or so. I opened my eyes just a little bit and I saw my little sister's face right in front of mine, looking at me while I slept - the lights were also on. Again, I shouted, ""Get out or I'm going to tell mom and dad!"" I heard my little sister giggling but the bed jumping and the talking persisted.

I got so upset, but was still so tired - eyes still closed, I gave her another warning and turned to sleep on my tummy with my pillow over my head. All of a sudden, I felt my entire body go numb and the hair on the back of my neck stood up - I felt a pair of icy hands on the back of my neck. Then my little sister's voice said, ""Wake up.""

I got out of bed immediately with rage like a madwoman, I shouted, ""This is the last straw!"" To my surprise, the room was empty, the lights were off, and I was alone in the bedroom. I knew it wasn't a dream, I was tired but I knew exactly what was going on the entire time.

Daycare Kids See Ghosts,"Oklahoma, United States",Children Who See Spirits,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Children Who See Spirits :: Daycare Kids See Ghosts

I own a home daycare. One day after lunch, one of my daycare kids, who was 4 at the time, was walking out of our hall bathroom. She ran in the living room and told me that there was a ghost in the hall and it was a little girl. She said the little girl was chasing her and that she ran away and the little girl gave up chasing her. Then she walked into the ""play room"" and told me that there was a man out there. I was the only one in the house with the kids at the time. I asked her what the man's name was and she told me that his name was Martin. Some time in the 80's a man died in this house. His last name just happened to be Martin. I have never said anything to the kids about Mr. Martin, so there is no way that she could have known about Mr Martin. The little girl also told me that there was a lady ghost with the man and they were about to kiss.

About a year or so before this happened, the same little girl was playing with another little girl, only there was no one else in the room.

My 18 year old daughter has seen things also. She has walked through the living room and has seen a black fog floating in the air, near the room where Mr Martin died. She has also seen someone standing in the hall by the bathroom. My dog will stand in the door way of my bed room and bark into the hallway for no reason at all. My 16 year old son was sitting at the computer one night and, out of the corner of his eye, saw a shadow walk past him. He was the only one in the room at the time.

There have been quite a few ""strange"" things happen in this house, one night I was watching an OU Sooner's football game on TV, someone or something changed the channel on the TV. I was in the house alone.

Spirits Use Computers?,"Illinois, United States",Misc,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Misc :: Spirits Use Computers?

T his is getting worse by the day. This all started about two weeks ago when my oldest daughter and her friend decided that they wanted to use a Ouija Board at my house, and my girlfriend gave them her board. They were playing with it and giggling and having some fun with it, but then I got on it. Now I have to preface this story with the fact my girlfriend said she has been messed with by something in that house before. Pictures I have turned down have somehow been moved to face up several times, but I didn't really think anything of it.

So I get on the board. My father passed when I was three and my cousin/best friend died last year so I was of course trying to talk to them. The board responded and I got a little freaked out by the whole situation and so I put the board outside. Now after this, Emily (my girlfriend) was taking a shower and heard something makes ""ugh ugh"" noises at her and it wasn't me.

Now on Saturday, she was at the house alone, I was at work and we were IMing each other when she said the furnace started banging and the door downstairs started trying to open. So she left and we ignored it. On Sunday, her and my oldest daughter burned the Ouija board. So this past Tuesday, her daughter's dad comes to pick her up and we were IMing each other and as soon as she leaves, noises start coming through my speakers at work, so I told her to get out of the house but leave your computer open. I asked if anyone was there, then my sister came to her house so they all went back in, nothing happened. Now comes yesterday, we are IMing each other and she leaves the house around 6:00 after her daughter leaves and logs out of her AIM. Take a look at this:

EmlyBrianna is offline and will receive your IMs when signing back in.

EmlyBrianna is offline and will receive your IMs when signing back in.

Mind you, there is no one at the house at 6:35 and she was logged off her AIM. So I called her and was like what the hell is going on. She was tanning. So I keep my AIM on and this is what was next

Now once again, she is not there. I leave my AIM open at work to see if there is any communication between the time I left and get home. So she waits until I get off of work and then, we both go to the house. Both freaked out like you could not believe. So we sit around watching American Idol and at 7:45 pm, she gets an IM on her phone from me from my work saying I am. So we left and come to my work to see if anything had been sent to me from there. I can't find the AIM file but I can tell you exactly what it said

Now mind you at 7:40, we were there and the computer was closed. While we were sitting here at my office, the phone rings at 9:37, now no one is ever calling my office at 9:37, so I answer it and it was a dial tone.

So we have been IMing most of the day and as soon as she gets ready to leave for work at 2:35, she gets an IM from herself saying ""donet"" and I get one from her AIM login saying the same thing. So we are really freaked out and I logged into my AIM at 3:35 to try and find the one from last night and I got another from her computer saying:

I don't know what to do, I was never really one to believe in this stuff but something is trying to communicate with me and I am a little freaked out, not a little, a lot.

Lady with the Horses,"Wisconsin, United States",Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: Lady with the Horses

I have one daughter, her name is Nadine. My husband and I been married for at least three years now, his name is Ian. We bought a farm last month. We thought it was our dream home. We have four horses, two ponys, eleven cows, ten chickens, and lots of cats. Even strays. Nadine would get riding lessons from me. And then Ian would go feed the chickens. His friend Timmy, would come over and they would do half of the farm work. So far, so good. But then comes night.

In the first few weeks, Nadine would sleep with Ian and I. I asked her why she doesn't sleep in her room. She responded and said ""A lady mommy..."" She is only five. I was shocked ""She goes and rides the horses..."" I was still stunned. ""She is a ghost!"" I never once heard any one tell me that they saw a ghost. So that same night, I stayed up with Nadine and we watched t.v in the living room. That is how it all begins. We heard my training horse for Nadine, Kissy, make a really loud noise and it was very close. And the barn is down the field from the house. Nadine ran up to the window. Nadine and I saw Kissy run really fast past. ""THE LADY!"" shouted Nadine. Kissy ran past again this time we saw a ghost on Kissy's back! I ran to wake Ian up.

We went down to the barn that night and saw Kissy in the barn were we put her that night. But every night, we see the ghost in OUR HOUSE. You wake up to a touch, and then you see her by your bedside. Very strange. And our house was just built. Is this really a ghost, or is it a dream. You tell me!

Our Little Haunted Apartment,"Arkansas, United States",Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: Our Little Haunted Apartment

M y husband and I live in Fayetteville with our two small children and we swear our apartment is haunted! We know someone had died here, but we don't know under what circumstances. We have a rather loud upstairs neighbor who stomps around his apartment and bangs everything around. At least we thought so, until we realized that he wasn't even home most the time that the banging was going on. Nobody else lives there. We've also had doors slam shut on us with no explanation. In our son's room, we have a rather heavy toy truck in front of the door so he can't shut it. One day, when I was in the room changing his diaper, I watched the toy truck roll away from the door and into the hallway. Nobody else was even in the house. Then all of the sudden, the door slammed shut. Our front door even opens and closes on it's own. Even when I've locked it. Our children seem to be able to see what's going on because they will both stare at the ceiling, even though there is nothing there, and either start laughing and smiling or scream bloody murder and hold on to me like they are never going to see me again and start crying. My husband and I have also seen flashes of light out of the corner of our eyes that we can't explain.

I don't know what's going on here, but I can't wait until our lease is up!

The Offer,Australia,Demons / Possessions / Exorcisms,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Demons / Possessions / Exorcisms :: The Offer

W ARNING: This story may contain religious bias. My view of the events have been influenced by my religion. Please don't read it if you think you may be offended.

My name is Luke. I am a Christian. The reason I state that first is because I believe this event that happened in my life is because of my faith. If you do not agree with me in that respect, that is fine. And with that, the story begins.

At the age of 20, I received Jesus Christ as my Savior. The denomination I belong to and believe the teachings of is the Independent Baptist movement. Being a Baptist, I believe in angels and devils (although most people would call them demons. I use the word devils because the King James Bible does). I believe in guardian angels and I also believe that devils are drawn to various symbols of the occult.

Shortly after I was saved (Christian term for receiving Jesus as Savior), I began to research the occult. I did this in order to find out more about it so that I could possibly reach people who were caught up with it, as I believe it is a dangerous practice. The following events are factual as far as I remember them and have told them to many people since they occurred.

In 2001, shortly after my salvation, I began to read through various non canon books, mainly in search of information regarding some of the pagan beliefs of Roman Catholicism. The Shepherd of Hermes, the Book of Enoch, Maccabees etc. I didn't really find much of what I was looking for (which I ended up finding later in the Council of Trent, but that story has no ramifications here). I did however, find many things to do with devils and angels, and the judgment of the former. This lead to me researching various people such as Aleister Crowley.

Many people would know Crowley as being one of the main movers and shakers in the New Age movement, along with Westcott, Hort and Blavatsky. To this day, I wish I had never researched these people, in particular, Blavatsky and Crowley. It seems that even mentioning their names draws the interest of other worldly phenomena. I hope that I may manage to type these words out without being consumed with the fear that has previously taken me at times.

During my times of research, I would pray for protection, which thankfully, God provided. However, their are occasions in the Bible where God allows devils to torment His people. Consider Paul the apostle, who was buffeted (or beaten) by a messenger of Satan, allowed by God, in order to keep Paul humble and reliant on God. A Christian cannot be possessed or killed by a devil, but he or she can definitely be tormented and harassed.

The nights are generally warm in Australia. Even in winter, I can usually get away with sleeping only under a sheet or single thin blanket. I had just taken myself to bed after reading more about the occult. I noticed the coldness immediately. Icy. The uneasiness that surrounded me prevented me from taking a foot outside my room into the dark hallway leading to the linen cupboard. I could have easily walked to get more blankets, but I was kept in that bed by fear that night. I sleep with my door open, yet keep all the lights off (I am not afraid of the dark), to allow the air to circulate through my room, otherwise I wake with my nose and throat being very dry. Tonight was no different. As I drifted off into a light sleep, I remembered that I had not talked with God in some time. The uneasiness enveloped me as I attempted to keep myself warm under the single sheet.

I awoke. The light in the living room was on. I heard the sound of a mug being put down onto the breakfast bar. I hear this noise often at night and usually put it down to my mother finishing her hot chocolate before bedtime. I glanced at my watch with the glow in the dark hands. Quarter past one in the morning. Too late for my mother to be awake still. I knew the lights were out when I went to sleep. I can't sleep if they are on. I heard the cup being put down on the bench again. The lights in the living room went out. A chill went down my neck, and once again, I realized the iciness of room I was in. This is where things got scary. And by scary, I mean absolutely terrifying.

The house was silent, which is unusual, since you can usually hear the fridge running, or crickets outside, or SOMETHING, but there was nothing but silence. Despite the silence, I knew that I was about to come face to face with something I had no desire to meet. I waited. The darkness was darker than it had ever been before. I knew that something was moving towards me in the black ocean surrounding me. My heart was racing. It was right in front of me. I couldn't see it, but I could sense that it was there.

Eyes. Open. Teeth. Lips. A Dress. No arms. No legs. Long black hair. Pale, white skin. Beautiful. Terrifying. Girl.

I know what you are thinking. Girl with long black hair and white skin. I must have seen the ring and I am having a nightmare right? Wrong. This was 2001. The ring hadn't come out yet and I had never even seen the asian version of it. This was the real deal.

She stood there, floating in front of me. I knew she would not harm me, but I also knew she was malevolent. The dress was similar to a christening dress that children wear when they are baptized (although, being a baptist, I don't believe that infant baptism is a biblical practice).

More whispering. Hoarse throat, deep, definitely not female. Very guttural.

I awoke. Far out! The entire thing was a dream. A few seconds pass with me gasping for air, relieved that I had been dreaming the entire time. Then I noticed. The light in the kitchen was on. A whisper again.

I waited a second, closed my eyes, and braced for what I could sense was coming. Nothing happened.

I opened my eyes again, and stood up, intending to turn the light off in the kitchen. As soon as I stood up, the light went out. My alarm went off. The timer on the oven in the kitchen went off. The smoke alarms sounded. I frantically smashed at my wall, trying to find the light switch. I hit it but the lights did not turn on. I ran out into the kitchen, which was illuminated in a dull green due to the flashing timer light from the oven, and located the kitchen light. No luck there either. I opened the fridge, hoping to use the light in there, but the light in the fridge was not working. None of the light switches were working.

I ran upstairs, fully intending to wake my parents and tell them that our house is possessed by a devil, but as I got to the top of the stairs, I got a grip of myself. They were awake however, due to all the alarms in the house sounding, and told me that it was a power shortage, and it would be over soon. I walked back down, and went to the front door. We always keep my keys in the door on the inside in the case of a fire, so I knew where they were that night. I opened the door and went outside, and around the side to the main switchboard. Dad is an electrician and has showed me how this works before. I figured, okay, maybe a shortage did happen, or something tripped the lights, and it's all a coincidence.

As I open the switchboard cover, I make a horrifying discovery. ALL of the power is off in the house. The way our house is setup means that if the electrical outlets cause a trip, the lights will still work, or if a light fuse blows, the power outlets still work. In this case, all of the safety switches were in the off position, meaning that NO power at all was going to the house. The kitchen alarm was ringing without any electricity going to it. And it has no battery backup. The smoke alarms do run on batteries, but that doesn't explain why they sounded the same time as the kitchen timer did, without any smoke around.

I proceeded to switch the safety switches back to on. As I switched the last one over, I could hear that the alarms had stopped.

I went back inside, convinced that a devil had just attempted to offer me immediate power, that was physical, tangible, instead of the power that Jesus Christ offers, which is victory over sin and death. I prayed a lot that night for protection.

Haunted Couch,"California, United States",Misc,"W hen my friends moved into their first apartment, they didn't have a lot of furniture, but there was one item left there, a big couch. The thing about this couch was it was haunted, it sounds stupid but it was really a haunted couch. One problem was if you sat on this couch and let your legs hang over the side, you would feel this weird pressure like something tapping you, and then when you looked under, there was never anything there. Then, if you tried to set down something like a beer or a soda it would fall over every time. Plus, there were sometimes these really bizarre scratching noises coming from right under the couch and occasionally a bloodcurdling yowl that would scare anyone.

It got insanely creepy, and my poor friend jenny was sleeping next to the couch on the floor. What she said was that one night she heard really soft breathing coming from right near her head, and then when she looked over, she could see from under the couch these eyes staring right at her. That was when she finally convinced her boyfriend to get rid of the couch.

So jen called me and my other friend to come over and help move the couch, but when we were lifting it someone must have tripped because the couch moved, and something went thump onto the floor. We set it down to investigate, and saw lying there in almost perfect condition the corpse of an old cat with brown and white fur and a cropped tail, that's how perfect the body was we could even see the fur and everything. We buried it out in the yard and that was the end of it. It might not sound really scary but it was an ordeal for these people, because they had the couch for 5 whole months.

Barn Ghost 3,"Wisconsin, United States",Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: Barn Ghost 3

Y ou may of read Barn Ghost 1 and 2 , but last night the little girl returned! Come and join me as you hear the next thriller about my experience with this little girl. BARN GHOST 3!

It was 3:45pm and the kids were just getting done with school. Around 4:30pm they got home. Eathen and Andy ran right to the barn where their dad was. I saw them from the window and I forced myself to go see them. We have two doors to get outside. First, you open a door, go down some steps, another door, you're out. Well, I opened the first door and I saw my white little kitty CASPER! I picked him up and the second door opened. ""HELP ME HELP ME!"" cried a voice. I ran out of the house and laid down casper in the barn. He hissed and ran of. He was scared from me running. Why was Casper in the house? Why did the door open? Why did the ghost come at day time? Why did she want my help? What can I do, I am only human? She's already dead and is already on my nerves.

When I met up with my husband and kids, Eathen had a picture in his hand. Andy ran over by me tugging on my shirt. They showed me the picture. It was the little girl! But she was with another little girl. In the background was blood and a guy with a rope. THEY WERE IN OUR BARN! We ran over to which we now call THE GHOST SPOT, (where the little girl is always )! We saw the rope that was in the picture. Even though it was never there before.

Night came and we were waiting for her return. We heard a huge crash. We got a call from Cascade Police. We live in Cascade WI. Well that's what it said on caller ID. Then we saw the ghost girl. She waved and disappeared. Our t.v went out. (And still is not working now) We heard a voice ""HELP ME HELP ME!"" then we heard a different voice. Hard to hear but we could make out what he said. ""ITS ALL OVER NOW"" Then it was quiet. All we heard was the wind outside.

We went to bed, my boys had sleeping bags and were on the floor. At night, we heard people running around past our door. THE GHOSTS! I thought. Then we all heard crying. It was over and we fell asleep.

Which leaves us to now, April 12, 2007. It is 8:30 p.m now. We don't see any signs of her yet. WAIT, WE HEARD CRYING! I'LL WRITE LATER FOR BARN GHOST 4!

Something at the End of the Bed,Australia,Misc,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Misc :: Something at the End of the Bed

I have two stories for you. When I was around 21, one night while sleeping in my room, I awoke to what felt like something being sucked out of me. When I opened my eyes, I saw a figure floating at the end of my bed, but more vertical across my body. It started to move back and upright. It had no legs, was a pretty big and was a black figure with one of its arms reaching towards me. It's hand was bony but not bone. More elongated then anything. It looked like it had a hood on but I couldn't see any face.

I was freaking out pretty hard and trying to move but couldn't. I was paralyzed by it. After awhile, it slowly started to back away and moved (back first) through my window. I could then move and was freaked out. I stayed up all night and couldn't sleep for a few days. It hasn't happened since.

When I was around 15, I was getting out of my bath tub during the day when I slipped back and started to fall, my head was falling towards the edge of the tub. I remember falling pretty fast and my legs weren't planted on the ground. As I was falling, something what felt like hands pushed on my back and stopped me from hitting my head. It pushed me enough so I could get my footing back. I wasn't freaked out but more surprised and relieved by it.

My Cats Last Goodbyes,United Kingdom,Pets / Animals,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Pets / Animals :: My Cats Last Goodbyes

T hese two stories are about 2 of my cats that died and visited me before moving on. I had my first cat (Tabs) since I was born. Tabs was a very independent cat but would occasionally sleep with me on my bed. However, she liked to sleep under the covers by my legs (annoying). Unfortunately, she died 8 years ago from to much stress after she had an operation on her throat. Bless her, she had crawled under the stairs, fell asleep and never woke up. I was devastated, she was my first pet and the first one to die.

A couple of days after, I was laying in bed ready to sleep when I felt something, of cat size, move up the side of my leg! The duvet actually moved as well. Now at first, I thought I had moved my leg and caused air to flow through, but as I tried to recreate that effect it didn't work. I believe Tabs had come to say her last goodbye.

We bought two kittens after Tabs died (Socks and Whitewash), unfortunately, 2 years ago, socks was hit and killed by a car right outside my house. Again, a couple of days after I was laying in bed reading. When I kept seeing a wisp of black appearing by the side of my bed. It was moving around my bed. Now, when socks was alive she used to walk around my bed going underneath it etc. And you would see her tail or back occasionally just over the top of the edge. Socks was Black.

I believe both my cats came to say goodbye. Because since those incidents, it never happened again.

Mirror Pulled Off The Wall,United Kingdom,Poltergeists / Physical Manifestations,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Poltergeists / Physical Manifestations :: Mirror Pulled Off The Wall

T his happened about 6 years ago in my previous house. I was laying in bed looking out into the upstairs hallway as my door was open and my bed faced the door. I could see all of the hallway and the full length mirror hanging opposite the stairs by a piece of string running along the top of it.

Randomly the top of the mirror came off the wall while the bottom was still in position. The mirror then fell forward, the bottom having never touched the floor. Because it fell forward, it slid all the way down the stairs smashing at the bottom. My mum then screamed at me and my sisters for throwing the mirror!

Now what I find weird is that the string should of snapped and so the mirror would of somewhat slid down the wall, the bottom of the mirror hitting the floor and then would fall forward! It was like it was pulled off the wall top first. I didn't find it freaky because it was just so strange.

After that any mirror or picture hung on that wall would fall off! My parents of course still didn't believe what I saw!

Strange Man in my House,United Kingdom,Apparitions / Voices / Touches,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Apparitions / Voices / Touches :: Strange Man in my House

T hese two incidents actually happened to my middle sister. My sister sat in the living room watching TV while everybody else had just left for work or school. It had been about an hour when my sister heard the back door open, someone wipe their feet and walk through the hallway and pass the open living room door. Now she didn't see who exactly it was, as she had carried on watching TV thinking it was my dad or granddad coming home for something. So she had seen someone pass in the corner of her eye. After a few minutes, she didn't hear anything so got up and went to the hallway to find out whoever it was and carried on down the hallway and out the front door. Both the doors were wide open. She couldn't see anyone on the street. And where I live it would be very difficult to escape without anyone hearing you. Now that could of been an attempted burglar!

Another time, a few days after, my sister had just gotten back from college and walked up to the door. Now she had a back door key but as she approached the front door (patterned glass door), she saw someone walk out the living room down the hallway and turn into the kitchen. While watching this, she had banged on the door thinking it was my dad. She shouted to let her in! After a while, nothing happened so she walked to the back door and let herself in, to find that there was NO ONE at all in the house! Now she checked all the doors and windows to see if they had been opened (burglar check) but they were all locked!

She swears both times that someone or something had been in our house!

Black Mass at the End of the Bed,United Kingdom,Apparitions / Voices / Touches,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Apparitions / Voices / Touches :: Black Mass at the End of the Bed

I cannot remember this incident as I was only 6 or 7. My parents tell it to me because it really freaked them out at the time. Now my parents are the kind of people that just don't get spooked by anything.

It was in my childhood home and I had a room to myself. Now for a week, apparently, I would wake up in the middle of the night screaming and crying. Of course my parents would rush in to see what the hell was going on. Only to find me hysterical, saying that the monster was at the end of my bed! As usual my parents thought it was just child nightmares. Or maybe our cat had walked into my room.

But one night, as I woke up again, hysterical, just my dad came but this time, he tells me he peeked through the gap in the door before walking in. And he says all he saw was a black mass at the end of my bed. Of course, as he opened the door to go in it disappeared!

After awhile I slept through the night. What ever it was had left. To this day, he can't explain it and admits he was freaked out. A lot of weird things have happened to me or my family. Quite strange.

The Story of the Dead Soldiers,Afghanistan,Apparitions / Voices / Touches,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Apparitions / Voices / Touches :: The Story of the Dead Soldiers

I t first started when I entered the army. I was sent to Afghanistan to help fight in the war. During the war, there was this battle. The date was January 23, 2005 and then there was this nasty sandstorm! Nobody could see anything! I opened my eyes hastily and found something that I never thought I would see in my life!

It was actually ghosts! And, they were wearing the U.S. Army, Air Force, and Navy clothes. The only reason I think I could've seen them was because of the sand. They were helping us with the sandstorm fight off the people of Afghanistan! While the sandstorm was going, they were saluting us. That was the first time that I had ever seen spirits!

Then the next time, I was taking a vacation with my family, (I had been sent back to America to stay.) And we were on the beach of Jamaica and the wind picked up and the sand blew for about 5 to 7 seconds. Just then, I was the only one I think that had just seen the spirits and just then they said to me...

Missing Cell Phone,"California, United States",Family / Friends Visits,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Family / Friends Visits :: Missing Cell Phone

H ave any of you ever heard noises like banging of pans, hitting the counter, or any other creepy noise like whispering in your ear? All of those happened to me. This isn't that big of a deal, but I just thought I'd share it. So, here's the real story. I heard noises like that, and I would say stuff like ""Shut Up!"" or ""God, will you shut up already?"". But finally, I was nice. I said ""Would you please be quiet?"". It stopped. It was pretty creepy, after it stopped, I had a horrible feeling. Like there was something in that very room. Like someone was watching me. It's probably my imagination, but every time I close a door, the millisecond before it is shut, I hear my Great Grandma saying my name.

Now for the cell phone. I was watching TV And I put my phone on the table and I AM SURE I PUT IT ON THE TABLE. I went in my room to take out my pet rat and I called my dad on the house phone. After about ten minutes, I heard a weird squeaky noise. No, it was not my rat. I went back into the room with my cell phone and it was gone. I searched and searched and I found it at the very bottom of the laundry basket! I know who it was. It was my dad's dad. He died a long time ago and my dad told me he was a bit of a jokester.

Ghost Party,"Korea, Republic of",Apparitions / Voices / Touches,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Apparitions / Voices / Touches :: Ghost Party

T his story I'm about to tell you really happened to me swear to god! If I'm making this up may a hobo fry my brains for an omelet! Well, it all happened when I went to korea to visit my mom on Jan. 14 sunday. I watched a tv show when it was time for me to got to bed. But I heard something interesting... ""Blank gathers in this day"".

Then my worst fears were realized. Jan. 16 is the day when ghosts get together. In Jan. 16 I forgot the whole ghost thing then. While I was playing outside at night with a couple of my korean friends and cousins, I saw something strange, I said ""hey what's that?"" in korean, then suddenly my friends and cousins were shaking badly and I yelled ""Hey who are you!?"" I said in korean, then the unexpected happened. The women or a girl, because I couldn't tell, looked at us and showed her face and I mean, oh my god, the face scared the living hell out of me!

We were screaming and running inside until we saw more ghosts and I said ""we're so getting out of here!"". And I ran inside and told my mom the whole story and she looked out and almost everyone in the whole apartment complex heard the story and saw the whole thing and slept with scary dreams.

If I'm making this up, may a zookeeper make me a plate of monkey business!

A Real Nightmare,"New York, United States",Apparitions / Voices / Touches,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Apparitions / Voices / Touches :: A Real Nightmare

T his happened to me about a few weeks ago when I was going to bed one thursday night. I had to wake up for school the next day so I tried really hard to get to sleep. Hours past and couldn't get to sleep. It was 4:00 am when I heard this loud tapping on the side of a door. I wasn't sure what door, I just knew it wasn't the one that led into my bedroom. I have two cats, so I figured it was one of them. But how in the world could a cat do that? So I quietly slid out of my bed and walked into the long hallway that stretched down to my dad's room. The tapping had stopped, and at least 10 seconds later, a small sighing came from the bathroom. I stood outside my bedroom frightened to death. But I didn't really believe in ghosts (at the time) so I walked into the bathroom prepared for my brother to jump out and scare me.

Instead, a dark shadow stood in the corner of the shower. I turned on the light and blinked a couple times, but the figure still stood facing the corner. I didn't know what to do, I panicked and ran to my room hiding my self under the covers. Light footsteps thudded out of the bathroom and I peaked from under the covers to face a tall blond women looking to be in her thirties standing in my doorway. Her white night gown was covered with blood and she held a knife in one hand. I screamed as loud as I could and once again hid under my covers. When louder footsteps came pounding down the hallway my dad came running in.

I knew my dad wouldn't believe me so I told him it was a bad dream. He gave me a stern face and patted me on the back. I haven't seen that women or the dark figure again, but I know that they're still haunting my house.

Knock on Bedroom Door,"Maryland, United States",Family / Friends Visits,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Family / Friends Visits :: Knock on Bedroom Door

T his is half my story, half my own. My mom told me multiple times that she's heard things and even seen things in our house that my dad built himself, it used to be just a corn field. This is the few stories my mom shared with me...

Many mornings as she is getting ready for work, she'll hear a knock on her bedroom door. Thinking that it's me or my little brother, she'll open the door expecting one of us, but come to find no one. She usually just ignores it and goes back to what she was doing.

One time, she goes into the hallway and looks down the stairs (she thought she heard our dog). When she looks down, though, she sees an rob of light in the hallway bellow. At the time my dad has left for work and my brother and I are sleeping. She says that she thinks it's my great grandfather who died quite recently, and that he's probably going to wait for my great grandmother who has alzheimer. That doesn't really make sense to me though because my great grand mother is staying with my grandmother (my mom's mom). I haven't directly seen anything yet that was most definitely a ghost. I tend to just feel/sense them. Though I think I may see their auras, it's hard to be 100% sure, I can usually see faint auras around living people too, I can also kind of tell what someone is feeling (like emotionally and sometimes physically).

If any one has anything to say or suggest about any of this please share it... I really want to know what's going on!

Ghost Dog,"Texas, United States",Pets / Animals,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Pets / Animals :: Ghost Dog

A few nights ago I was chatting away with my friends on myspace. I was the only one awake, and was already a little shaken up by the creaks that the house made. I silently sat back to take a breath, when I heard the panting of a dog. Freaked out, I turned around quickly to look and see if one of my dogs had wondered into the room. Then there was a heavy, moist, breath on my foot, along with the panting noise of a dog. Scared nearly half to death, I ran downstairs, and crawled into my bed. Sure, my imagination pulls tricks on me but not that good of tricks. You may say whatever, and I'm just a young kid. But I know what I heard and what I felt. Since then, my mom had told me she has heard the scratching of a dog on a door, when all of our dogs were outside.

Many other things have happened here in our old house, and I am glad that we are moving out of it. I mean, come on, my sister seeing an old lady, a man and a little girl. Plus two dogs. That's just plain crazy for us to stay living here. Therefore... We are moving and that's final!

Rush of Air in my Ear,"Minnesota, United States",Family / Friends Visits,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Family / Friends Visits :: Rush of Air in my Ear

T his is a really short story, but it's something I have never forgotten. My grandfather (on my father's side) passed away in 1999, during my first week in high school. I was very close with him and his death was definitely a blow. Sometimes it's still hard for me to believe he's really gone. And maybe that's why this happened.

About a year had gone by since my grandfather had passed away and I was sitting in the living room, reading a book. I zone out when I'm reading, so I was pretty startled when a rush of air went into my ear. I looked around and no one was in the house. They were all outside. None of the fans were on and the windows were shut, including the one I was sitting near.

And yes, at first I thought it was a draft. But then I realized that the windows were brand new and there was barely a breeze outside.

I think back to that day and deep in my heart, I believe it was my grandfather letting me know he would always be there. Even if I couldn't see him, I could at least feel his presence.

Mirror Spirit,Hong Kong,Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: Mirror Spirit

I have moved to my new house for about 1 year now, we bought it cheaper than the upper flat so I don't know if it really is because the people before also felt this place was haunted. I have always had this feeling and my friends too. Whenever I come home from school, I get this chilly feeling. It's like I'm always being watched, even as I type this, I feel watched by something. I think the source of the spirits is in my bathroom, whenever anyone takes a shower, they all feel something is watching them. I find that if I can't see a mirror, I don't feel anything. But sometimes, even the windows seem to scare me. I really can't stand it.

I don't know if I'm like just imagining things, but I just know something is wrong here. When I first came (first few days), I didn't like the feeling, I took a shower anyway, I looked behind me and I think I saw a hard coming out the shower wall. Soon after, I started seeing a man's shape in my bookshelf glass. After about 2 months, it stopped, I relaxed for about a week, then it got really bad, it was like the spirit had just moved to my bathroom door because the door has four glass panels on it (you can't see through the glass).

Also, lately, whenever I look through the door of my bathroom, I think I see something dark, a shadow moving to the mirrors, then I turn the light on and I can still feel it moving. I have only seen the spirit once, when it just was there in front of me. A shadow creature, like a man, but I could see through it, except it had no face.

Barn Ghost 4,"Wisconsin, United States",Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: Barn Ghost 4

Y ou may of read Barn Ghost 1 or 2 or even 3 . You may have gotten a comment on your story from me. Thank you for trying to help with my other problems but this is when the ghost tries to talk with me and my family.

Last Friday night both of my boys were at a friend's house. My husband and I thought we should surprise the boys with getting them a puppy. Also, we need one so we can train it to lead the sheep into the barn. Well, we drove out to a neighbor where their dog Colie just had puppies. We got two and named them Lolly for the girl and for the boy, Gollip. Funny names, huh?

David and I put the puppies in the house and they slept on the couch. The boys weren't home so we thought, FRIDAY THE 13, why not go see the ghosts. And that's what we did. We heard the cats meowing and the horses neighing. Cow mooing, and the sheep bawling. We ran in the barn. We heard the ghost. Instead of saying help me. She said ""Follow me. Follow me..."" We saw her and she ran into the cat room. Me and David just had to follow. One of the cats was dead! And it was Andy's cat and he loves his cat! And on the ghost was blood. SHE KILLED OUR CAT! But at least it wasn't Casper. But still. Also next to the girl ghost was a ghost that looked just like DAVID! IT WAS HIS DOUBLE!

That night, David and I went on the internet and it said if you see your double you will die. MY HUSBAND IS GOING TO DIE!

I didn't write this story Barn Ghost 4 to scare you, but this is a ghost story and I think you should all read it. Today Saturday April 14, 2007, my husband David did not wake up. We called the ambulance. He went to the hospital at 7:00 this morning. At 9:00, we were told he had died.

Is this why the ghost girl stayed with us? To warn us that David would see his double? If so I would like to thank the ghost girl. And I do NOT want her to be put to rest.

Grandpa,"North Carolina, United States",Family / Friends Visits,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Family / Friends Visits :: Grandpa

I was sitting in my grandma's bed. My grandpa had died 4 months before this. I switched my TV to another channel, and watched TV for a couple of minutes. After that, I looked at my bathroom door, and a grayish figure floated out of the bathroom, and into his room. I wasn't sure it was him. Later that year, my grandma was in her room, about to lay down, when she heard the doorbell ring. It was about 2:00 am and that was usually the time he came home from the bar. She just then realized she had closed the garage door before she left the living room and there was no doorbell on my front door. After 3 years of that happening, I was living with my grandma, my mom, my sister, and my dog, ozzie. For my grandma's birthday we got her a dog named Lexie. She was born on mother's day. She is very alike to my grandpa. It's very weird. She is the sweetest dog other than my other two, and my grandpa was the same way. I loved him a lot.

A Memoir of my True Love,"Nevada, United States",Family / Friends Visits,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Family / Friends Visits :: A Memoir of my True Love

S ince age three, I have been hearing voices in my mind; have dreams of personal, future events and had a Near Death Experience. Through these experiences, I have had my life saved numerous times, and had been guided through hints, to meet and marry my true love; soul mate, Rob. As wonderful as all this may seem so far, Rob and I did not meet each other until we both had two marriages behind us, and were in our forties!

Here's how we met: In 1994, I placed an ad in the Personals section of a newspaper, in Las Vegas, Nevada. Although many men (including Rob) responded, Rob was the only man I wanted to be with. During one of Rob's and my first few dates together, I realized that all the paranormal-type messages I had received during my life brought me to that very moment in time; that Rob was the man I had been in search of, for all those years. The knowing was so overwhelming for me, that I could never explain any of it to Rob.

After two months of our dating, I moved in with him at his house. A year later, we married. While we were still newlyweds, Rob passed. However, I've really never been apart from Rob. Since Rob's passing, he's come to me in several different paranormal forms: As being a mist by my side; talking to me in his same, familiar voice; as being a big, bright star in the sky; appearing to me with wearing new clothes, and in so many other ways. He somehow manages to have our wedding song be playing on the radio station I'd be listening to at the exact same time of when I'd also be feeling the most distressed.

On Easter Sunday, 1998-seven months since Rob had passed, while I was at his house (that I abandoned, due to its location in the desert), and inserting the key into the lock on the front door (to check on things, inside), a strong, sweet floral scent caught my full attention to notice some Lily of the Valley flowers that had bloomed in one of the flower beds that Rob had built. Although I had planted several different types of flower seeds in both Rob's flower beds during the summer of 1997, it was only those flowers that grew, on that day, and without having been watered since Rob's passing-over seven months!

The alarm on the wrist watch Rob wore for work still sounds off at the same time, every day, over nine years since his passing, with the same, original battery Rob had put in his watch! Rob had given me a special, precious gift - an imprint of his soul on my bedroom window's screen as proof of his visiting me one very early morning, when he then touched my body the way I had touched his, immediately after he passed.

Like the words to the wedding song, Rob and I left to fate to choose for us implies, the love Rob and I feel for each other, will surely last forever. Thank you for allowing me to share this part of my story with you.

A Real Nightmare 2,"New York, United States",Apparitions / Voices / Touches,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Apparitions / Voices / Touches :: A Real Nightmare 2

P lease read the first part of this story A Real Nightmare before you read this one. It's a while after my first incident, and before I got a visit from the gray figure in the shower and the woman in the nightgown, we had been planning to move my room to the front of the house (my old room is in the back of the house). In my old room, a lot of trees were right outside my window and occasionally their branches would rub against the window to make an annoying scratching noise.

Well, it's my first night in the new room and so far so good. I'm half asleep at about 3:45 am, or 3:50 am when that terrible scratching noise begins. I didn't think anything of it but after a couple minutes I realized that there are no trees in the front of the house. So what could be scratching on the window? I realized I was re-living the night of the dark figure in the shower and blood stained nightgown woman. My heart dropped into my stomach. I convinced myself that I was hearing things and maybe it was something else. When I heard the scratching again I noticed it was coming from the door that led out to the balcony. When I slid out of bed and walked over to the door and removed the curtains away from the window my heart skipped a beat when I saw the blonde woman with the nightgown right outside the door on the balcony. When I spun around to get back to my bed, a figure of a man in a black suit stood in front of my bed smiling. He didn't say anything, and neither did I. When he walked away I jumped into my bed.

I think this may be he last of my stories since I am much too afraid now to go investigate a strange noise and go looking for ghosts, but will these ghosts come looking for me?

The Almost Imaginary Mountain Slide,Grenada,Misc,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Misc :: The Almost Imaginary Mountain Slide

M any years ago, there were two girls that lived in the village of Fountain, on the beautiful island of Grenada. They were teenagers that did not believe in ghosts, but that was soon to be changed! They had a job to pick up what is known as Grenada's national spice, nutmeg on the side of a mountain. They heard many stories from the older folks about that part of the mountain being haunted, but they did not believe.

Just about every day, they went to work, but before they worked, they had some fun. They would call the ghosts. But that day, it was not the same. These two children heard things up in the mountain as they never heard before, as if a hurricane was up there and it was coming down, as if coming down to kill them, they ran for their lives until they reached the bottom. They reached down safely but they had to go back up to get the baskets or else they would be punished. They walked up holding hands, got the baskets and ran down and they worked on another side of the mountain. After that, they never went there again.

They are both alive today and one of them is my grandmother, and she lives to tell her true life story!

Is my Room Haunted?,United Kingdom,Misc,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Misc :: Is my Room Haunted?

I 'm feeling watched whilst I'm asleep, and I have seen ghosts in my room before (in different flats) on christmas eve. When I was trying to sleep, I felt there was something in the corner of my room. I couldn't sleep, until I fell asleep from being so tired. I hardly slept at all that night.

For a while it laded off, but then it started again. One night I turned over, then I felt something touch my cheek, I opened my eyes to see nothing was there. I'd been getting a bit fed up of staying awake every sunday night. So I invited my friend over, we stayed up until we gave up, at about eleven o'clock, then, as I went to close my eyes, I heard something walk about in my room, it sounded like floor boards creek but I had no floor boards in my room.

In the morning, I told my friend about what happened, she said she saw something outside the window. I have told my mum about what's been going on in my room, but she doesn't believe me, she thinks I'm imagining it, but all I want to know is if my room is haunted.

I Need Help,"Texas, United States",Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: I Need Help

T his is more of a plea for help than a story, so please, if there is anyone who may be able to help me with this I would be forever grateful. I moved into a old house, some 5 years ago, out of desperation, so that I did not have to tote my son the 15 miles one way to High School 5 days a week. I swore to myself that this was only temporary, but even after his graduation from High School 2 years ago, I am still stuck here, because of financial reasons.

Since childhood, I have always been sensitive to spirits, and it has become even more pronounced the older I get. The house that I am in, I have always sensed a presence, and I know that one is here. I hear the footsteps at night, walking through my kitchen, and living room, and then they're just gone. It sounds like heavy boots, and a long stride, very creepy, not scary, just creepy. I hear noises like something fell, but when I check, nothing is there. I always feel watched, like it's quietly watching every move that I make. The other day, I was standing at my sink washing dishes, and I felt something touch my side, like a poke, as if it just wanted me to be aware of it's presence, almost child-like, wanting attention. I see the dark shadows, moving quickly by me, and when I look directly at it, they are gone. All of this is fine, because I do not feel threatened by it, and the situation is livable, but creepy.

My Niece lived with be for a short time, and it scared her. She said that the door knob in her bedroom would move, as if someone was trying to get into her room. She said that it would wiggle, not turn, just wiggle, and I would have to deal with her being scared out of her mind at night. My son also dealt with some scary things here before he moved out and joined the Army. But to this day, he refuses to tell me about them, because he's afraid that he will scare me, which he is probably right.

Now, this is what I am dealing with inside my house, but what is outside, I am horrified of. I don't want to sound insane, and no, I am not writing this from the inside of a Mental Institution. The presence that's outside my house has just showed up, and has been here for only about 3 weeks now. The only way I can describe what it feels like, is pure Evil. I am scared to death of it, and horror consumes me when I have to go out there. I leave very early in the morning to work, at 3:30am, so it is very dark. There are mornings that I feel it is not out there, then there are mornings that I feel it, like it is watching me from my fence line (I live in a rural area).

It has made itself known to me. It started off at first like a distinct whistle. The second thing it did almost caused me to have a heart attack, and I'm not exaggerating. That morning, I had gotten up for work. I have a Hound Dog that I keep inside my house with me, so the first thing that I do when I get up in the mornings is put my Dog outside to go to the bathroom. That morning, my Dog would not leave my porch. He would bark, and growl out into the darkness. I opened the door, and the hair on his neck was standing straight up, and he ran back into my house like he was scared, and did not stop until he was under my bed. I thought maybe a Coon or Possum was out there, and he was scared of it.

After about 20 minutes, my Dog went back to the door, wanting outside, so I opened the door, and he would not go out, and I had to push him outside. Again, he would not leave the porch, and stood there bristled up, growling into the darkness. I opened the door, and he ran into the house again. I was not scared, just confused by the way my Dog was acting. Now it came time for me to leave for work.

I turned off all the lights, and walked down my sidewalk, through my front gate, and got into my car. I put my keys into the ignition, and was fumbling for the headlight switch, which for some reason I could not find. My car window was down about half-way, but my door was shut. From the dark area that my Dog had been so frightned of, about 50 feet in front of my car, I heard a sound that I have never heard before. It sounded like it was right in my ear doing this , and it sounded like someone was blowing on a duck call, but very baritone and strange sounding. It was so loud it made my ears hurt. It scared me so bad, I felt like my heart was up in my neck, and I suddenly got this awful headache. I started my car, and my entire body was shaking to the point I could hardly press the gas accelerator. I backed up, and finally found the headlights on my car, and turned them on, pointing them into the direction of the noise. I saw nothing.

A week later, I got this phone call that was strange. It was my best friend calling me, as that's what my caller ID showed. I answered the phone, said ""hello"", and this very faint voice of a man came on and said ""hello"". It sounded like he was a million miles away, with a static like sound. I detected a slight accent, like he may have been Hispanic. I asked him who he was, and after a long pause, he said ""who is this"". I got very freaked out, and almost hung the phone up, but told myself not to. I asked him if he had the wrong number, and he said ""no"", then the line went dead. I immediately called my fried back, and asked her if she had just tried to call me, and she said ""yes"", but the phone was doing something weird. She said that it was making this sound, like static blaring from a TV, and sound was fading in and out. She wanted to know what was going on with my phone.

Now, I don't know if this had anything to do with all of these other things, but it was weird. I don't know what is going on at my house, and why all of this is happening. I am really scared, to the point all I can do is sit on my couch after dark, and brace myself for something to happen. I feel almost like what's outside, wants in, and it's feeding off my fear, like it's enjoying it. I have not done anything to draw whatever this is to me. I even went to the extreme of getting Olive Oil, and praying, while sprinkling it around my house, inside and out. Whatever it is, I want it to leave me alone, but it won't.

PLEASE, anyone who can help with this, or can tell me why this is happening, please do. I have a fear, because my Son is due to go to Iraq in September, something is trying to warn me of a pending doom with him. If anyone can read into this situation, and knows about this stuff, please tell me. I am horrified.

I can remember, in 1997, I was just about ready to go to sleep for the night, and I wanted to just relax on the couch for a short time. I only closed my eyes for a second and I wasn't asleep. I heard, this loud noise against the house, right beside me. There was also a window beside me and I heard it vibrating and shaking! I opened my eyes very fast and I was nervous and a bit scared! I got up slowly and looked out the window... It was silent outside. It was summer time and there was no wind. I looked towards the outside light that was on and still it seemed like nothing had happened. I kept on looking for the object that hit the house and I couldn't see it. I went to my own bedroom and went to sleep.

I know, I wasn't dreaming any of this! I told my mother the next day, and she believed me. She thought I caused that to happen. Maybe I did! I must have a strong imagination for that matter. I never felt so scared in a long time and the anxiety bothered me a lot that night.

I wonder, does this ever happen to other people? I still think it's strange because I was so relaxed and comfortable before any of this! Thanks, for reading.

The Lightwood House Ghosts,"Virginia, United States",Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: The Lightwood House Ghosts

D uring Easter break, my family and I traveled to Surry, Virginia so we could stay in the lightwood house (The lightwood house was built in 1739). One night, at about 11:30pm, my brother-in-law and I were sitting in the living room, watching television. As we were sitting there, all of a sudden we got a quick chill and then we heard a whisper and it was right next to us. The whisper only lasted for about 3 seconds, so we thought each other said something, but we didn't. We didn't think anything of it. Then about 5 minutes later, we heard it again. This time, we thought it was my sister, brother, or my parents but they were sleeping. After that, we tried to get it out of our heads. But then about 10 minutes later, we heard talking in the next room over. We got up to look thinking it was my brother messing with us but... Nothing. We thought it was the wind. But then, about 3 minutes later, we heard the talking again and this time, we got sick of it and we yelled at it to shut-up, but I think we made it mad because on either the floor, ceiling, or walls, we heard pounding for about 5 seconds. This time we were really freaked and ready to go to bed, but right before we turned off the T.V. it started to flicker on and off, along with the one light inside the other room.

We both yelled and asked it to please stop and let our family be. It stopped and didn't happen again for the rest of our stay.
