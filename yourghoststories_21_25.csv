Nursing Home Encounters,"Michigan, United States",Poltergeists / Physical Manifestations,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Poltergeists / Physical Manifestations :: Nursing Home Encounters

I started working in an assisted living facility in June of 2004. I worked the 2nd shift, 2-10pm. There were two units in the 40 bed facility. Unit one was for patients who needed assistance with their everyday needs. Unit two was the unit that I worked all the time, the Alzheimer's/Dementia unit.

Most nights, I would be assigned to the until alone. At the time, there were only ten rooms filled out of the twenty rooms total. A year had passed and more patients moved into the facility. Staffing grew, and on most days, there were two staff members assigned to both units. During a three month period, we were short staffed, and I was working the unit alone. This never bothered me.

The building at the time was only a few years old, but many deaths had occurred since the opening of the facility. Working alone, you would always catch a glimpse of something moving out of the corner of your eye. Lights would be on in rooms that were unoccupied. The call light system, which sounded an alarm in the nurses station when a patient needed help, would go off in rooms that were unoccupied. These were normal occurrences, that didn't bother me.

On one particular night, I was assigned to the unit alone. This was nothing new to me, and I just accepted it, and went about my duties. In one room in general, the lights came on several times over the night. I would always go in, and shut them off. After multiple times of this, I just ignored them.

After a couple of hours past without me shutting the lights off, the call lights went off in the room. I went in, and shut them all off. After that, they all went off again, this time, I was getting a little bit scared. I walked over to the other unit, and told them about what was happening. Two other staff members and myself walked down to the room, and shut everything off. My co-worker announced to whomever was doing this, to stop immediately. My co-workers went about their duties on the other unit.

An hour before my shift was up, I was standing in the nurses station drawing up insulin for a 9pm dose for a patient. The call light went off, and assuming it was someone who needed help, I finished drawing up the insulin, and turned around to see which room had pulled the cord. To my surprise, it was room number 126, the same room that had been pulling it all night long. I called over to the other unit, and the same two staff members came over, and together, we walked down to the room to turn the lights off for what we hoped to be the last time that night.

When we entered the room, it felt at least 20 degrees colder. We walked into the living area, shut the call light off, followed by the bedroom, and the bathroom. When we turned around, we noticed that all of the cupboard doors in the kitchen were being swung open. This caused my co-workers to scream, and we all ran from the room. The administrator of the building was called, and she in return, called the owner of the building, and he said that it was all a part of our imagination.

A couple nights had passed, and still, lights went on and off spontaneously in the room. One night in particular, a patient was walking up and down the hallway, acting very agitated. I noticed her walking to the end of the hallway, and peering into the window of the room that had all of the oddities happening. When asked why she was staring into the room, she turned to me, and in a cold voice, stated she wanted to join in on the party. This woman had Alzheimer's Disease, so she could not have known what was happening whatsoever.

That same night, during shift change, we had a total of six staff members doing rounds, checking on every patient to make sure they were okay. While in the hallway of 126, we started feeling a strange vibration coming from the floor. The building was fairly new, and the flooring underneath the carpeting, was cement. We found it odd to feel such a vibration. As we continued to get closer to room 126, we noticed the vibration was turning more into a shaking type of feeling. The pictures on the walls were rattling, and the signs next to the door containing patient's names, were also rattling. It felt as if there was a minor earthquake, which is impossible in Michigan. As soon as the door to 129 was opened, which is the room number of the woman who stated she wanted to join in on the party, the rambling stopped.

This event was enough to make the six of us want to quit. Our administrator took it upon herself to call a local church who came in and blessed the room. A bible was placed in the room, and even though this all took place, strange occurrences have also been happening. Televisions will turn on, radios will turn on, and the bible will now even close on its own.

There is no explanation to why these things are happening, but we do know that the spirits in the building are very much alive.

My Baby Brother,"Arkansas, United States",Family / Friends Visits,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Family / Friends Visits :: My Baby Brother

T o give a little background of what I'm fixing to say, my little brother ""john"" contracted meningitis when he was 16 months old. The doctors had said he had the cold and sent him home regardless of what my mother was trying to tell them. Within 24 hours he was in the hospital and pronounced brain-dead.

To make a long story short... I was really regretful that I didn't get to know him like my other siblings due to the fact that I haven't spoken to my family in 2 years, which at the time before he passed, I only seen john a few times, and baby sit him. So I was deeply grieved, and felt guilty that I wasn't their for him. I shouldn't have let my bad communication with my mother affect my relationships with my siblings. All 9 of them.

Since the time he got taken off life support, I was very depressed, and asked God how he's doing, and I said I just want to talk to him, and let him know how I feel, and etc.

Well one day, about a week after his funeral, I got home from dropping my daughter off at school, and my son made a big mess of the refrigerator (3 y/o) and I was very irritated with him, so I sent him to his room. I went to my room afterwards and laid down, I don't remember going to sleep, I was laying their, then all of a sudden I felt a heavy pressure on my chest, then it was like I was watching a film clip of my brother playing with his cars and he was looking at me and grinning, he was in his diaper, just doing baby stuff but it seemed as though he was looking at me.

I started crying telling him that I was sorry I wasn't there, and that I loved him, and asked him to forgive me, then I felt as though he told me he loved me and not to cry anymore. Then it was over like that.

I felt God really has answered my pleas, and let me make my peace with him. My brother. Ever since then my guilt has been gone, but I told my mother about this, and she asked what he was wearing, and I told her the cars he had, she said those were his favorite cars. The clothes he had on, were the clothes he used to wear.

Possessed Cat,"Nevada, United States",Pets / Animals,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Pets / Animals :: Possessed Cat

I 'm about to tell you all something that happened which I believe to be my very first ghost experience. It happened about 2 weeks after I started 3rd grade and will always be a part of my memory...

The day had started out abnormal in itself. I had been feeling strangely suffocated, as if I was in a huge crowd, even though my house was never stuffy, and neither was the school since it was newly built. Not only did I feel suffocated, but my mind had felt empty in itself... As if some veil had been uncovered from within, but nothing special seemed to happen the night before.

It was only until after school that I had noticed strange things. A dog I could only see through my right eye, glimpses of people never seen before from the corner of my eye. Everything seemed like there was a new world now. The only thing that I felt mainly odd about was that I could only catch these glimpses through my right eye. Even when I turned around from feeling a presence I wouldn't notice exactly what it was until I saw it from the right side.

About an hour before dinner, me and my little brother, Spencer, were having a drawing contest in the dining room while our parents watched TV in the living room. We had a dog named Toya and a cat named Shadow. While me and Spencer were drawing monsters, we both heard scurrying paws and clacking nails on the floor in the direction of the kitchen, but when we looked over, there was nothing there.

We searched around for Shadow to see if it was her, even shouted for our parents to help, but the second we shouted, one of the dining room tables moved a few feet. Now, our dog was outside playing with the quail in the backyard, and our parents had just yelled back saying Shadow was on our dad's lap, so me and spencer panicked and ran over to our parents, saying something was in the kitchen.

Our mom came with us back and searched for whatever it was, but didn't find anything. Except me... Who had been catching glimpses of something dark in the corner of my eye every so often in the corner of areas. Normally I'd think they were just shadows, but they seemed denser, and more mobile than a shadow would be in mid-afternoon. After a bit of searching, we gave up and headed to the living room to watch TV while dad cooked.

Later that night after dinner, Shadow had been sleeping in my lap as I watched some cartoons. Every once in a while, there were sounds of purring and mewing that I heard coming from nearby, but not from my cat. Soon after the purrs and mews, they slowly turned to hisses and yowls coming from behind me. The only thing that kept me from jumping off the chair and running to dad was the fact that everyone in the house was with me, but they never heard a thing. My brother had been asleep on the couch as well.

Finally, heading to bed, me and spencer started talking about what the chair could've been. Joking that it was one of our drawings coming to life and jumping back into the paper. But when I told him about the hissing and yowling, spencer seemed almost too scared to turn off the lights in the room to sleep. At last, we were forced into bed and our dad shut the light off.

I was unable to sleep though... Not because of the previous encounter, but because I was thinking about how cramped it seemed. As if I was supposed to make room for someone, I scooted towards the wall side of my bed.

After hours, I had finally gotten to the point where I was dozing off. But one thing stopped me from falling asleep... It was purring. Even though I knew it was Shadow under spencer's bed, I felt uneasy about the purring. It was louder than usual. Suddenly, my heart jumped at the sound of gargling and snarling. A sound that seemed as if my cat had been choked and force-fed something at the same time. I jolted up to see what was wrong with Shadow, but immediately regretted it as I stared at my black cat's glaring, green eyes and her bared fangs as she hissed and snarled at me. She was still at the foot of my brother's bed though, which was the opposite side of the room. But all I could do was stare...

Suddenly, the cat leapt at my bed and bore her claws, and my reaction was to grab my pillow and cover myself with it. All I knew to do was scream and yell as my cat slashed and tore at the pillow, trying to get through it to me. Even though I was being attacked, I was unable to strike back and defend myself... For it was my dearest friend in the world.

After a few minutes of yelling, I heard footsteps coming to the door. My dad burst in and turned on the lights. The second the lights turned on, everything stopped. My cat suddenly collapsed and I noticed spencer sitting up in horror staring at the now limp cat. I had never been so scared, and apparently, our cat had never done anything even remotely close to showing any signs of anger in the past. At least that's what I'm told.

I still have a scar from where her claws dug into my arm from a lucky strike. The reason I say this is a ghost experience, is because I believe my cat was possessed. The moment the lights turned on, I had caught a peculiar sight of what seemed like dark mist seeping out of Shadow's fur. It seemed more than the imagination though. The mist seemed to hover over her body before fading into the light which had been on for at least 45 seconds throughout the scene.

Anima 2,Greece,Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: Anima 2

I t was early one Sunday afternoon and since it was our day off, which meant that Anima was also closed, I decided to take advantage of the huge back garden and the sunshine and took my four dogs (3 boxers and a tiny greek breed) and headed down to the bar which is just two blocks away. My four-legged companions and me were in a pretty good mood that day since they knew they would have a huge garden to explore and I would be enjoying my afternoon coffee watching them play.

I decided to enter through the garden-gate since we had cleaned the bar after last night's party and I didn't want the dogs scratching the well-polished wooden floors. When inside the garden, I was prepared for my dogs' usual playful charges (they chase one another around the garden, jump over bushes, even climb a few of the smaller trees) but, instead, they gathered in front of the back door leading to the inner bar. They seemed quite nervous sniffing the air and Fatima (my very protective female boxer) attempted to prevent me from opening the back door. I got a little tensed thinking that they smelled something I couldn't see but soon discarded it as being nothing but the noise from the busy road at the front of the bar. And yet, I let the dogs in with me, just to be on the safe side, completely indifferent towards the wooden floors and the agitated cleaning lady.

I was inside the bar now and, despite the dogs' reactions (they ran around sniffing every corner as well as the air) I could see nothing out of place. The bar was empty, clean and tidy, if one ignored the smell of cigarettes from the previous night. I opened all the windows to let some fresh air in and headed inside the stone-built bar to make me a cup of coffee. As I went inside the kitchen to get a mug, I noticed a number of glasses and other china piled up neatly on the table and I hurried to put them back on their shelves before my husband saw them since I assumed the cleaning lady had forgotten to do so.

I was now sitting in the garden under one of the Arabic tents (a favourite spot for the customers) and was wondering why my dogs, instead of having the time of their lives, were laying at my feet. A few minutes afterwards, my father called to inform me he was coming to join us so I ran back inside to make him a cup of coffee too. I closed the door behind me this time letting the dogs out and as I walked on to the inner bar, I thought I heard one of the toilets flushing as if someone was using it. At that, I felt cold sweat running down my face and my hands started trembling. I was certain I was alone in the bar and I wasn't willing to check that one out! Just to make things worse, the dogs were now right outside the door barking their hearts out and, loosing my courage, I fled out into the garden.

When dad arrived, he instantly asked me what was wrong. ""You're as white as a sheet. Are you alright?""

Of course I wasn't willing to tell my ""logical"" father about the noise. I just told him I was tired and went back inside to make him coffee but making sure to keep speaking to him at the same time and, as you might have guessed, I lured him in.

The rest of the afternoon passed more joyfully with my dad playing around with my dogs and my husband, who had come to join us but my mind was still clinging to the previous events.

The next morning I received a call from the cook who had gone to Anima to fill the fridge with some shopping. She was really upset with the cleaning lady who hadn't even bothered to put the dishes and glasses onto the shelves Saturday night. She told me that it wasn't her responsibility to do that but that she would gladly do it only this once just because of me.

George's Home,United Kingdom,Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: George's Home

I t's been more than 10 years since I stayed at the cottage in England. Me and my family went on holiday down in England to visit a theme park called Alton Towers, we rented a cottage out for the weekend, I think it was in a place called Leith. There were over 10 of us staying here including my dog.

When we first got to the cottage, we got a tour of it, then the owner left. There was a guest book for people to write comments about what they thought of their stay at the cottage, we had a look and a lot of the guests said they experienced strange things happening and that there was a ghost called George. We did not think anything of it, we thought it was just a joke for the guests.

The first night my parents and my uncle were out at the cinema leaving me, my auntie and my brother. My brother and I were asleep when they came back. When they came in the house they could see my Auntie was very scared, she told them she heard people running down the halls, at first she thought it was my brother and I but she checked and we were fast asleep.

As she was telling them what happened they heard a big bang upstairs and thought one of us had just falling out of bed, my dad checked on us but we were still fast asleep, all of a sudden all the doors upstairs started banging, my dad ran down stairs but had to go back for us.

The next day we thought nothing of it, and headed to the theme park.

When we got back were all out in the garden, and my dad was in one of the rooms in the house and saw one of the doors opening and said ""Who's there"" no one answered so my dad started shouting ""Come on then George show yourself"" After the door just started banging!

Some other things happened to such as carpets being flipped over when we woke up and TV's going on, on their own.

Grandparents' Haunted House,"Indiana, United States",Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: Grandparents' Haunted House

M y grandpa's house is haunted. Someone who killed himself used to live there. One time we were there for my grandpa's 50th birthday and everyone was downstairs and we heard a doors slam upstairs. We all went up there and all three doors were lying on the floor. This happens repeatedly. The dog will stand at the bottom of the stairs during the day and will just stare at the top. During the night the dog will go nowhere near the stairs and will bite if you try taking it upstairs.

On Christmas day one year we were eating Christmas dinner and my Uncle looked into the living room where the Christmas tree was and it started shaking back and fourth. He had my step grandma look at it to and she saw it too, so he knew he wasn't just seeing things.

One time grandpa and step grandma were out of town for a week so my aunt came over to watch the house and to take care of the dog. She went near the stairs and felt an evil thing near. She went to get a glass of water and felt something behind her. When she turned around she saw a ghost. She ran, grabbed the dog, and left. She refuses to go to the house.

Our family does not like the house whatsoever. Grandpa and step grandma do not mind living there. They said after all the years living in the house they have gotten used to it.

The Little Shadow Boy,Poland,Apparitions / Voices / Touches,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Apparitions / Voices / Touches :: The Little Shadow Boy

I live in Poland and have been living here for about 2 years now. In october my best friend made a birthday party and invited me to it. I decided to ride a bus to her house. The buses here in Poland are all different and I personally like the new ones.

So I took a bus and stood in the very front where there's big windows where you can see out. I stood there as the buses stopped here and there. Then the bus stopped on one stop and in front of the bus was this side walk where there's white lines on the ground. I was bored and staring out of the windows when I saw a weird sight. I saw a small boy dressed in a t-shirt and shorts. He seemed kind of of black, a bit like a shadow. Also he was on the white lines apparently jumping on them. (Thank goodness there was no cars passing through) I was watching the boy and got interrupted when an old lady got in. Once the old lady was seated I paid attention back to where the boy was but he was gone. I still remember what a strange sight it was. Plus it was a cold day and everyone was wearing jackets you know? He still haunts my mind.

If anyone has advice on what I might've saw can they comment please? It could've been my imagination but I don't think so... It felt real but weird.

A Few Family Ghost Stories,"Michigan, United States",Misc,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Misc :: A Few Family Ghost Stories

W hen my mom and aunt were children in the 1950s, my aunt was taking piano lessons and learning to play a particular song. At that time, both parents were working so my mom and aunt were alone for a few hours after school. One day, when my mom and aunt got home from school, they had just opened the door to the house when my aunt freaked out and started crying.

She claimed to hear the song she was learning being played on the piano in the, as of yet, empty house. My mom didn't hear it, but told my aunt that maybe she was hearing it because she was anticipating playing it.

My grandfather died of a heart attack in 1984 when I was six years old. My mom told me that a few days after he died, my grandmother received a phone call that was just static on the other end. We think it was my grandfather.

A few years ago in 2003, my mom was at home alone (in our present house) when she said a glass in one of the cupboards spontaneously exploded, sending glass shards flying all over the place. It was true because we were finding shards all over the place even a few weeks later.

My mom also has a violin that she plays and a couple of times, I've heard it play a note while it's shut up in its case. My dad says he has also heard it.

One time, I was home alone when I heard clunking and scratching sounds coming from our basement. No, I did NOT go down to investigate!

The Lady Upstairs,"Connecticut, United States",Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: The Lady Upstairs

W hen I was younger every weekend I would sleep over my grandmothers house. I would sleep in the living room on the floor across from the wall where the stairs were. Now you couldn't see the stairs they were blocked by the wall. I'm not the only one to have experienced what I'm about to write. My cousins have all had the same thing happen to them when they slept over.

I would be asleep and awaken to my grandfather's grandfather clock going off, it went off every hour but the only time it would wake me up was at midnight. I'd roll over as it was going off and I could see a white light come from the stairs. I would pull my blanket up so that only my eyes were peeking out and watch and every time it happened the same way. The light would get closer as it came down the stairs until it turned the corner and, as it turned the corner, it would fade away. That's all it ever did, it was scary when it was happening but nothing bad ever happened.

Now the story is called the lady upstairs but to be honest I don't know if it was a lady. I guess it just kind of felt like a woman, the white light resembling a dress to me. And one night I had a dream that I still remember vividly. I woke up to the light in my dream but this time I went up the stairs and as I was walking up, the ""lady"" leaned over the banister and started screaming at me. I woke up after that and assumed the light was this lady. I would also wake up sometimes and it would feel like my hand was being held, I couldn't see anything it just felt like pressure on my hand the way it would feel if someone was holding it.

So that's my story, it's not very scary but it happened. And I have a question, I would like to ask the more experienced readers. My cousin died in nov. and my uncle says he can still feel her presence. I haven't felt it, I want to and I pray that she will come to me just so I can see her one last time, I know its selfish of me if she's already moved on but the last time I saw her was a year before her death and I was wondering if there's anyway to get her to come to me.

I know a lot of the experiences on here are random and they're just there. But is there anyway to actually bring her here? I have already tried the Ouija board and it didn't work at all for me. Please help?

A Ouija a Day Doesn't Keep the Demons Away,"Missouri, United States",Ouija Board / Seances,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Ouija Board / Seances :: A Ouija a Day Doesn't Keep the Demons Away

T his story happened to my grandmother. Picture it, mid 1960s. Every novelty store had a strange game called Ouija Board. It was considered good fun to use one. In fact, it became the party tradition for a group of friends. Almost everyday, a party would be held at one person's house to play ouija board. They didn't think of the consequences of using the board. Why would they? It was only a game.

Then one late Friday night, a newcomer came to the party. Twenty people gathered around the table to show this woman what fun they would have with the ouija board. My grandmother was the leader though. She knew the ouija board better than anyone there. She volunteered to play with this newcomer.  All throughout the night, they played the ouija board. They thought it was an innocent game until weird things started happening.

The doors and windows were opening by themselves. Things were thrown against the wall. They all thought it was a joke. They thought one of the party goers had set up this elaborate joke. But it wasn't a joke. They asked who was in charge of the ouija board. The board spelled out S-A-T-A-N. Everyone's expression was blank. They realized it wasn't a joke. Nothing happened after that.

The Hands,"New York, United States",Apparitions / Voices / Touches,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Apparitions / Voices / Touches :: The Hands

T his story is taking place in the apartment, in my room in which I still live in today. This was the second house I moved in since I was four. I was sitting on my queen sized bed that me and my mom sleep in. I just finished drawing a broken heart and I was about to put it away... When I suddenly felt cold air around the room. It was strange because it was a very hot and humid day and the windows in back of me were tightly shut. I took my sweater and put it on. Suddenly the chill was gone and it became hot again.

I was curious very curious and I kept wondering how the room temperature could change drastically and quickly. I thought my mom turned on the air conditioner but she was no where in sight. Then, I suddenly remembered that she was down stairs trying to carry boxes with my aunt. Now that the room is back to its normal hot temperature I went in the kitchen to get a drink. Then, as soon as I turned around to leave the kitchen I felt the temperature changing and it became chilly again.

I was walking back to my room, then suddenly I see something strange happen. I saw hands pointing to my aunt's room and the bathroom. Those hands I saw was no joke, the strange hands pointing to the room were pure white as if there is no more blood in them, they also looked very cold. I close my eyes trying to forget about what I just saw, it was very paranormal and it scared me. I could never forget about that day, I swore never to tell my mom for she would never believe me.

To this day I still look back and wonder why the hands were there and why they were pointing to my aunt's room and the bathroom. Maybe it's a sign of something that will happen in the future or a sign that is telling that something happened in this house before I moved in...

Old House Haunting,"Virginia, United States",Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: Old House Haunting

B ack again, but this story is different from my auditorium story . When I was around 4 years old I was living in a house which isn't that far from where I live now and isn't far from my high school. It all started by me seeing shadow figures or people in reflections and of course me being 4, it scared me.

Well one night I was awoken in a start and just happened to look at my window. What I saw shocked me, it was a shadow figure but not the normal ones. It was moving as if it was trying to get into the window. I screamed and my father came in and turned on the light and went to the window and saw nothing. I told him to turn the light off and look again, there was nothing. He passed it off as a bad dream but it was too real. Now you're saying it could have been a prank or a tree, well my room was on the third story, and the tree that was by it was (and still is) a pretty big tree but in no way looks that much like a person.

I was tormented with bad dreams until the point where I couldn't sleep in that room and slept in my parents room until I was about 8.

Now when my friends slept over we wouldn't sleep in my room because they would refuse, in fact they would refuse to go anywhere near it and I would have my toys brought downstairs. Well one night my friend and I were playing with my wrestling figures, we put them down and went to sleep. The next morning they were scattered all over the room, some on top of each other and others just laying there.

I would hate being there alone after dark and wouldn't leave the living room or the computer room.

Pet Coming to Say Goodbye,Australia,Pets / Animals,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Pets / Animals :: Pet Coming to Say Goodbye

N ow, I've read a lot about ghost stories. I used to have an obsession a few years back with them. And from what I've read, a few factors of it point to a ghost. I'm not a hundred per cent sure whether it was a ghost although I can't think of anything else it could have been. I guess I'll leave it up to you to decide

When I was 11, I adored this little kitten. It belonged to the next door neighbours and they mistreated it. I felt heart broken, and looked after it as much as I could. I would pet it, feed it, and showed it love. Over time, it learned to trust me and it loved no human more than me. Even when it had kittens, it bought them over from next door and left them outside my window still.

When it grew into cat hood the next door neighbours decided they didn't want the hassle of it getting pregnant again. So they got it speyed. However not wanting to have it in the house they shoved it outside where its stitches came undone and its insides were hanging out. She could have been saved but they didn't want to pay the money.

I was heart broken for ages, and cried every night. Even now, as I turn 16 I still miss it.

I remember one night a few months after I was feeling sorrow for the poor cat on my bed as I was patting my dog. Suddenly cold drafts were coming. Now because it was a while ago I'm not 100% sure if the draft thing happened, because it happened a long time ago but from what I remember it did.

However what I do remember, did happen for real. My dog jumped off my lap and started barking at thin air. I found that really weird, and shuffled back a little bit. But then I felt as if a cat was rubbing against my bare foot. I didn't see anything, just thin air. I wasn't sure if it was a ghost or not but being curious, I put my hand out. I felt something go under my hand and rub against it. However it didn't last long as it disappeared as soon as it came, and my dog returned to normal.

You may not believe me, but I still hold onto this precious memory of my small cat saying goodbye to me, and not to be sad of her departure.

Shadows of the Elderly,"Indiana, United States",Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: Shadows of the Elderly

W ell I've always had strange things happen, come to think of it, a lot of time in my life. I do not consider myself a ghost hunter and am under experience of seeking the paranormal, it seeks me. One of the more interesting periods is when I lived in a seniors/disabled community with my mother.

Location: Village Green Apartments, Decatur, IN. 1998-Current.

Now when I said I lived with my mom, I didn't live in the same apartment with her, I was a neighbor, able to live out there due to a heart condition from birth.

Firstly, a lot of people in this complex have died at home, sometimes they aren't found immediately. It is a sad thing.

The former resident of my mom's apartment, the one she currently lives in had a woman die in the home, and for a short while after my mom moved in there, doors had a habit of going shut, gently mind you. Nothing to get spooked over really, I just think the previous tenant wasn't quite ready to leave.

My apartment next door though, I fully believe is cursed. I knew to of the previous occupants. One a lonely and not completely sane elderly woman who had serious bouts of depression. She was moved to a nursing home where she passed away. By the way, her home was crowded, too much stuff, and was dirty. This is important later.

The next occupants were an elderly couple, who had a lot of things in this small apartment, including a piano. The home was not clean either, they too, were moved out and to a nursing home.

I then took possession of the home, my mother's health was failing and I wanted to be closer to her, to look after her. None of my furniture seemed to fit, I had trouble keeping the apartment clean to my liking, I suffered depression, suicidal thoughts, mood swings, nothing could go right. I wasn't there a year.

Then a man moved in next door, and the theme continued, depression, uncleanliness, unhappy with life. He moved after a turbulent year.

Now a woman battling cancer, her brother and his wife live there. The wife is reacting the worst to the apartment, there's fighting, depression, the wife's tried to commit suicide at least twice since living here, and they've only been there a few months.

Occurrences in my mom's apartment have not been limited to just the previous resident, there are what she calls ""skitters"" little shadows that wiggle across the floor, I've seen these upon going into a darkened room, they swarm across the floor and disappear. She thinks they are woodland animal spirits. Incidentally, She lives right by the forest there.

She had an experience in the middle of the night, calling me, terrified. Something woke her up, she felt a darkness in her room, she in her words say it felt like Satan himself stuck his head in her room. She prayed until it went away. But she was severely shaken by it. (she has had this happen before and considers it to be demonic spirits sent by someone, they are usually accompanied with an unexplainable sulfur odor that permeates the room, dispels only with prayer.)

At times you can see shadows moving outside in the dark, but there's no source, just a human-shaped shadow. One night that happened to me, I was sitting there, drinking coffee in the kitchen, we were talking at her table, when a shadow passed the window. This was at night, bright kitchen lights shining out, but it looked like someone walked in front of the windows, no one was out there. But the weirder part, as this happened, I felt a finger tip brush up my fore-arm, which had just been resting on the table nearest the window. I was freaked out by this, never been touched by a spirit before.

Another experience was in the middle of the day, springtime, bright beautiful sunlight, birds singing. My mother, son and I were heading out to take a walk, I glanced down the sidewalk to a neighbor's car, seeing a man in a brown tweed suit and a hat standing there, he looks right at me, smiles, tips his hat, I figured he was over visiting the neighbor man Fred or was out for a walk. Then he steps off the curb by the parked car into the parking lot, disappearing into thin air.

I could have wet my pants, I asked my mom, who was right beside me, if she saw the man, she said all she saw was a shadow by the car. I felt kind of hysterical after that. He didn't seem threatening, just a kindly old man. He looked real, he was solid, the light didn't pass through him... But he didn't have a shadow, well not on the ground. I know what I saw, but part of my mind wants to doubt what I saw that day too.

My mom swears she saw a white wolf out there in the middle of winter, I can remember going out to look for tracks in the snow, of course, I couldn't find any.

There's a huge doe that comes up in early morning, late evening. There's an oak tree that has some kind of nature spirits attached to it behind my mom's apartment. There are times of going outside, you look into the woods, it feels like something malevolent is watching you.

The woods are quiet when this takes place, it is a horrible feeling, insecure, afraid, and it doesn't want you anywhere near the woods. I challenged it one night, told it I wasn't going to be scared of it any more, and that it should stop. I haven't been bothered by it since, not directly, it seems to have retreated further into the woods, instead of just right there in the edge. It isn't always there, sometimes there's just this bright exuberance from the woods that makes you smile.

I got a frantic call from my mom in the evening, around 6:30pm or so wanting to know if I was alright, She heard a wolf howl. She swears it. It was found out later, at the time she heard the howl, a pair of men, different apartments, both passed away out there. One dropped over from a sudden heart-attack while showering, another was an hour later of natural causes. We were both shaken by that.

It is interesting, just the things that happen out there alone. But then you stop and think of all the emotions, and energy, and how many of those people have died at home, it's no wonder stuff happens.

I am interested to hear ideas and theories from the more experienced out there, any ideas what all this is? And why?

An Oppressive Encounter,"Indiana, United States",Old Hags / Night Attacks / Sleep Paralysis,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Old Hags / Night Attacks / Sleep Paralysis :: An Oppressive Encounter

I t was the middle of the day on a saturday last summer, and for some odd reason I started feeling very tired, like I should take a nap. Odd, since I don't usually ever take naps, being that I'm a energetic teenager. So, anyway I lay down on the couch, and before I know it I'm drifting off, then all the sudden I feel a very evil presence around me, like an impending doom, something was not right.

I am suddenly paralyzed, and cannot move. I look around and everything looks the same in the house except it's all dark and eerie and I see an evil entity standing before me, it straddles on top of me, and presses down on my chest. I try to move, but I can't. I start feeling breathless, suddenly while the entity is on top of me, my eyes close, and I see colors swirling around, and hear the sound of babies crying.

Then, I pray in my head to God to help me, I feel the entity get angrier and leave. I feel an over whelming sense of good come over me. Then all the sudden I fall asleep. And I wake up a few minutes later. When I wake up I feel very tired, drained, freaked out, and I look around the house looking for anyone that could have been on top of me, because I truly felt some one on top of me. I thought maybe some one was really hurting me, while I was hallucinating. I find that my mother is still gone, and I am the only one in the house.

I can't come to grips of why, but this has happened to me, with different entities, etc, about three more times since them. If anyone knows why, please help. Thanks.

Teenage Ouija Board Use,"Nebraska, United States",Ouija Board / Seances,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Ouija Board / Seances :: Teenage Ouija Board Use

I have been wanting to write my experiences for a long time, it is just one of those things that are hard to talk about. But as of lately I have been thinking about it more and more and have even had a few nightmares. I think another reason I haven't shared was because now that I am older and have children of my own, I know that playing with a Ouija board is just asking for trouble. I just wonder if anyone has had similar experiences. So, to start I have to kind of explain a little. Sorry it is long but I had to tell you everything.

When I was a teenager I had 2 best friends (Sharrie and Beth). They were the kind of friends that you did everything with and would do anything for. Sharrie and I were inseparable since I moved back to Nebraska from Texas, and Beth and I had been friends since Kindergarten. We kind of bonded since we had the same name growing up. They were the kind of friends that were just as close as sisters.

The first few times we ever played with the Ouija Board were just kind of fun playful times (or so I thought). Nothing to out of the ordinary, Sharrie had a board that she had in her room that we would use at sleep overs. I never quite figured how they worked, I was young and naive - we would ask it about boys and things. It always amazed that whatever the name was that I had in my head at the time, the board would always spell. It was always like it was reading my mind. Beth was a year older and braver so she would ask crazier question - which I will explain later.

I remember we even asked the name of the person we were talking to, it told us that his name was Yuri. So, one day we were using it at my house, and my dad came home and found it. My father being pretty religious was very upset and said no one would be using one of those at his house and he threw the board in our Oscar (trash can) and that was that. A few weeks went by and he came in the house all mad and yelling that he told me it needed to stay in the trash. Well, it was out of the trash and on the table in the garage. Crazy - I promptly took it back down to Sharrie's and left it there...

The next time and last time that we played with a Ouija board was at a slumber party. Sharrie was at a dance so I went to a party with Beth for one of the girls from her school. Sharrie and I went to the public school in town and Beth went to the Catholic school. So we were playing with the board and all the girls were taking turns playing, I think we were going 2 at a time. So, it was mine and Beth's turn - I will never ever forget this for the rest of my life.

Beth asked (I don't know why - we were just 14 and stupid) the board how and when we were going to die. I told you she was always asking crazier things! So, the thing that I can never forget is that the board told us that we were both going to die young, and Beth went a little bit further and asked how. It said that she was going to die in water. At this time I am freaked out, I hadn't really wanted to play, and Sharrie was there to get us. So we of course told Sharrie all about it and tried to laugh it off.

Fast forward 6 years. Beth and I had both graduated we were still friends, we still had a bond we just didn't talk like we used to. We both had grown up, gotten boyfriends, Beth even had a baby and then got married.

One day in November a girlfriend came over, asked me to sit down. She proceeded to tell me that Beth and her husband had been in a car crash and had hit a patch of black ice and lost control, hitting a truck head on. They were killed instantly, their daughter was in the back seat, and was only saved because of proper positioning of the infant carrier. I remember feeling like I was hit in the stomach and had the wind knocked out of me when I heard this. Afterwards you kind of go in a non reality mode where you don't want to believe something happened. Then the sorrow and anger comes when the loss finally hits you. I can never imagine how their family felt and how they came to grips with a loss like that, 2 young people taken away like that.

Life around us has gone on, but you never forget. I got married, Sharrie was my maid of honor in my wedding, but Beth was there in spirit. We had a candle lit and a rose for her also. So time has past and a few friends and I share memories and that night with the Ouija board comes up. Was it just mere coincidence the Beth died at a young age and on ice (water). So then nightmares started. I wonder about my own mortality. I have realized that I to was told that I will die young. Does this mean 30 or 50? I have children of my own now, will I be taken away like she was?

As of lately I have had a few health scares and have been in the hospital for cancer testing. A small comfort was that Beth's mother was my recovery nurse in the hospital. Scariest 10 days of one's life is waiting for test results. Now I have been diagnosed with a pre cancerous condition, and will have testing done 2-3 a year.

So, now I ask you can a spirit in a Ouija board predict the future, or was it just an evil thing said to 2 young naive teenagers messing around with something they should not have been messing with? I realize this is not the average story written on this web site, but I would love to hear thoughts from all of you who have had more experience with this.

Broken Glass and a Laugh,"Oregon, United States",Apparitions / Voices / Touches,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Apparitions / Voices / Touches :: Broken Glass and a Laugh

I t was early morning when I suddenly got a chill that woke me up. I'm one of those persons who hates the cold so I sleep with three blankets and the heater on but I was still cold. I pulled the blankets tightly against me to stay warm. I fell back asleep again but this time I was woken up my the sound of a voice. It was the same voice that I always hear (voice from bathroom attack ) I looked around my room and saw nothing. Everything was normal.

I laid back down thinking that it was just freaking out when a candle holder that sits on my shelf shattered. I jumped out of bed and saw the glass on the other side of the room and the candle was still on my shelf. I could stay in my room because I was too afraid so I was going to jump in bed with my dad but when I got to his room, he had already gone to work. I was alone.

I grabbed my blanket and sat on the couch hoping that it was going to be ok and nothing else would happen. I started hear a laugh, like a man's laugh and I knew it had to have come from whatever had been bothering me. It was far away at first but seemed to be getting closer when finally it just stopped. It hasn't been know just to leave so fast so I was afraid that something was going to happen. Fifteen minutes later a car pulled into my drive way. I was scared but knew it was only my sister and brother being dropped off by my mom for school.

Rock House Haunting,"Missouri, United States",Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: Rock House Haunting

T his is my first story on the site. It happened (I believe) when I was three years old. My mother told me this one, so I am not very exact about the details of the experience. Back when I was three, (1996) we lived in a two-story house. My brother and I slept downstairs, and I don't know where my mom and dad slept. Well, my mother would check on my brother and I every night.

One night she came in our room and was standing near my bed; she felt someone tap her shoulder and she thought it was my dad, who may have awoken. Though, when she turned around to face him, there was nobody to be seen. This was first to happen.

The next experience was mine and my brother's. I enjoyed going up stairs in that rock house. I guess it was because of the feeling of being in the air. I was up there one day, and I went into the closet and felt someone push me from behind. I turned around and saw no one there. Being a three-year old, I ran downstairs. Similar occurrences happened, though these I either don't remember or were never told. (I have HORRIBLE memory).

My mom was suspecting there was something supernatural going on in the house, so she called my cousin John to come check out the house. He went into our room, and nothing strange happened. He checked upstairs, and again, nothing out of the ordinary. Until we began walking back downstairs. My brother, Kris, who was seven at the time, fell (very forcefully) down the stairs. There were at least 20 stairs or so. My cousin, John, ran to Kris, picked him up, and ran outside. (along with everyone else).

John did not like that house. My mother finally hired a priest to come and bless the house in the name of Jesus Christ. My dad was at work the whole time. That year we moved out of the house. (Not because of the ghost).

Ghost Girl - Mixed Feelings,"New York, United States",Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: Ghost Girl - Mixed Feelings

N ow I have only lived at my current residence for about three years now and before this I have had previous encounters with paranormal activities and such, but never one quite like this. I know only a few basics about my current house, that a girl late teens to early twenties (17-25) died here. I have heard that it was of an overdose of prescription medication although details are hard to come by.

Either way I know that soon after her death the people who lived with her (as far as I know it was her parents) moved out of the house with little warning. This may not seem strange, but coupled with the events I have experienced I think I can see why they left.

The first encounter was the very first day I moved in, we were unloading everything as quickly as possible, just setting it into the rooms. At the time I was to inhabit the smallest room of the house, which was her bedroom. The room itself was colder than the rest of the house, odd since it was closely connected to the heater. Every time I entered the room I got a chill down my spine and would turn, expecting to find someone watching me from the doorway as if to ask what I thought I was doing. I shrugged it off and unpacked, thinking I was just tired.

A few months after my first experience I was doing laundry in the basement, I was on my way up the stairs and heard someone specifically say, ""Wait..."" And lay a hand on my shoulder. I was in the house alone and I was rather terrified. The pressure on my shoulder went away and I hurried upstairs.

Later that night I awoke, thinking I heard someone speaking. I put it off as my rabbit making noise in his cage. The next morning my mother commented something strange. She said that late at night she had heard a girl talking, she thought it was me because no one else was in the house that night. She looked in on me, fast asleep and tried to shrug it off. When she thought about it again, she said it very much sounded like it came through the vents that run through the house. My sister, my mother, myself and my friends have heard this voice on occasion from the vents, just talking, the words unable to be distinguished.

From time to time I feel her watching me and I say her because the presence feels it, sometimes I smell shampoo, like her hair is by my face. I was feeling irritated and upset one day, and I lashed out at her presence when she tried to comfort me, Yelling ""go away ___"" the __is for her name, I recall yelling it and I recall stopping and saying what? But the name disappeared from my mind as quickly as it entered. She's left me alone since then, still there but ignoring me, but sometimes I can feel her loneliness when I'm close.

Has anyone else ever had this happen? I was a little skeptical at first, but I honestly think she's here, especially after all of this and more that's happened.

High-heeled Leather Shoes,Philippines,Apparitions / Voices / Touches,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Apparitions / Voices / Touches :: High-heeled Leather Shoes

B efore I tell you my story, first let me clear things up. I am not paranormal sensitive in ANYWAY. I'm LOGICAL. Not a big fan of religion. In fact I consider myself to be a ghost ""repellant"" (if you want to know why e-mail me). I wouldn't know that I'm in a haunted place unless someone told me.

But I do have one, and I say ONE, weird experience. (I'm not a good storyteller so please bear with me)

It was back in 2002, I was 14 at the time, my grandmother just died. And here in the Philippines we held wakes in the house of the deceased. Relatives, friends and neighbors are welcome to visit to pay their respect (and some visit for free food).

It was probably close to midnight, I was in the room where the food we served our guests were stored (i.e. Peanuts, chips, candies, bread, drinks and stuff like that). I just sneaked in there for a snack. This room had no door, it only had a curtain that's stretched just below the knees. And it was the last room in the hallway, the entryway of this room is just beside the bathroom door.

As I was scurrying around boxes looking for food, I heard the distinct sound of heels hitting the floor. It was getting louder as it neared. I was waiting for it, and it came, I saw 2 legs wearing high-heeled leather shoes (ones like what private school students wear) walked pass the curtain and into the bathroom. I was curious but never left where I was standing and waited for ""her"" to come out and ""she"" never did. I didn't feel anything weird or scary, just out of place.

So I went after ""her"". To my surprise the lights were off and nobody was in, I even checked behind the door to be sure. I went outside to check the daughter of our house keeper to see if she's still wearing her school uniform, and she's not, and why would she? It's close to midnight and she comes home at 5 pm. And believe me when I say NO ONE was wearing anything beyond shirts, shorts and slippers. People here would think you're crazy if you wear anything formal to a provincial wake. And besides, the bathroom ""she"" entered was broken, nothing but a bucket to catch the drippings of a broken faucet was in there. Why would anyone enter there? And even if it was a guest why didn't it came out?

Another thing bothering me is why didn't I feel anything, it felt very normal. And I couldn't have imagined it because the curtain moved as the legs passed.

Feeling of Sadness at Uncle Bill & Aunt Vera's House,"Florida, United States",Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: Feeling of Sadness at Uncle Bill & Aunt Vera's House

T his story come from Cheifland, Fl where my family visited often. When I was younger we would have family gatherings at my Uncle Bills yearly so we could all play catch up with the rest of the family. It all started in about christmas time when Mema and Aunt Mildred came down from Massachusetts to spend the rest of winter here.

We went to Uncle Bills almost every weekend, mainly to go fishing with different family members, we all stayed at Uncle Bills house. At night I have a hard time sleeping as it is but at someone else house it's almost impossible for me to fall asleep at all.

One year when we went there I had gotten up in the middle of the night to do my business, I seen a dark shadow go into the living room and just disappear, I never thought too much of it because I was really sleepy. Later that day I was outside playing with my cousins, and the adults were across the street making a huge bonfire for later, when my cousin Tisa came running out of the house screaming and inconsolably crying, she said that she was touched on her shoulder, and when she turned around no one was there and she just freaked out and ran, and everyone chalked it up to little kid, big imagination.

Well as years started to pass we started to see more stuff happen, like you would hear footsteps at night, or the broom that was hanging up in the closet would fall, and once I understood more about what was going on I finally asked Uncle Bill what was going on and he told me that back in the 1800s a family had passed from dt and never left and that was probably the things we all see and hear, but to this day I still don't see why they would appear in a shadow form, because from my understanding, shadow people are evil but I never got a bad feeling from them just an overwhelming feeling of sadness.

Hauntings in Jacksonville,"Connecticut, United States",A Haunted Life,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: A Haunted Life :: Hauntings in Jacksonville

M y name is Clay. I am originally from Jacksonville, FL. I moved into a condo in Jacksonville with my family when I was eight. The house was empty except for one of the bedrooms. My bedroom closet had a Ouija board left in it. The previous owners wife liked to play with the Ouija board but for some reason she left it behind.

I started schooling and came home regularly and was home alone for a few hours until my older sister came home from school followed later by my mom. Strange noises from up stairs started happening like someone pacing around. I would yell hello, and start naming off anyone who could be upstairs and no one would answer and the pacing would stop. The noise would occur often after school and would change way it would sound.

One time the noise was of someone running around almost from room to room, and would end with a door slamming somewhere. The scariest moment was when the pacing started briefly then ended with what sounded like a bowling ball dropping to the floor. At the time my sister was three and I was playing and having her chase me around. I ran upstairs thinking she would follow while chasing me and a girl was coming up the stairs but it wasn't her, this girl was around the same age but her clothes were a blue dress almost like what was worn hundreds of years before. It didn't take me long to realize the girl wasn't my sister and the girl vanished through the wall as if it was a hallway.

Over time the noises occurred but I was young and got used to it living in the house for so long it was almost normal, and I never knew why when I told people they didn't believe me.

A few years went by in the house and surprisingly no noise was heard, the ghost seemed to just vanish as if they never were there. It wasn't until September of 1999 when the apparitions returned after not being around for a couple of years. My bedroom where the Ouija board was discovered when first moving in six years earlier had a ghost in the room with me. This one is the only one that really freaked me out worse than any other paranormal event in the house.

I was laying in my water bed and I got a paranoid feeling that there was something standing next to me. In the dark room there was only a street light that gleamed through the room. I saw what looked to be a hooded apparition no face all black, about six and a half feet tall and the form came through real good when it passed the window where the light passed around it. It appeared to be gliding over to the closet which was on the other side of my feet right side of the room. Then I glided back over to where it began, which was four feet from my face, then it glided back to the closet, then I watched it start to glide to where my door is (again opposite side of my feet but left side).

The problem is that my feet was hanging off the end of the bed and the apparition had to go through it to get to where it was heading and I watched it move across towards the wall by the door and I was to scared to move and right before it crossed my feet I hid my face under a pillow and my feet went from feeling the room temperature which was warm in my room eighty degrees to a freezing bitter cold then back to the room temperature. I then got up and ran out of the room not caring if the apparition was still there or not. For some reason now I have a foot phobia where before I wasn't bothered by feet, maybe there's a connection? I also sleep under a pillow, been like that ever since.

It started getting worse for everyone in the house. I went from being the only one that could hear the ghost, and I seen two apparitions already before my younger sister encountered a ghost in the same bedroom I stayed in before I moved to Connecticut. The door in the room was closed and something cracked it open, then my sister heard a little girl's voice say ""Amanda come play"". Amanda looked, rolled over and asked my older sister Alison who she shared a room with ""did you hear that?"" in which Alison replied she did.

I moved backed for a year and the ghost were still present in the house. I heard almost every night loud pacing up and down the stairs. It lasted for several months, I eventually had to yell shut up so they would stop and I could get some sleep. I told my mom about what I hear every night on the staircase and she shrugged it off as she did with all my other stories.

One night when she was home by herself she heard something running up the stairs, she thought it was an intruder in the house and she said she laid there helplessly waiting for the intruder to break into her room, but nothing happened and there was no one in the house.

Some time before that when my mom stayed in one of the three rooms in the house (the one next to the Ouija bedroom) she actually saw an apparition at the end of her bed. Sitting at the end of her bed was an old woman looked of Native American decent glaring at my mom, then she disappeared, then my mom did something like sit where the apparition was and said out loud ""this is my house now this is my room"" then went back to sleep.

She had the house blessed however, shortly after the staircase incident, unfortunately it didn't work because the doors would open on their own, sounds of walking around in my room was happening on a regular basis, thank God no apparition to go with it! There were pictures taken in the house that has orbs in it, though no apparition was ever caught on film in the house.

We now live in Connecticut where my mom is originally from. We moved to apartments called Mohegan Park apartments located in my hometown of Norwich, which is located minutes from both the Casinos here in Connecticut. Nothing happened in the apartment. There was no apparitions, no poltergeist, no walking around, or voices calling your name. It felt good to live in peace. We moved in those apartments in 2002 and lived there until 2006.

I moved out on my own and now live at another apartment complex in Norwich. The problem is that for the last two summers I have been fascinated with the supernatural, remembering what happened in Florida. My friends like to drive through back roads supposed to haunted by ghost. One road in particular is Hells Hollow road. The road is located outside Plainfield,CT. I took pictures off a lot which is located off the road while hanging out with friends and a very defined fog of a small person with a decomposed face was in the picture with us, and in several pictures which sparked my interest in ghost hunting.

I've went to several graveyards and experienced different feelings each time. My interest stuck with Hells Hollow. I've heard what sounded like Native tribes in the woods making noises with their mouths. I have also seen a large dark floating figure float from tree tops across the sky and into other tree tops (and I am positive it wasn't a bird). A woman named Maude was murdered about three-hundred years ago there accused of being a witch, as well as a young Native girl and her family by British troops in the same area. I took a picture in Hells Hollow, and the picture shows thousands of orbs and what looks like Native Americans being slaughtered or tied up. I still have this picture.

I also visited Maude's grave and took pictures there late at night and took friends and my cousin from Florida there and video tapped the event. A few days later while driving home from work I felt this pushing on the back of my seat. I got out of work at midnight. My friends thought it was weird, and a few nights later we hang out in a circle lot for a few minutes, then we got out open the trunk to get something from the back. Keep in mind both doors were left open. As soon as we opened the trunk something invisible ran from the trunk pushing objects aside then my driver side door slammed shut.

Since visiting Maude's grave and taking pictures of Hells Hollow trying to capture ghost this past summer, strange things been happening at my apartment. The trash can with a hinged lid appears to be hit by something and move back and forth until it stops. Doors pop open on there own and then close themselves. When I sleep at night I wake up feeling nervous and I feel like something is watching me. I feel like something is watching me, and tries to invade my mind with fear and anxiety that there is something around the corner. Vividly loud, evil looking beings enter my mind sometimes before I open a door as if I am being warned or just being attacked mentally to put me in fear.

I am fascinated by the paranormal after my experience as a child as well as what I experienced searching for them. I found that what I was interested in from my past was probably evil of no good, and by ghost hunting, I might be bringing that evil back into my life. I try to understand what I can't explain, and are they following me?

The Denbigh,"Texas, United States",Psychic / Medium,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Psychic / Medium :: The Denbigh

F irst of all I've had several experiences with talking boards as well. I've had two UFO encounters in my life. I can communicate with the spirit world - that's a gift I have. I've had at least two homes that had ghosts. But this story is different. This is the first time I have physically seen ghosts. I've waiting years to actually see ghostly apparitions. I have always believed in them.

I went camping in Port Bolivar Texas at the bird sanctuary during Mardi Gras at Galveston. I wasn't interested in the Mardi Gras crowds so I convinced my boyfriend to take the ferry to Port Bolivar for a romantic evening on the beach. As things started heating up we decided to take a sleeping bag and some pillows to the bird observation deck to camp on the deck. It was Feb. 2 and 3 2008 around midnight. As soon as I stepped up on the deck a big white owl flew right by my head. Then the whole beach just started coming alive with activity. I seen a ship run around that had been burned and there were people scuffling off and on the ship - taking all the ships contents off the ship. The men were all in uniform. The ladies were in Victorian style clothes and bonnets and hooded capes. I seen everything in color. A confederate officer walked right up to me, he was bald holding his hat with a white beard. Most of the faces were just shadows. The reason I say confederate officer is because when I got home I did extensive research on the area and what I saw was The Denbigh, a civil war blockade runner. It ran aground and was sunk right there where we camped.

The images were coming so fast it was overwhelming - truly awesome. The images lasted all night until dawn. I'll never forget it. It was incredible. Needless to say my boyfriend didn't get any that night.

St. Augustine Ghost,"Florida, United States",Ghost Tours & Haunted Hotels,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Ghost Tours & Haunted Hotels :: St. Augustine Ghost

A bout 7 years ago a girlfriend and I went to stay at my Aunt's condo for a vacation in St. Augustine, FL (a.k.a. The Country's Oldest City). We had decided to do the Walking Ghost Tour one evening through the Old City. The tour guide brought us through different areas and explained the different sightings that had been reported through the years. He even relayed an experience of his own which involved hearing Spanish soldiers march through the streets really early in the morning. He could smell their sweat and hear them speaking but didn't see a thing. Needless to say he was quite spooked.

Towards the end of the tour my friend says to me, ""Did you see that?"" I said, ""see what?"" She said she had been looking in a shop window that was closed for the night and the light turned on and then off again. Believing she had probably just spooked herself from the tour I didn't pay much attention. Surely it must have been an employee that was locking up for the night.

At the end of the tour we returned to our rental car to go back to the condo. I had parked under a light in a parking lot nearby. As I started the engine, the light in the parking lot went out. We both jumped and then started laughing thinking it was probably some timer on the light. We returned to the condo without incident. That evening I decided to stay up and read. My friend fell asleep early. She and I both slept in the same room to enjoy the spectacular view of the ocean through the picture window. While I was reading, the hall light went out. I thought maybe the bulb had blown but I was getting a little unnerved due to our earlier experiences with various lights turning off. I put my book down and attempted to go to sleep. As I was laying there, the light came back on. Now I was really scared. I did not wake my friend because I didn't want to scare her.

In the middle of the night my friend woke me up. She said, ""Jenn, something strange just happened. I woke up and the light was on. Then two seconds later it was off. Now it is back on..."" I told her that I had experienced the same thing earlier. I tried to reason in my mind that it was just faulty wiring. Finally we fell back to sleep. The next morning I went downstairs to make coffee and on my way down the stairs I felt like I had stepped through a wall of static electricity. All the hairs on my arm literally stood up. It was really freaky. My Aunt called later on in the day to check in on us. I asked her at the time if the light in the hall had a history of turning on and off. She said no. We left St. Augustine not knowing what we had experienced. The condo is within walking distance of Old Fort Matanzas. Matanzas in Spanish means ""slaughter..."" Many lost their lives there during battles between the Spanish, French, and Indians. Could it be that one of these lost souls followed us back? We'll never know.

Old KKK Church,"Florida, United States",Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: Old KKK Church

M y experiences started back when I was thirteen years old. Though they do not haunt me anymore my experiences have left an impression that has kept me with an open-mind where ever I go. My aunt Mable lived in an old house way out in the country, and I used to go and spend the weeks and weekends every chance I got. Once my aunt started renovating her house is when all the activity started to happen.

The first experience I had at the house with a poltergeist, I was sitting at the dinner table eating lunch with my cousin Josh, and next thing we know we see the front door open and close, we hear loud footsteps walking from the front door to the kitchen and the refrigerator door opens and closes, then the cabinets above the kitchen sink opens and closes, then we hear more footsteps and the backdoor opens and closes. We both looked at each other and turned very pale.

The following weekend is when thing started getting really weird. At this point my aunt was in the middle of renovations and we were all sitting in the living room watching TV when we heard the dog barking out front and he wouldn't stop. After a few minutes we decided to go outside and check it out. When we walked out we saw the dog barking up at a tree and when we looked up we saw a black man and two black children hanging in a tree. At this point I was really freaking at having to spend the night at their house because my parents were out of town.

That night I had a hard time getting to sleep but after a couple of hours I finally drifted off. The next morning I woke up before anyone like usual and was just laying there when the next thing I know the same black man I saw hanging in the tree came walking through the door, as he started walking and passed right by me I looked in the kitchen and saw the same two little boys as well, except this time I could see that the two boys had holes in their head. Once everyone was up I told them about my personal experience and told them how freaked out I was and my aunt mable thought it was time to get some help.

A few weeks later my aunt had put a hold on the renovations and started talking to a local psychic and researcher and asked if she could help. She said she could help and she drove out to my aunts house. When she got to the house she said that she had done some research on the house and come to find out it used to be an old kkk church, and she had records of black people being murdered there.

Among the people murdered she found a father and his two sons that were killed by getting tarred and feathered and beat to death. Which freaked us all out because that was exactly what we saw. She told us that there was another ghost in the house as well as a poltergeist, I couldn't believe it at first, that she was telling us everything we had seen before even getting a chance to talk to her. After walking around the house telling us different things she told us that she had some bad news and asked if she could go outside. We all went outside and she told us that she think there was bodies buried on my aunt property and showed us where. We started digging the next day and found a few bones but nothing else. We don't know if they are human or not but once the renovations were complete no one has seen or heard anything.

Please forgive me in my spelling and punctuation. This is my first time writing my experience instead of just telling. From those days forward I have had a new look on life and I feel like I can sense things a lot better when I enter a new place. Thank you.

Supernatural Activities at the Old Apartment,"Massachusetts, United States",Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: Supernatural Activities at the Old Apartment

A lmost 10 years ago I rented an apartment in an area of Worcester, MA called Quinsigamond Village. It was in a three decker house that once was home to many generations of Swedish immigrants that worked in the mills nearby. Thinking I had a really sweet deal on rent for such a huge place with so much charm, I quickly signed the rent papers and moved in.

This place boasted an old cast iron bathtub with the lion's feet and a built-in china cabinet. It didn't take long to realize that things weren't exactly right in this place. I was single at the time and lived by myself. My first experiences started off as little things; a fawcett left on, a picture I had hung being upside down, or a coffee cup I could have sworn being left on the kitchen table would be in the bathroom, etc. I attributed these experiences to my own carelessness but still felt they were kind of odd.

One night I awoke to the phone ringing in the kitchen only. The phone in the bedroom did not ring and the caller ID was not picking up the call. I still thought this was kind of odd but again wrote it off as just one of the quirks of living in an old building with old wiring. I awoke another night to the sounds of shattering glass. I ran to the window and did not see a thing. It was so loud that I thought someone else surely would be up at their window investigating, but there was no one. The next morning I inspected the area and didn't find so much as a shard anywhere.

A few months later I was getting up to make coffee and felt a cold breeze. It was the middle of winter and the window was open in the pantry. Being an old house, the kitchen had a long walk-in pantry with a window at the end. My Dad tried to tell me that the vibration of traffic going down the street had raised the window. I really wanted to believe this. It happened again but this time in the bathroom. I would also hear what sounded like the front door opening and upon inspection would find the door still locked like I had left it.

Perhaps the scariest things that happened were one day while home from work sick, I was sitting in the living room watching a movie. The sofa was against one side of the wall with the closet door next to it. All of a sudden I saw something out of the corner of my eye move along the baseboard with great speed. It appeared to be white. It disappeared behind the chair in the opposite corner and then reappeared just as fast from the other side before disappearing under the TV stand. My blood went absolutely cold. I have never felt a sensation like that before and I hope to never again. I stayed on the sofa with my eyes peeled to the TV stand. I wanted to believe it was a mouse and that maybe I had spooked it instead of the other way around.

After what seem like an eternity, I mustered up the guts to inspect the back of the TV stand. I hopped onto the chair and tilted the stand forward to see if there was anything behind there. I couldn't see anything. I knew by my body's reaction that I had just witnessed something very unusual. I started to cry. I didn't know who to call. Who would believe this? I also became angry. I walked from room to room and called out to whoever it was that they had to leave. I also recited the Lord's Prayer out loud. That night I dreamt that I was chasing something that I couldn't see around the apartment. When I woke the next day I felt as if the air had lifted. Unfortunately it did not last.

About a week later I came home from work and was making the trek up to the third floor when I started to feel very uneasy. I inserted the key into the door and a large spark flew out of the metal door knob. It literally left a red mark on my thumb and hurt like heck. I walked into the kitchen and felt a very awful presence. I could not see a thing but I suddenly felt terrified. Again I recited the Lord's Prayer out loud, the entire time thinking that I was going to be lifted off the ground by some unseen force. I was actually holding on to the back of the chair. Finally it went. I slept with the lights on and wondered if I should just get the heck out of there.

The last really frightening thing that happened before things started to die down, happened that Spring. Being young and single, I spent a lot of time going to bars and clubs in Boston. I would pack a bag, head east on the Mass Pike and then crash on a friend's sofa until Sunday. I had three ferrets at the time and before leaving I would make sure their cage was secure and that they had plenty of food and water for the weekend.

I returned one Sunday and when I opened the kitchen door, there was an empty milk jug sitting upright in the center of the floor directly in view of the door. It had somehow moved over the hard wood floors and over the lip of the throw rug I had under the kitchen table. The milk jug had been in a box I kept for recycling. Then one of my ferrets walked by. All three were out of their cage. I went to their room and found the center door of their condo cage wide open. I never used that door as they were always at the top or the bottom -never the middle. They had no access to their food or water all weekend. Had one of them pushed the door open somehow? Had they managed to work the milk jug out of the box, scoot it across the floor, over the rug while it remained upright? There could have been a logical explanation for this one I suppose but to this day it has me baffled.

I moved out in September 2001. At that point most things had stopped. I had worked with a man that claimed to be a psychic. He had a near death experience after being struck by lightening and says he was left with these gifts. He told me that my apartment was a highway for spirits and they were attracted to a grid that ran underneath the building. I don't even read my horoscope so this was all very bizarre to me. I don't know why I even stayed there so long. I guess I'm just very stubborn (or crazy).

When I finally packed up the living room during my move to Arizona, I moved the TV stand completely. There, tucked in a corner underneath the stand, was a little white power ball... The kind that you get out of a bubblegum machine for a quarter. I felt a shiver run down my spine. Needless to say, the power ball stayed behind in the house. I stayed in touch with the other folks occupying the other floors for awhile. Although one lady admitted there were spirits there, I did not hear of anyone else experiencing what I did. I've since lost touch. Thanks for reading. I know this was very long.

A Large Glowing Orb,"Texas, United States",Photographs / Videos / EVP,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Photographs / Videos / EVP :: A Large Glowing Orb

T his is a photo I took, using a disposable camera. I was visiting the ""Old Waverly"" cemetery, here in Texas; photographing graves for a cemetery photo book, that I was working on. As you can see, where the picture was aimed, it's not really focusing on any particular grave. When I had finished taking pictures with my digital camera, I took out the disposable camera to shoot some pictures, to send to a friend.

Well, as I walked around, looking at what to photograph next, something just compelled me to stop between these trees, and take a picture. It was a weird feeling/experience to come over me.

When I got the film developed, I was surprised to see this large glowing orb. To me, it looks like a comet jetting through. I've posted this picture on another paranormal site, and took a lot of ""abuse"" over it being a strand of hair or dirt.

Well, I have extremely long hair (knee-length) and when I am photographing something, I make sure to pull my hair back, to prevent any strays from getting in the pictures, as I had done that day, since after all, my digital pictures where being used in a book, so they had to be clear and professional in quality. One person commented to me, that it's a blond hair in the picture; my hair is dyed burgundy, not blond.

Also, if you notice on the ""tail"" of the orb, you can see through it, now if it was a hair, I would think a hair would be solid, you wouldn't see the tree limbs through it. And lastly, it was a cloudy day, raining on and off (but it was not raining anytime during the photos I was taking); the sun wasn't out, so I have ruled out, that it is not a sun spot.

I just found it interesting, and was thrilled to see it appear, (since I was strangely compelled to take a photo at that moment in time). Perhaps it was a spirit following me around the cemetery?

Jasmine by the Window and the Old Man's Rocking Chair,Greece,Psychic / Medium,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Psychic / Medium :: Jasmine by the Window and the Old Man's Rocking Chair

R hodes is known as the island devoted to Apollo - the ancient Sun God. Winter seems to have almost forgotten this part of the world as it barely ""touches"" it. If one excludes the boiling hot summers from June until mid-October and the torrential rain and thunderstorms from January until late February, you can enjoy the bright sunshine and the refreshing breeze throughout the rest of the year. For that, spending time close to nature can have a healing effect and, as you might have guessed, the garden at Anima was, is, and always will be a sight for soar eyes.

With that in mind, I decided to turn one of the store-rooms into a study and a personal living room and thus, having a good excuse, spend most of my free time at the garden. I had a problem though. The store-room was full of old furniture, old china and various decorative objects from the previous owners who had abandoned them there when they left the business. I called the original owner's daughters and asked them if they wished to come and collect whatever was left from their father's belongings. They told me to do as I pleased with them since they had already taken all that was important a long time ago.

More than happy with their response, I disposed all that was beyond repair, stuffed the rest into another store-room and got myself busy fixing up the place. I found an iron set of shelves which I put on the wall as my bookcase, a couple of old chests where I put my personal collection of wines, a small oval table onto which I drew a white dove sitting on a branch, and used it as a desk and a very old, broken rocking-chair which I had a hard time repairing. When that was finished, I placed it by the window and, on the wall overlooking the garden, I painted a vine (clearly inspired by the aged vine in the garden). I purchased Turkish hand-made rags to put on the floor and completed the ""picture"" with an old bird cage where I put several scented candles. (I tend to use the weirdest things in the weirdest ways).

I was now admiring my ""achievement"" and wandering what was missing. Something WAS missing from that ""nostalgic touch of a long forgotten era"" I called my ""little dwelling"" at Anima. A smell! Jasmine, being my favourite flower, was soon to take its place outside the window and the picture was now completed. I'd be rocking in my rocking chair admiring the ""magic"" garden while smelling jasmine. A perfect world!

It was Saturday morning when I called the owner's oldest daughter whom I knew better than the rest of the family, and asked her to come by for a look and a cup of coffee. She kindly explained she was too busy to stay but she would gladly come with her husband to see what I'd done with the old place. Around noon, she walked through the garden and approached smiling. I was a little nervous because I hadn't told her I would be turning the store-room into my own private study but then again I didn't think she would mind.

I let them in and stood in a distance to give them space. I could hear them talk but, since it was in Turkish, I couldn't understand a word. Shortly afterwards, the husband came outside and asked me to go in and at that, I became more nervous.

Fayzan was alone inside with her back turned. I spoke gently and when she turned to face me, there were tears in her eyes. That was the first and last time she hugged me and I was deeply affected.

She responded that I had just moved her and then, again, retained her distance. She explained that she hadn't seen this room looking so beautiful and cosy since the time they lived there as a family. She said she was still a child when she would come home from school to find her dad resting in this room on his rocking chair. She had seen the rocking chair before and never bothered to take it since it was completely broken and asked me what made me want to fix it. I told her I didn't know which was true. I was quite shaken by the revelation.

""I didn't know that this was his own space, I'm sorry if I upset you"", I uttered not sure what I was apologizing for but she reassured me she was happy I fixed the room up.

She went on to tell me that the vine I so clearly loved to even draw it on the wall belonged to her father's father and had a great importance to her old man, who implored her never to let anyone cut it down. She lit up a cigarette and, after approaching the window asked me another question. What on earth made me put the jasmine by the window? I was now really shaking as I felt she had a good reason for asking and took me a while to speak. I think she must have sensed how nervous I was because she hurried to tell me it was her old man's favourite flower.

How on earth could I possibly have known that this was his rocking chair, that was his favourite flower and that he cared so much about a vine?! I supposed the rest was his stuff too but the daughter said nothing and I was not about to ask. I had enough for a day!

""The old man is a happy man now"" she added and I think I must have smiled or, at least, I hope I did.

A bit later, they were gone and I was left shaken by the ""coincidences"". I have, to this very day, never stopped wondering if all that, the decoration, the room itself, the drawing on the wall, had been my idea or someone else's dream through me. I remember feeling as if I was invading another man's space, and that now I had spent so much time fixing the room, I had no business there. The previous events concerning the mirror, and the misplaced china could not have been a coincidence, either. What if he was actually here and angry that I was touching his belongings?

I dared to stand on the front porch but I was too scared to walk any further, and just whispered ""What I did was out of love for this place, and out of respect for the beautiful objects. I couldn't let them laying there broken as they were. I didn't mean to interfere, but if my presence bothers you, let me know and I will never step foot in here again. But, please whatever the answer is, don't go moving objects or making noises because that scares the life out of me. Thank you...""

That was that. I had never, in the 3 years I stayed in that place, felt threatened, but there were instances I felt I wasn't alone. On a few occasions, I could even swear I caught a glimpse of the rocking chair slightly moving. I can't be sure it was him and yet, I know that whoever was there had come in peace to keep me company.

The Woman in my Dream,Canada,Old Hags / Night Attacks / Sleep Paralysis,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Old Hags / Night Attacks / Sleep Paralysis :: The Woman in my Dream

M y name is Mitch and I live in Montreal (Canada). I have had some experiences throughout my lifetime but the one I recall the most is... This one night I had a dream that I was on the computer, and for some strange reason I was sneaking on it and I didn't want anyone to catch me on it. So I was typing very quietly making sure nobody would hear me... All a sudden this women barged the computer room door open and scared me. Scared me so much I woke up from this ""nightmare"".

As I woke up I realized I couldn't move. My body was paralyses and it felt as if something was pressing down on me, I couldn't speak as well. The women in my dream was above me bed, smiling at me. It was extremely strange because she had terrified me in my dream, yet was so nice to me. She smiled at me for a few seconds and I got the feeling she was telling me not to be afraid... As she smiled for a few seconds she disappeared and I wasn't scared at all, which is weird because I'm a very scared person when it comes to things like that.

This happened to me in 2007 I believe but I remember it as if it was yesterday...

I'd really appreciate it if anyone can let me know if there was a message through the dream or what being paralyses like that means because it has happened to me several times, although I have only seen someone in my bedroom twice (2 different people, including the women I described).

Spirits in my Old Room,Canada,Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: Spirits in my Old Room

I 've been reading about experiences on this site for the past few days and have decided to share my own. I have an interest in the paranormal because of my family's history with it. Most of my family has had some unusual occurrence happen to them, and even where I live now there's been some pretty strange stories. The house I live in was built when I was almost a year old, and we have been the only occupants. So, as far as I see, there's no basis for any previous history to it.

When I was a kid, I was always scared of my room at night. During the hot summers, or winter nights warm from the fire, I'd stick my legs out from under the covers to cool off. Usually, without reason, I'd feel something stroking my legs, or my exposed arms. I would watch, but see nothing. I thought it was funny at the time, and told my mom. She said it was just my guardian angel.

My mom use to help me clean up my room too, and one time after cleaning it that day I was lying in bed watching my closet. The closet in that room is the type where it folds open with two panels on it. As I was watching it, it suddenly slide open about... Three or more inches. It could have been an object pushing it, but I don't remember hearing anything fall inside the closet, and even then it's not that easy to push open the closet door so it would have to have been a heavy object and I would have definitely heard that.

As I got older I moved out of the room and downstairs into the basement. I saw some things down there as well, but it felt safer than my old room. After that I moved out briefly with my mom, and we spent a few months away before moving back. I was put back into my old room. I like to listen to music in bed before I go to sleep, but I stopped for a long time after I kept seeing shadows on the ceiling that I knew/felt were not from ordinary things in my room. It scared me, so I'd just try to go straight to sleep without looking at anything at night.

During that summer I started talking to some friends late into the night, I'd often to sleep around 3 or 4 am. One night in particular I had a horrible experience. It was some time after 3 am, and I remember getting into my bed. I suddenly became unnerved by something, but I didn't know what. As the minutes went on I got more and more scared, until I was frightened beyond my wits. I did what I thought was logical at the time and hid under my blanket, trying to keep as still as possible. As I lay there, it felt like something was stroking my arm and side through the blanket. I was hearing things too, and honestly I thought it was demons talking.

I know I was wide awake, and I didn't move because I was so scared. Eventually I calmed down again, enough to work up the nerve to throw my covers open and look around. I didn't see anything, and the clock told me it was just a bit after 4 am. The voices/sounds I had been hearing were gone... But I could hear birds chirping now outside because morning had started. It's hard to explain, but sometimes I tell myself I just heard the birds chirping through that time... Yet it didn't sound like them at all!

After that I would never try to go to sleep during the hour of 3 am... I hear people say that it's some kind of bad hour, but I didn't know about that at the time and I just always kind of felt uncomfortable during that hour. I also had one night where it sounded like something was trying to open the door to my room... But it couldn't figure out how to work the knob and kept just pushing against it and fiddling around with the knob. It would happen every few minutes, and I stayed awake with my light on trying to read until it stopped.

That same summer I was talking online to a friend with my door closed during the day, alone in the house, when I suddenly heard something kick the door hard. I was puzzled... But ignored it. Then it happened again. I told my friend about it, and I got up, opened the door and looked around. I didn't see anything but I yelled for whatever it was to leave my door alone really angrily, then closed it again. The kicking stopped after that.

Since then I've moved into the basement again. Nothing strange whatsoever has happened down here so far... I just think there's something wrong with my old room. I've been told that maybe there was an incubus in my old room, but I've never had any 'sexual' attacks.

Basement of Hell,"Pennsylvania, United States",Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: Basement of Hell

I don't want to sound crazy but here we go. I am a normal kid. Nothing odd has happened to me until 3 summers ago. My house is newly built, no one died in it, nothing odd has happened in it until one night when me and my friends were having a party. My one friend said she saw something in our basement hallway, and being an idiot I went to check. I didn't see anything but it felt cold, I brushed it off (we were in a basement after all).

Soon after that, I saw shadows zooming around my basement and this started to scare me. I then went to sleep forgetting the incident.

A few months passed and nothing odd happened until one day when I had to go into the basement again but this time it was different, there was a more sinister atmosphere. Then I heard a mumble, static like something talking to me. I ran out so freaked.

Then it came up to my room and began to mess with my t.v. and my alarm clock. Turning it on and off, and then trying to talk to me again.

My one good friend says she heard someone arguing when she was watching my cat while all of my family was on vacation.

My other friend says she cannot go into my basement, that something down there scares her.

I have read about poltergeists, and how teenagers may cause them but I don't know what the things are in my house.

This has been going on for months now and it has scared many of my friends. I want to know what this is. Can anybody help me?

Haunted Clewiston Inn,"Florida, United States",Misc,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Misc :: Haunted Clewiston Inn

I live near Clewiston, a small town near Lake Okeechobee. There is an Inn there, and it's old. Supposedly, somebody died there and it's been haunted ever since. I'll try to re-tell what the lady at the front counter said to the best as I remember, because its been awhile.

There was a lady who had been in a room upstairs. Back then, they had switchboards. When it showed her room number flash, they went upstairs and found her dead, with the phone in her hand. They removed her body and re-did the room. When people weren't in the room, and the phone was disconnected, her room number would still flash on the switchboard.

There is also another room that faces the tennis courts. People say they can look up and see a woman sitting in the window. There was a fire there a long time ago.

Like I said, this is the best I can remember. There are probably a few mistakes though. I was probably 9 when I learned this.

So my sister and I wanted to see if it was actually haunted. We went upstairs and went to the room number she told us to go to. She even showed us a picture of the ghost, but my friend thinks it's fake. So we walked and I felt sort of weird. It was so quiet and creepy. Maybe I was just paranoid, but it sure didn't feel right.

When we finally found the room, it just happened to be the last room at the very end of the hallway. I don't remember why, but we got spooked and ran down stairs as fast as we could.

Creepy Stuff,"Florida, United States",Misc,"T his isn't my story, it's my sister's. Half sister. I apologize that I don't have any creepy ones like this of my own, but I can't help that. I think you'll find this entertaining anyways... My half sister lives in Gainsville. She has lived in both South Florida and North Florida throughout her life. She was a young adult around the time of this. Now she is 26.

The first story is when she was at her apartment and her friend's boyfriend came over. He asked where his girlfriend was and Jennifer (my sister) did not know. So they talked for a few until she heard a big bang. But she ignored it and continued talking. She then went back inside. She searched for the place the bang came from. She went in her room and saw something really weird. Her dresser was flat on the ground. Not only that, but all the drawers were perfectly positioned on the floor. Wouldn't the drawers have stayed INSIDE the dresser when it fell? Oh, and for the cherry on top, she didn't have carpeting or uneven floors. Pick at this one.

The 2nd story isn't as bad, and I am saving the creepiest one for last. This one involves my half brother and Jen. Courtney, my half brother, was pouring shots in shot glasses for all his friends while Jen talked to her Mom. Courtney poured one, put the drink on the counter and it shattered. He laughed it off and picked up another shot, filled it, and right when he placed it on the counter, it shattered. He was a little freaked out, picked up another shot glass, and even before the drink reached the shot glass, it shattered. 3 shot glasses in a row. Little weird, huh?

And the last and creepiest story of them all. There is nothing I can find to explain this. Jen and her guy friend were in a trailer out in the woods. Jen had a clock above her TV. She asked her guy friend to get her some water and popcorn or whatever. She looked at the clock and the hands started moving to random times. She stared at it, and the hands kept spinning around. She called her guy friend to come in the room and they were both really confused. It landed on 12. She got really scared and grabbed the clock and unplugged it, and took out all the batteries. It still changed times! She took the clock and threw it out in the woods. it's probably still there. Then her cat started pawing the air, like there was something there. He started chasing something. But there were no bugs or fluff or anything in the air. Then, she heard a creaking sound. She looked down the hall into her bedroom and saw her bed MOVING ACROSS THE FLOOR. She and her boyfriend ran out of the house, into the car, and drove to her Mom's house. She didn't go to the house for the rest of the night.

I can't answer any questions on these stories, because Jen doesn't live with me, and this is all she told me. But leave questions anyways, and I'll ask her to re-tell the story next time, and ask her the questions. Because the last time she told me this story I was about 7 or 8.

Homestead Family Hauntings,Canada,Family / Friends Visits,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Family / Friends Visits :: Homestead Family Hauntings

T he good thing about the hauntings at the farm house was that they were all passed on family members doing it. There was never a menacing or foreboding feeling when you stepped in the door and you never felt unsafe when you were alone. It's like they were watching over me and my siblings. Which leads me to my first story.

I was never a healthy child. Right from the get-go I always had respiratory problems. And being such a new baby, my crib was in my parents bedroom. One night I had stopped breathing. My parents were both in a deep sleep and probably would have slept through it, had my Nana not yelled an them to get up. (Nana had passed on some years before) She yelled, ""CHECK THE BABY!"", and my Dad is positive to this day that it was his late mother that saved my life that night. That was just one time where we experienced the paranormal.

Another time when I was three I saw an apparition of my great grandmother Sophia. I asked my daddy ""what's that old woman doing in the corner?"" I saw her over a wash tub scrubbing something, which I thought strange because she was in the living room. When I was older I found out that that part of the house I saw her in was where they did, in fact, do their laundry. I was not the only one to see her though. My big brother also saw her a short time after I did. He walked into hid bedroom and there she was sitting on his bed. Upon investigation, when we were both older we found out that that just happened to be her bedroom as well, and the room she passed away in.

We had a huge waterfront farm property. As kids we were only allowed to play in a certain part of the yard and never by the lake. One day I was playing outside and my dad was looking out the back of the house, where I wasn't allowed to play. He saw a little blonde girl who looked a lot like me, but was wearing an older style white dress. I was playing on the other side of the yard...

First Night In New Zealand,New Zealand,Apparitions / Voices / Touches,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Apparitions / Voices / Touches :: First Night In New Zealand

T his happened to me on the night of 6th of Feb., when I arrived in Auckland, New Zealand. It was a lovely day, my dad and his business partner were sitting, looking for us in the crowd. I ran to him and leaped into his arms. There was a lady standing next to him, she smiled sweetly at me, I smiled back and said ""Hello"" My dad looked at her and smiled, ""Sheni, Shy (shy is a nickname for my brother) this is my girl friend Sharnel, who I told you about..."" My face went blank, but I tried to hide it. I shook hands with her. I wasn't ready to hug her. They lived together in a 2 bedroom house in New Market. It wasn't quite big enough, so he bought a new house, in Manukau. He said we'll move in tomorrow, and for today we're sleeping over at his friend/business partner's (Andrew's) house.

We got into separate cars and drove off. We got to Andrew's house, it was quite big. It had 4 bedrooms and 2 visitors rooms. The four of us had separate rooms to sleep in, my dad and his girl friend in one room, me and my brother in 2 separate rooms. Me and my brother were upstairs. I jumped into bed after watching a movie with everyone. I dozed off, I heard my dad and his friend open the doors and climb up the stairs to watch some t.v, with the volume on low. I listened to it, and just opened my eyes, because the t.v was in the next room. I looked around the room, and there on top of the cupboard, I could see a figure, a man sitting on top of the cupboard, he looked like he was in his 40's, he was crouching down, looking at me. I felt uncomfortable, and I closed my eyes and began to pray, this is normal, because my uncle and aunt have taught me that's the first thing I should do.

The next morning as I woke up, the first thing I did was take a good look at the room, and I rubbed my eyes, washed and changed, and went down stairs. There was a corridor sort of place, full of pictures/portraits of old people. As I walked down, I saw that same man on a portrait, but about 10 years younger, I stared at it. ""That was my great grandpa"" I jumped and looked behind, a few feet away was Andrew smiling at me. ""G' Morning"" I said smiling back. He laughed politely and said, ""this house has been passed on for 6 generations"". My mouth dropped to the floor, ""wow"", I said looking at all the portraits. ""Did you sleep well?"" I smiled a bit weakly and said ""Yes, thank you"". He said ""Good, that's good..."" I stared at the picture once more and shook my head. Pretty much the end of the story. Thanks for reading! Take care and luck be with you always.

Spirit  World Makes Contact,"New York, United States",Family / Friends Visits,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Family / Friends Visits :: Spirit  World Makes Contact

W hen I was sixteen my parents were friends with a married couple about their own age, late forties. They were childless, so when the husband passed away suddenly from a heart attack, my mom invited the wife to stay at our house. Her name was Elaine. I grew up the youngest in a large dysfunctional family. My brothers and sisters were all grown and moved out so we had plenty of room. She had no family to speak of either and I'd keep her company now and then.

In the evening we'd play cards or have conversations. She knew I was sneaking cigarettes and would throw me some on the sly from time to time. That was before we knew they were so dangerous. Anyway, to make the point, we were close. In a proper way, of course. Sorry for droning but I feel the details play an important part in this, I think? She eventually moved out on her own again and I heard she passed away a few years later.

Fast-forward five years and I'm standing at my bathroom sink shaving. I'm twenty-one years old now and getting ready to go out and meet my girlfriend. Suddenly and almost involuntarily, I place my razor down on the sink. Face still covered with shaving cream I walk towards the bedroom where she, this woman Elaine had slept when she lived with us. Still not having an inkling or a remote thought of her I walked into the bedroom and am compelled say to myself ""I miss Elaine"". I've come to believe the thought was placed in my mind by telepathy. I was able to recognize it as such because I'd never experienced anything like that prior or since not to mention the last thing on my mind at the time was some woman who stayed with us five years ago and since passed away. Concurrently, as I had that thought at the ceiling on the left side of the room a blue mist with silver sparkles began to form.

I've never seen anything so beautiful. Frozen, I stood in denial as it began to expand. This was happening so fast I could hardly react. This thick smokey swirl was making intentional movements, stretching along the ceiling as it came towards me. The color was a dull pastel sky blue. The silver sparkles were bright and flashed with energy as it began to descend upon me. I didn't try to stop it, I really didn't get the chance. The smoke swirled around my head even blocking my vision. As I breathed it entered my body through my nose and mouth going deep into me. This was more like a penetration. I don't know how else to explain it. It was so warm and a feeling of love came over me. It was so pure and powerful It was exhilarating. Something not possible in the physical body. We have to feel love through a body, this was much purer. As suddenly as it began, it just ended after the love feelings. I would guess from the start of the mist forming to it dissipating was around 60 to 90 seconds.

I would like to state for the record, I was not on drugs, alcohol or anything that would impair my judgment. I'm a sixty one year old male, never been arrested or institutionalized or have I been treated for a mental disorder. And never had an experience with a mist or ghost before or since. Although I am a believer in the spirit realm since then. In the years since this event I have talked to a few psychics and mediums. They or any of the books I've researched have had an adequate explanation except she wanted to say she loved me. Duh, no kidding. I could've figured that out. Why that color. What do the sparkles mean? Why did the mist go in me. I'm not even sure it was her except that her name was placed in my head right before it happened. If anyone who reads this can share their knowledge or shed some light I would greatly appreciate your input. Sorry for the long post.

Lady in White at the Hotel Bar,"Ohio, United States",Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: Lady in White at the Hotel Bar

I was 27 in 1997 when I joined three friends -- Steve, David, and Stephanie -- on a long-weekend road trip to escape the July heat of Washington, DC. We drove west through Maryland, Pennsylvania, West Virginia, and Ohio to visit prehistoric burial mounds and sites associated with the French and Indian War. Late Saturday evening, our second day, we arrived in Marietta, Ohio. Due to a convention, the only rooms available were at the historic Lafayette Hotel -- a riverboat hotel constructed in 1918 at the confluence of the Ohio and Muskingum Rivers. With David's corporate discounts we were able to secure rooms at decent rates, and we were pleased with our great fortune to spend the night in such a grand, well-preserved, historic hotel.

Unfortunately, we arrived late enough that the hotel restaurant was no longer serving food. Our search for dining in Marietta's historic downtown proved fruitless. When my friends decided to have drinks at a saloon with overly loud country-western music, I opted out. But upon returning to my room I was restless. Unable to sleep, I dinned at the vending machine and decided on a quiet drink in the Lafayette's Riverview Lounge.

When I took a seat near the corner of the bar (with my back to the lobby entrance) it was probably 11:30 PM. Besides the bartender, the only other occupants were a middle-aged couple at a small, low table in the far corner and two hotel employees flirting over after-work drinks. With its high ceiling and massive bar, the enormity of the lounge seemed to absorb the couples' voices creating a hushed, impenetrable atmosphere. Other than the movements of the bartender cleaning up, the lounge was very still.

I drank a Jim Beam and Coke then started a second (I've since moved on to more palatable cocktails). I felt entirely relaxed and at ease. I sat -- not thinking about anything -- just appreciating my growing fatigue, the bourbon, and the beautiful atmosphere of the Lafayette. When it happened, I was neither intoxicated nor asleep and dreaming; I was in a state of complete relaxation in which my mind was not consciously focused on anything. While looking straight across the side of the bar, I noticed a pale haze moved along the left periphery of my vision.

At first, I was unable to identify or clearly discern the pale, vaporous image, but suddenly I realized this was a woman. She wore an Edwardian dress pulled tightly about her waist with either a sash or wide ribbon. Her long-sleeved dress (or skirt and blouse -- I'm not sure which) had subtle, narrow vertical design lines and a high collar. Her hair was pinned up in the style of the beautiful Gibson Girls. She and her dress were colorless, yet oddly, I thought the woman was a brunette. She was the classic ""lady in white"".

As soon as I realized it was a woman, I turned my head, but otherwise did not shift. She moved across the lounge from somewhere near the middle-aged couple. She traveled on a straight, undeviating path toward the lobby -- which brought her closer to me. As she moved, I realized she was transparent because the wall and carpet faintly showed through her skirt. But what startled me most was how she moved. She did not walk, but glided without effort. When I looked down and expected to see her shoes, she was hazy and less tangible near the floor. She did not touch the carpet as much as she seemed to hover above it.

She was fixated on the door to the lobby and never once moved her eyes or head from her goal. I did not break eye contact with her, but she seemed wholly unaware of me. She came within about 10 feet of me and was approaching the lobby threshold when she suddenly and completely vanished. At the very instant before she disappeared my reeling wits finally caught up, and my mind shouted excitedly, ""It's a ghost!"" It was at this precise moment -- the instant of my realization -- that she vanished. The entire episode probably lasted 10 seconds -- just long enough for her to cross the large room.

Immediately I looked back across the lounge hoping that someone else had witnessed this, but everyone was looking away. At first, I sat in disbelief. I tried to debunk it and contrive an explanation -- that headlights from a car glimmered on the bar mirror and my mind created this fantasy -- but as I looked out the windows and watched the mirror, I realized I could not explain away so easily what I had witnessed. I finished my drink and the bartender poured another -- my last of the evening. I asked him about the history of the Lafayette. When it opened in 1918, the Lafayette was built on the foundation and incorporated the walls of the Bellevue Hotel (1892-1916) that had been gutted by fire. When I asked about the function of the room before it became the lounge he seemed surprised that I knew the room once served a different purpose. During the 1980s the bartender said that the current lounge was created from space that he thought was originally the women's sitting room in 1918.

I did not tell my friends of the lady in white until after our trip ended -- largely for fear that they would not take my experience seriously. When I finally told Steve, we called the hotel. The manager told us of the Lafayette's unheralded reputation for the paranormal. Guests and staff often report stirrings in their peripheral vision, elevators moving without passengers late at night, strong sensations of being watched, and objects moved about rooms on the third floor. Traditionally, these events are attributed to S. Durward Hoag, a dedicated owner and tireless manager of the hotel. Obviously, it was not Hoag who I saw and unlike other accounts, my experience occurred in the lounge. From the vantage of a decade, I wish I had told my friends immediately and I wish we had stayed another night. I would love to know what important errand this lady in white was on and if anyone else has encountered her.

I am sure skeptics will scoff at my story. No one else at the bar that night can substantiate what I witnessed. Admittedly, I was tired and having a second drink on a somewhat empty stomach. And my story is not very original. Anglo-American culture is replete with tales of beautiful, tragic ladies in white. By contrast, those who believe we live in a haunted world will say that I encountered a residual haunting that replicated some moment in time. I do not know why I saw the lady in white -- only that I did. Some day, perhaps, science will explain it. In the meantime, I can only insist that I was neither drunk nor slumbering in a dreamscape. For those few fleeting seconds I was privileged to witness the inexplicable and, to this day, I cherish the experience.

It was November 7, 2007 at 1pm, I was talking to a pay phone when I noticed that I was alone in the corridor of the nursing station when I felt that it was so cold. I looked around and so shocked because I saw a thin man floating with no head. Terrified with what I saw I felt that something is not good to happened so I ran to my fiance room when I noticed that the room is full of people. The doctor talked to us and said they will leave us so we can say a last respect to him. When it was my turn he smile and say the last word to me ""I love you"" then he died while embracing him.

I have still so many experience from the time of his death. I'm going to narrate it some other time. Hope you like my story, this is my first time and maybe you can help me find a web site so I could share my love story.

The Living Room Ghost,United Kingdom,Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: The Living Room Ghost

I 'd better say this from the off - members of our family quickly get used to the weird and wonderful. We have a tendency to collect ghosts and ghost stories like they were going out of fashion. The ghost I'm about to tell you of is only the most recent, and it's one of a few that have at some point taken up residence in our house.

My mother was the first to notice that things weren't quite right in the kitchen. Most of the time it was things that could easily be attributed to forgetfulness or a coincidence. For example, a tea towel that was on the counter would be on the floor when she thought that she'd put it where it wouldn't slip; cutlery, too, would fall to the floor loudly and then vanish, only to be found a few days later somewhere that we could have sworn we'd looked before. This carried on for a while, and Mom didn't think too much of it.

Then things shifted to the living room, which is attached to the kitchen. One memorable occasion was when a whistle leapt out of a tissue box (one of those ornate and decorative wood pieces) to the floor whilst I was drying my hair there. Another, more recent one was when a small pile of coins was flicked off the TV to one side, when they had been perfectly stacked before.

A few times Mom has seen me walking in and out of the living room, as quiet as I know how to be - except that at those times I'm normally in bed, or in another room, or sometimes sitting right beside her. Even I've seen a shadow out of the corner of my eye sweeping in front of me more than once.

The ghost isn't malevolent, we think. As my uncle says: ""It's the living that hurt you, not the dead"" and so far that has proved absolutely true here. The only times I'm scared of it is when I've scared myself with wild thoughts of what it could do, but most of the time I - all of us, really - think it's just lonely or bored, and wants a little contact with others. Sometimes we talk to it, little politeness like ""good morning"" ""good night"" ""awful weather, isn't it?"" and so on to make it feel included; Dad in particular, as he's often home. It might be that this is utter nonsense and we're all mad, but I think it's nice that the ghost is there. It makes me feel safe, somehow.

Two Different Spirits in my Room,"Idaho, United States",Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: Two Different Spirits in my Room

M y husband, my two kids and I moved into this house in July of 2007. The house was built one year prior so it is pretty new. Well two weeks after living here I did my normal routine before bed. I get into bed, my husband is already asleep and about a minute after laying there I hear footsteps run past my side of the bed. I am thinking it is my 4 year old son trying to get in bed with us.

So I sit up in bed and I don't see him anywhere so I yell his name and no response. So I get up out of bed and look at the foot of the bed he is not in the room. This wakes my husband up and he says ""well go look in his room"". I got to my sons room and he is sound asleep laying and tucked in how I put him to bed 20 minutes prior.

I lay back down in bed and a few minutes later, I feel something poke at my ribs and then like someone jumping on my legs at the end of the bed. I lay up in bed again and at the end of my bed I see an outline of what was a little boy at first. Again I think it is my son so I call his name and he didn't respond, so I get up again and look at the end of the bed and no one is there. I check my son's room again and he is still asleep.

I get back into bed once again and I am laying there just kind of spooked because I have never had anything like this happen to me before. As I lay there just trying to soak it all in I realized it wasn't my son for this outline of a little boy had curly hair and my son's hair is straight and short.

So a month later, I get into bed again I am laying there and I feel the jumping on my legs again. So instead of getting up, I try and see what happens if I ignore it. For about two minutes I feel this jumping on my legs and like someone is trying to pull me out of bed. I finally look up slowly and no one and nothing is there. Still spooked but not as much as the first time it happened.

Up until last night I have had the same thing happen sometimes twice a week and I kind of just ignore it. Well last night it was different. The times before it felt playful like a child playing with me. Now last night I laid down for bed feeling just fine. All the sudden I get this rush of evil energy just rush through my body. It is a hard feeling to explain but I felt dirty and sick to my stomach at the same time like someone was in a way trying to make me feel something I didn't want to. This feeling lasted for about 5 minutes and all the sudden I heard the name ""Jefferson Lin Ames"" whispered inside my head 3 times and as it was being said, I could visually see how it was spelled. After that, the dirty evil feeling went away.

I am wondering if anyone can tell my what might be going on and how I can get this to stop. I use to just ignore it because it wasn't so evil feeling but after last night I want it to stop because I didn't like it at all.

My First Paranormal Encounter,"Michigan, United States",Family / Friends Visits,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Family / Friends Visits :: My First Paranormal Encounter

I am sure I will post more stories as time goes on, but let me start with my very first paranormal encounter. Or what I believe was my very first paranormal encounter... I can't exactly tell you the age I was. I was young. I had to still be in elementary - MAYBE early middle school because I still had my pink bedroom.

Let me describe for you the room. When you walk into the bedroom I had a antique white shelving unit that had books and my radio on it (amongst other knickknacks). The radio that I had at the time was your standard AM/FM radio with a cassette player in it. In order to turn the radio on you must push the switch over from ""Off"" to ""AM"", ""FM"", or all the way over to ""FM STEREO"". When the radio was on ""FM STEREO"" a little red dot of a light would turn on. Across from the door, adjacent to the wall with the shelving unit was my window. Opposite the shelving unit was my bed, and the dresser was on the remaining wall. At that time I did sleep with my door open, because I never had experienced anything to frighten me.

That night I was sleeping soundly and turned in my bed, waking me a little and I stared around the room. I used to like to look at what the room looks like in the dark. Suddenly my radio went on. I thought nothing of it, considering I was tired enough where my brain was not registering that someone would have to MANUALLY turn it on. I got out of bed and turned the radio off. On my way back to bed it began to register, but at the same time I though perhaps I had fallen asleep with it on.

Settling back down to go to sleep I stared at the radio - almost as if to dare it to turn back on. It did. All the way over to ""FM STEREO"". But it sounded like ""AM"" or at least it was very static and I could barely understand what was coming out of the speakers. That was enough. I knew I had a good radio station on it just a moment before - how was it not working now? All I wanted to do was run to my parents room. Only problem was I would have to run past the radio and possibly whatever had been trying to listen to some tunes.

I bolted! I was heading into my parents room and happened to glance in the dresser mirror as a giant shadow figure flew from one side of the wall to the othe r- exiting the house through the wall. I fell to the floor hoping whatever it was wouldn't find me. As I lay there on the ground next to my parent's bed I saw a card. My mother had her room clean mostly, so to find a card on the floor in an envelope was just strange. It had my name on it. It was from my deceased Grandma. After that I went to bed. Ever since I haven't been the same.

Haunted Ranch House in Shreveport,"Louisiana, United States",Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: Haunted Ranch House in Shreveport

I lived briefly in a ranch house on a 2 acre lot in Shreveport in the 1980s. The house was in a disputed estate of a man who'd shot his wife and then himself a few years before. I didn't know that at the time I moved in.

From the minute I moved in, I had a bad feeling. The very first week I was there, I went to sit in the glider swing in the backyard on a beautiful October afternoon. The day was beautiful but the backyard was not. Because nobody was looking after the house and yard (and neither me nor my roomie had the funds to spare for that), the pool was full of mud and sticks, the garden was overgrown, the grill and lawn furniture was dirty. I had an overpowering feeling of being watched, so much so that I remember looking around to see if someone was standing in another part of the yard looking at me. I finally grabbed my keys and left in my car.

I kept the keys with me constantly all the time I lived there, as that feeling would overwhelm me often. Lights flickered, floors creaked and when I was in the bath tub, I could swear I heard a man and woman arguing in the room on the other side of the tub. I found out later that was where the murder/suicide occurred.

This house had been remodeled so many times over the years that windows looked into other rooms and doors opened to brick walls, giving it an even stranger atmosphere. Since I was so creeped out by most of the house, I didn't even go into any rooms but the ones in front, my bedroom, bathroom, living room and kitchen.

One day my roommate came home and told me in a testy voice if I needed something from the garage, she should be the one to get it for me. I told her I didn't even know HOW to get into the garage, which was true. She was surprised. She told me the garage was a mess; all of my moving boxes had been pulled off the shelves and all over the floor.

She went to school and worked late nights and I worked days, so we didn't talk much, however, before she told me about the garage, I was already wondering about what was going on there. Since I could hardly sleep due to the things that went on at night, I often saw her car drive up at 3 AM, when she came home.

One night, just after she'd gone to bed, I heard her scream. I'm ashamed to say it now, but I was too afraid to get up and check on her, as I'd have to pass through the 'office' (where the crime occurred, which I didn't know about at that time). I told myself if she screamed again I'd go check on her, otherwise I'd put it down to a bad dream.

The next morning she was pretty angry at me, and asked me if I'd heard her scream. I played stupid and said 'no'. She said she had just gone to bed when she rolled over and saw a man with a horrible face bending over her. He vanished when she screamed and kicked out at him. It was then I told her that I felt the house was haunted by someone who maybe did not want me there. It was then she told me about the murder/suicide and that it had occurred in the 'office' room that you had to pass through to get to the master bedroom (her room).

We tried to get more information from her mother, who had known the family, but she was a fundamentalist Christian and got angry at us for even talking about ghosts. So we didn't discuss it much after that. However, the lights blinking and floor creaking continued, and when I'd occasionally muster up the courage to close the door to the office room (I used a broom to push it closed, I was that scared of getting too close), it would be open again when I passed by later. In addition, the hallway to that room was freezing cold, as was my bedroom. I wore gloves and a coat inside the house when I had to spend time there. It was a cold winter, that was true, but the rest of the house was never as cold as my room and the hallway.

I was alone in the house late one night and I heard keys jangling in the front door like someone was trying to get in. My roommate's dog was with me and he went nuts, running to the door and barking. I was fed up by then, so I marched to the door and flung it open and yelled 'where are you'? There was no one there. It was at least 1/8 of a mile from the porch to the road, and the driveway was in plain sight, and there was no car coming or going. Also, the yard was knee deep in leaves, so if anyone had been running through the yard, I would have heard the crunch of leaves. There was nothing, just quiet.

I called the police, who told me I was out of their jurisdiction and to call the sheriff's office, so I called them, and they told me just the opposite, so it's probably a good thing there was no one there (no one living, at least). After that, I put in for a job transfer as fast as I could and left after only four months in that house. I don't think I slept more than two hours a night the entire time I was there.

There was one more thing I always wondered about and have tried to find information about on this and other paranormal sites. After about a month after I moved there, a small red light about the size of a pencil eraser started appearing on the wall across from my bed. It would appear around 9 PM and disappear at the first light of dawn. I thought it was light reflecting from the road at first, and I tried several things with the curtains, and putting things in front of the window, but it never affected the size or intensity of the light. When I put my hand over it, it vanished, but there was also no reflection from anywhere on my hand.

After a while, it began to creep me out so I just turned away from it when it appeared. I would say it was an orb, but it never seemed to move. If anyone has ever experienced or heard of what this is, I would appreciate knowing about it. Thanks.

Shocked To Bits,Sri Lanka,Apparitions / Voices / Touches,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Apparitions / Voices / Touches :: Shocked To Bits

F irst of all, before I start my story, I want to give a little introduction about me. Most of you may know that I have experienced a lot the past 2 years, my past experiences are all those that I have posted earlier on here. My name's Shenara to start with, and I turned 14 on the 30th of December '07. I migrated to New Zealand on the 6th of feb, for 2 reasons, #1, because my father lives here, and second, because of the situation in Sri Lanka, war is breaking out. Now onto the story (this happened while I was in Sri Lanka).

It was just me, my uncle and cousins. We were on our way home after a party. I was to sleep over at their house that night. So we got down. And he got a call. He cut the line and said ""Okay you all, I just got a call from the police department and they need to see me, and I'm sure you guys are too tired to come with me, there's somebody gone missing, so I'll see you tomorrow or so"". We smiled half asleep and said ""we want to come!"". He laughed and said ""hop in then"" we laughed, and jumped in. My uncle has this habit of having the radio on really loud. And maybe it was to keep him awake. It was around 3 in the morning I assume. After 10 minutes, we all fell asleep.

As he was driving, he could see a lady in a white night gown, walking along the road, and he realized that was odd, so he drove close to her, and opened the door, offering her a lift. (this part where he was driving had no houses, just fields). She smiled and got in, she looked like she was in her late 20's. Really fair, and brown eyes. As she got into the car, the radio went blank, it made a weird shhh noise, like when you're trying to tune the radio. He groaned and switched off the radio. So he asked ""where about do you live?"" He had his eyes glued to the road. After a few minutes, no answer, so he looked at the front seat, and nobody was there. He shook his head and turned his head back towards the road and hit the breaks. We all woke up wondering what happened, and what the five of us saw, made me and the 3 of my cousins scream. There was a lady floating in thin air, in a sleeping position (like lying down on a bed). Her face had a blank expression, but her eyes spoke a thousand words. Her eyes were looking right at me, she tilted her head up, as if she wanted to take a good look at me she smiled in a way I felt very uncomfortable in. Instantly we all closed our eyes and held hands and started to pray as hard as we could. Finally after about 15 minutes of praying, we all opened our eyes, and there was nothing.

We all looked at each other in relief. And finally we got to the cop shed, all of us wide awake and alert. The cops looked the same. We all sat around a glass table talking about the missing person. It was a girl, 28, Sujatha Ananda (a typical native name). She had gone missing last night. We looked at each other, a bit uncomfortable. Mr Wright, one of the cops, we call him Chingy. We know most of the cops really well. Chingy said ""what?"" My uncle sighed. He's known best for finding missing persons and ghost hunts as I like to call it. ""I saw a girl walking down Evergreen park..."" (he explained what happened). And they just looked at us in a concerned look. I had goose bumps all over me. We all got up, and decided we need to find the body. And since she was in a night gown, we decided to trace where she might have walked from her house, to Evergreen Park.

We got into the cop cars, I adore getting in one of them. And we set off to her house, then from there, the 3 cop cars decided which roads to take, we got back in the cars and began to search for her. The 3 of us in the back held torches on each side of the road, looking for signs of life. Finally we came to a building, in the middle on plain grass and tees, which was built by some university students for a project 30 years ago, now abandoned. We heard one of the windows banging, it was a 5 story building, and the on the fifth floor, a window was open and banging, we walked around the building, our hearts beating fast, and on the other side, we found the body, we covered our noses, and I just stared at the pool of blood. She had committed suicide. She died smiling, which was scary, Chingy put on a glove, and closed her eyes with his 2 fingers. We looked at my uncle a bit upset, we all held hands and prayed over her. Chingy took out his cell phone and took a call. He put his phone in his pocket and said ""the p.d will send someone to get the body..."" After about half an hour, they finally arrived, and took the body away. That was quite an experience, I hope you all liked my story. Feel free to comment. Thanks for reading! Take care and good luck always.

Did I Really See Something?,"New Jersey, United States",Apparitions / Voices / Touches,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Apparitions / Voices / Touches :: Did I Really See Something?

F or years this experience has puzzled me. Either it was real, or it was the most realistic dream I have ever had. I was in my early 20s, still living at home with my parents. The room in which this experience took place had been my bedroom for most of my life. Nothing unusual had ever happened in the house (except for a few incidents involving a supposedly ""haunted"" antique clock in our living room which was broken, strictly ornamental, but insisted on chiming once in a while for no reason). At the time my parents were in a crisis that ultimately ended in their getting divorced. I was, as could be expected, very concerned about what was happening in the family.

The night in question I was in bed asleep, but for the life of me I would swear I woke up, opened my eyes, and beheld a figure standing by the closed door to my room. It was a tall, androgynous figure draped in robes, raising its left arm above its head. What's more, it was giving off its own light in the otherwise darkened room -- but only enough to light the area immediately around it, not the whole room. I sat up in bed and addressed the figure, reaching as I did for the lamp on the nightstand next to my bed. I turned on the light. The next thing I knew I was sitting up in bed with the light on, and the figure was gone.

I have told this story to a lot of people, many of whom believe I actually saw something, but others pooh-pooh it as a fantastic dream. In my heart I believe I might have actually seen a Guardian Angel who came to comfort me in my troubles. I don't really know. What do you people think... ?

The White Crocodile God,South Africa,Misc,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Misc :: The White Crocodile God

I live with my father and brother in Johannesburg South Africa ""and no there are no lions or antelope running around in the streets it's a city just the same as any other in the US"". Well I'm 19 years of age now and a geography student at the University of Johannesburg UJ. I'm a white young male but here in Africa we work together with the native people. Thus I see myself as a meticulous person and scientifically correct.

This occurrence happened during the autumn in April southern hemisphere when we were on a vacation to the northeastern part of the country to Venda land. This is an area where the Venda people have established themselves in a lush vegetated area of the country where there is a small rainforest and a swamis' area. This is situated right next to the Kruger National Park I think everybody is familiar with it and thus its still a very primitive place with lions, crocodiles, antelope and hundreds of other species of animals.

Now I was 17 at the time and almost done with school, this vacation was just what I needed. So we headed towards the Kruger National Park and stayed there for a week's time in the Punda-Maria camp the most northern camp in the park. Having seen Nyala, Giraffe, Hippo, Leopard etc we became bored with the area and decided to travel to Thohoyandou one morning, this is the capital of the Venda land. Now just so you know these people that stay there have been modernized but still have kept to some African traditions, the one that they are renown for is the fact that they believe in a white crocodile, this is their ""god"", and I'm sure there have been rumors in the US about this but its true they do worship the crocodile because they have done so since before Rome was built. Imagine yourself having to find your only food source which is fish and have no knowledge at all about the outside world. Then a creature that the ""king of beasts"" the mighty lion even fears appear from nowhere and strikes with such force that it can kill a full grown buffalo, it takes about 4 lionesses to stand a chance against a buffalo. So that's what these people think, its invincible and yet endangered.

So I at the time wanted to see this creature for myself, because every body here talks bout the white crocodile that has been around forever. Now just so you know the crocodiles that you see on television is mostly your American alligators, I have been to Florida in 2000 (and yes were on an airboat ride at the everglades) and the Australians so called salties Steven Irwin. Now the alligators are just plane boring and the Australians are always going on about stuff, the largest salty ever caught wasn't even 4.5 metres, now that's large considering its the length of 3-4 persons. Well here in Africa there is the Nile crocodile, the largest carnivore on land, measuring up to 4 metres and the largest ever was close to 6m, that's almost 20feet.

So we went to the place in Venda and weren't allowed to go into the forest there because only the priests are. For decades young girls of the tribes was sacrificed to this crocodile that inhabits the lake, because it will cause some sort of illness if they don't. So the legend goes that the girls are sent into the lake walking all dressed up with a weaved basket on their head full of Impala meat, then she just disappears below the water and all that you see is the water turning red in the full moon.

So my father made a plan and we decided to wander into the forest that night because everybody is asleep, afraid of the mosquitoes that carry the malaria disease. We got a native to be our guide, his name was Elias, but they call him whitey because he speaks the language of the white man.

That night I will never forget, I don't think it was a ghost, it couldn't be because I don't really believe in such things although the natives do. We went into the forest of Venda meaning nice place of rest. You walk past a lot of cycads and thorn bushes then there is a stage where the bush is just so lush. We eventually made it to the lake at around 22:30pm and sat there on the shore taking a rest. My brother who is now 16 had one of those large 3000,000 candle powered lights with him and shined over the water, to my amazement there were no red little lights which would normally be crocodile eyes shining red in light at night. The Kruger Park is not far from there and crocs are most common in the rivers.

Then the guide Whitey decided to head back because it was closing in on midnight and the moon was going under meaning that it was soon to be so dark that you can't see anything. So we stood up and my brother threw a piece of meat we brought along now covered in mosquitoes into the lake, it was then that I didn't want to leave because there came a huge hissing blowing, soon meaning there was a crocodile near the shore.

Whitey decided to wait for us up in a tree being afraid, now they say white men are ignorant and not respective of nature well that was turning out to be true. What I saw wasn't a ghost it was a real life creature and it wasn't white more grayish. It lifted its head out of the water and then made that sound again bellowing like crazy. It looked like a crocs head but wasn't as flat. The 3 of us ran for it up into the same tree as whitey and sat there staring at it. It came out of the water and then I realized that it wasn't any crocodile but a whitish dinosaur, no really!

The stuff they teach us say they extinct 65 million years ago but here was a large carnivorous looking beast, it didn't leave the lake which is very large it just stood in the shallow water and looked over the lake. It stood on two legs and had a long tail and two small forearms, wasn't the trex form Jurassic park though, it had scales and wasn't as large. My father recon it stood about 2m tall and was like 5meters in length.

I saw it for maybe 20min and then it went under again. Now why would this be in a swamp eating fish and girls and not extinct in some sort of mudstone layer in Northern America.

I ran that night away like I never ran when it went under followed by my father and brother, I swear this is true I can still see it at night in my dreams, but I never told nobody because its against the theory of evolution and scientists which I associate myself with to some degree.

Best of luck to all and thanks for the opportunity that I have to share this with you.

The Henderson House and Kitty Phantoms,"North Carolina, United States",Pets / Animals,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Pets / Animals :: The Henderson House and Kitty Phantoms

A fter events in my previous story, "" Strange Things Happened in That House "" things were pretty quiet for a while, having moved to a few different locations in Pennsylvania. There was one instance of being at my parents' friends' house and chasing the smell of perfume around the room, but nothing else eventful for three or four years.

The day came when my family moved to Henderson, North Carolina, and boy was that a culture shock! None the less, it was a good neighborhood with lots of friendly kids who came to play with my sister and me, as soon as word got out we were there.

A few weeks passed when my dad's temper seemed to rise to a peak and boil over. He had always been short tempered and quick with a curse word or two, but this was complete madness, almost as if he were possessed, which I believe he might have been after what I experienced.

I was about ten or eleven years old when I started having dreams about the small creek and woods in our back yard. I was always looking for something that was just beyond my vision. Then I dreamt of digging bones up in the back yard. My sister and I tried upon waking, but of course we got in a bit of trouble with mom, and I couldn't dig beyond about a foot in that thick red clay anyway.

Then came the episodes of blacking out while writing or doing homework. I would kind of come to and there would be a page full of curse words and black scribbles, and I didn't remember doing it. It would really tick me off sometimes as I would do it right over my homework.

One day, I felt the funny feeling I would get before one of these episodes, and I fought it. I couldn't stop it, but it was like I was watching myself and felt pure evil emanating in the room. I would have high tailed it out of there if I could have.

One time, after we had gotten a cat, it happened while she was in the room with me, and she scratched me in the face. I did other things in this evil state, but they are too embarrassing to list. Lets just say, I know I was possessed.

We all really hated living in that house, besides having good neighborhood friends. Mom even made the comment a few times that there was something evil there. So, we moved to another haunted location fifteen minutes south in a small town called Oxford. But that move and the experiences in that house will have to wait for a later date as it is a large portion of my life, and thus a long tale.

Skipping ahead to this past February, for my second experience, I had some strange and one sad experience. I live with my boyfriend in an old apartment house, also haunted. It was the week of Valentines Day, and I kept thinking I saw a few of my cats that have passed since living here. Out of the corner of my eye I would see Lynk, a very light colored tabby, slinking around. Lynk passed from feline leukemia in 2006.

One day I walked into my kitchen an there on my stove for a split second was Metallica, my old black cat, who was hit by a car in 2002. Every day up until Valentines Day, I saw these two slinking around my house. Sometimes I would feel a cat rub my leg, and see one of them for a split second, and poof they were gone!

There was even one night when all three of my living cats were outside, and I felt the presence of Keedon curl up between me and Jeff as she used to do when she lived with us. This happens from time to time. Keedon I raised from bottle as her mother died delivering, and I gave her to my parents in 2001, as they spoiled her on canned fish. A much better kitty life than I could afford. Keedon was very sick and put to sleep last year. Feline leukemia strikes again, and she was even vaccinated for it.

Well, Valentines Day comes, and something feels off all day. I am out to a maternity appointment, then shopping, and getting prescriptions, just totally busy all day. When finally I am done, I am driving my mother's car back to her and for some strange reason blurt out to myself, ""No dead kitties today!"" I thought ""That's weird. Why would I just say that?"" It was like tourettes or something.

So I returned my mom's car and my little brother took me home helping me with my parcels. He left to go home, and I began making a nice Valentines' dinner for my Jeffery. Well I had just barely gotten the groceries away and the chicken in the roaster when my little brother came running back into the kitchen.

""Um Steph, are all your cats in the house?"" he asked very concerned. My heart sank. I had only seen Mr Pooh and Puck. I ran to the back door and called out for Muffin and she never came. She always came to my calling. I knew then and cursed out loud.

My little brother Eric tried to reassure me by saying that the cat in the road looked too big to be Muffin, but I knew it was her. I gave him a hug and he left. I finished getting my bird into the oven, and tried calling Muffin again.

I swallowed the lump in my throat, and went to where he said he saw her. Sure enough it was Miss Muffin. Thank God, it appeared other drivers avoided her body as she was very clean. She took a good blow to the head, but wasn't gross or anything. I stood there for a minute in the middle of the road in shock. Then I realized, people drive on roads and I should move! I pulled her out of the road and speed walked back home bawling. (My animals are like people and family! Plus I am pregnant and everything makes me cry right now!)

I cried well after Jeff got home. At one point my mother came bursting through the door knowing what had happened, and worried I was alone. Her and Jeff put Muffin in a nice box.

We buried her that night in my parents' yard next to the flowery bush near Keedon's grave. Muffin's son Gage witnessed the burial from afar. My mom said maybe it was coincidence, but she told Gage his mother had died and a little tear ran down his kitty nose.

I know she died an instant death and felt no pain. I also think it was something unavoidable considering the phantom kitties that roamed my house before hand. It was as if they showed up to take her, or maybe even let me know it would be alright.

Stranger still, I had a dream that my deceased PapPap (grandpa) came to see how I was faring, and Miss Muffin was with him.

Well that's all I have for tonight kiddies. I will be back with many more tales some other time. I hope y'all enjoyed, and thanks for reading.

Some More Disturbing Encounters at Anima,Greece,Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: Some More Disturbing Encounters at Anima

T his is an account of the events that were related to me by our student and waitress at Anima. I have already mentioned in my previous story, The Mirror at Anima , that Elisabeth (one of the bartenders) had claimed to have felt a presence passing almost through her at some point, as well as heard glass breaking, and I was soon to discover that there was a broken mirror and what looked like broken glass in the kitchen when nobody had touched either. Elisabeth had finally admitted that she was too scared to keep working on weekdays and preferred to work on Fridays and Saturdays when the rest of the staff were there. She would be working as a waitress since John was our weekend bartender. We agreed and all was well for a while.

She later went on to tell me that even during our busy nights, she would still feel something passing right by her and that the speed with which it passed was so fast, that on some occasions, it would knock off things right next to her or that she would feel as if a gust of cold wind had hit her. I asked her how come she didn't tell me right away or how come she was able to remain calm and continue serving drinks, to which she admitted to having confessed everything to the bartender who promised he would be watching out for her. She also told me she was afraid we wouldn't believe her as the experiences were pretty intense and felt very uncomfortable because my husband was not only her employer but also her college professor. I was a little disappointed she chose not to trust me but I said nothing further.

Another time, after finishing work on a Saturday night, she went on to have a few drinks at another bar but at around 4am, she realized she had forgotten her cell phone at our bar. She asked her friend to drive her back so she could retrieve it and, when she entered through the main door, she found all the table napkins scattered all over the place. She knew and I knew that the bar had been cleaned before we left that night and, since there were no windows open, there was no logical explanation for what she was seeing. Needless to say, she had told that one event to my husband who refused to allow any space for any kind of supernatural explanation and tried to rationalize it. That provided the clue as to why she chose not to speak to us about it again, I suppose.

And yet, one other account she related to me was even more disturbing especially because that particular time I was at the inner bar talking with a friend and I didn't have a clue about what went on ""back stage"". I remembered right away that I had seen the cook coming out of the kitchen (which is right next to the bathroom door), and, after entering the bathroom for a few moments, she came out to whisper something to the bartender. I asked if there was something wrong but when I saw that neither of them was eager to provide explanations, I let it go for the time being as I didn't want to stir up things in front of our guests.

Elisabeth told me that she was in the bathroom when she heard someone knocking on her door. She thought it must have been a customer and answered ""occupied"" only to make whoever was out there angry as ""he"" was now knocking so hard, she thought the door would crumble down. She said she had yelled once trying desperately to remain in control of herself and, at that, she heard the entrance door open (that was the cook) who had heard her yelling as well as the banging on the door. Unfortunately, none of us heard anything since there was loud music playing. The cook could not, though, open the door which seemed jammed somehow, and it was then when she called the bartender. The explanation I was given that night was that Elisabeth could not open the door and ""she kind of freaked out"". In addition, when I later asked her why she thought it was a ""he"" banging on the door, she told me she could hear him breathe and it sounded like it had been a man.

Even worse, some time after that event, and during a very busy night, John (the bartender) asked Elisabeth to go outside in the garden and fetch him more ice from the outdoor freezer. (Now that, to me at least, sounded like he had not believed the paranormal nature of her previous account as he wouldn't have asked her to go out alone in the garden to bring him anything). Elisabeth initially refused but since John was too busy to do it himself, she finally agreed, reluctantly.

Now, just to give you a picture of what the garden looked like at night, I would tell you, it wasn't dark. It never was dark because I would always insist that they keep all the lights on but turn the dimmer low to make the garden look more romantic. Therefore, once inside, you could see the whole garden, and when outside, you wouldn't stumble onto something. So, Elisabeth walks outside, goes to the freezer fills the cooler with ice but when she turns around to come inside, she spots somebody looking at her from inside MY STUDY! (I had the lights on in there too-dimmer at low). She told me it seemed as if it was a man, not tall but of medium height. No features could be detected since she fled the scene. I was again not informed immediately but then I have to wonder. Would have I gone to check it out? Probably no, would have I asked anyone else to do it for me? No!

Then we come to Elisabeth's last night at the bar, as she quit the next day. It's early in the evening when the first quests arrive, wishing to try our middle-eastern dishes. John is again inside the bar. Elisabeth takes the order and rushes inside the kitchen to inform our cook. She forgets to write the number of the people sitting at the table and, just goes back outside to serve them the wine they had ordered. Our cook without asking her to specify, comes out of the kitchen, counts the dinner guests and, places the appropriate number of cutlery and dishes on her tray.

Some time after that, and as soon as the first dishes were ready, she calls back the waitress to serve them on the table. Elisabeth soon goes back returning what she called ""the extra dish and cutlery"" to the cook who was puzzled at first since she was sure she had counted 5 and not 4 people. Elisabeth insists and finally the cook presumes that the 5th person must have left. The girl at first (as she told me) was not sure what to make of it, we all make mistakes but, having experienced what she had until that moment, she rushed back into the kitchen to inquire further. Now, our cook didn't believe in spirits or the paranormal or so she claims, and Elisabeth told me that every time she would go to her for comfort, the cook would try to ""bring her back to her senses"", but that evening, as soon as she returned to the kitchen, the cook's face was rather pale.

After her persistent questioning, the cook admitted to have been certain that she had seen 5 people at the table. El went back outside to ask the bartender if he had seen anyone leaving while she was in the kitchen, and John had said no. Needless to say, when I asked her if she could describe the person the cook had seen, she told me it was an elder man who was sitting at the end of the table, two seats away from the rest. I later double checked it with our cook but to my surprise, she had now changed her mind and wasn't sure whether she had actually seen him. The bartender claimed he wasn't paying attention to the door so, anyone could have left without being seen (he was busy preparing the tray, he told me.)

Finally, that same night Elisabeth, unwilling to sleep alone at her apartment, takes up the cook's offer and sleep at her place. When the bar closed and we all left (a bit earlier than usual), Elisabeth stayed behind with our cook to help her with the next day's preparations (we had a large number of guests coming in for some kind of celebration).

In the meantime, the cleaning lady was cleaning the rest of the bar. She was the first to finish and the cook told her to leave as she would lock up for the night. As they were locking up a few minutes afterwards, and got in their car, the cook received a call from the cleaning lady telling her that she had forgotten to take out the garbage. Elisabeth was asked to go fetch it as the cook was behind the wheel and the bag was left right behind the door two feet from the street. The poor girl had obviously felt it was inappropriate to insist that her elder friend go instead of her, and reluctantly set off.

She said that when she opened the side door, she found the plastic bag ""carefully opened"" not torn, and half the garbage scattered around it as if somebody had been looking for something. She told me that the cleaning lady had sworn that she had tied the bag well and that nobody had any access to the bar since all the doors were locked behind us when we left.

After El had quit, I approached both John and the cook and inquired further into El's accounts. John admitted to have felt strange sometimes but then he thought it was because of El's allegations, and that a few of the ""accidents"" like the knocking off of various objects and such, were a bit too coincidental but he wasn't convinced there was something there. He quit shortly afterwards.

As for my good friend the cook, she told me that she had, indeed, heard the noises from the bathroom that night and she had, at times, found my study room door open when she had previously locked it. But, of course, it couldn't possibly be a ghost! Now, the bathroom incident could easily be explained provided that one wasn't present when the knocking on the door was taking place. I mean, one can simply suggest that El was in panic and wasn't aware that she was the one banging on the door. One can also believe that a closed door can open on its own without the interference of a ghost but, a LOCKED door?

All of the Lights Were Off,"Massachusetts, United States",Poltergeists / Physical Manifestations,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Poltergeists / Physical Manifestations :: All of the Lights Were Off

O ne day I was getting up for school. I had to wake my sister up. So she got up. Me and she sat down to talk. She ate breakfast then she told me that she had to leave so I said ok. When she left nobody was home except for me. My mom was at work so was my dad. My brother has been gone the whole week and was not coming back yet. Besides the door was locked after my sister left. So nobody could get in.

All of the lights in my house were on. When I went to the bathroom they were still on. I was in there for about 10 minutes. I came out and all of the lights were off. Nobody was home to do that. So I purposely turned on the lights and went back in to the bathroom for about 10 minutes. I came back out and the lights were off. I was really scared at that point. I sat down to think. I thought maybe my dad came home and used his key to get in. So I called my mom. Told her what was going on. She called my dad's work and he said he never came home. So I was freaking out by that point. I did it one more time and the lights were off again.

So I sat down and played the game system to forget about what was going on. I was so scared I did not even leave my living room. A few minutes later a lock that was on my shelf in the kitchen came flying in to the living room and hit my game system so hard it moved it.

Finally my mom was done with work and I told her what happened. I was so scared I could barely talk.

A Quiet Suburban Haunting,United Kingdom,Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: A Quiet Suburban Haunting

T his is my first posting, and is likely to be one of my last. I'm not a magnet for the bizarre, the incidents I experienced are slight, and lastly they occurred in a property that I no longer spend much time visiting. Thrill-seekers may be disappointed here; as I offer no stories of jumping beds, headless horsemen, or dire warnings from disembodied voices; just the simple tale of a suburban haunting.

When I was eight years old my grandfather re-married and relocated to Coventry from his home in Portsmouth to be with his new bride. My father, not wanting to see the home he had grown up in being lost to someone outside of the family, bought the house from his father and moved back to his childhood home with his family, consisting of myself, and of course my mother and father.

I always felt uneasy within the house (feeling watched etc) but despite having a firm interest in ghosts from a very young age I always chalked this up to imagination.

The uneasy feeling got worse as I got older, and by the time I was in my teens it had intensified, centered almost solely on the bathroom. The feeling of panic was so intense that I was often too terrified to put my head under the water. I frequently had dreams about being held in the water by the hair on the back of my head and would wake up struggling to breathe.

Gurgling and splashing was often heard at night, along with rappings and shuffling sounds, and lights would switch on and off at their own accord.

My parents arrived at the conclusion that it was the central-heating boiler, or the mains fuse, or what ever was convenient enough to shoulder the blame, but then something happened that they could not explain.

I was sixteen at the time, and one morning my parents took a trip to visit my grandfather in Coventry. They left before I woke up, and had told me the night before departing that they would not be back until the next day (owing to the long drive).

I was woken by the postman knocking at the door so after answering the door to him, I shut the door and bolted it; as was my habit. With the front door bolted there was no exterior access to the house, as my parents (worried about my absent mind) would keep all of the windows and the back door locked from the inside so that I would not leave them open if I left the house.

I retired to my room for the rest of the day, as at the time I was studying for exams. I fell asleep at my desk in the early hours of the morning.

My parents roused me a few hours later by banging on the front door, I had left the bolt on and they were unable to get in, regardless of their possession of a key. I stumbled down the stairs in a half awake state and opened the door to my furious father pointing at the driveway. As the door opened and he glanced at the hallway he became even further incensed and started shouting. I rubbed my eyes sleepily and looked at what he was pointing at.

Two sets of footprints bleached into the carpet leading from our bathroom, down the stairs, and through the front door, before fading out at the end of our driveway. One of the sets of footprints were quite small bare feet, and the others were large, and clearly made by a man's shoe.

My father eventually believed that it was nothing to do with me, and the initial suspicion fell upon burglars who had been disturbed by me and fled without taking anything, but I was skeptical of this, as there had been no way of accessing the inside of the house.

After this event there was no more activity, I moved out of my parent's house, and I thought it was finished with. That is until an unexpected footnote just a year ago.

I was talking to one of the ladies who lives on my parent's road, an elderly lady who had been one of the very first people to live on my street.

We got chatting about the house my parents occupied, and I jokingly told her about the odd events and the footprints. Her face grew grim.

She told me that the first people to occupy the house had been just before my grandfather had moved in. They had been a middle-aged couple who behind a screen of social niceties were said to live a terrible existence. The husband had been an alcoholic, who didn't think twice about raising a hand to his wife. My neighbour told me of many occasions where the poor woman would have bruises on her face and arms.

Apparently the violence culminated one night when the husband returned from a bar and found his wife washing her hair in the bath. He had consumed much more drink than was his usual tipple, and had been thrown out of the establishment for being aggressive to the staff. Another neighbour who had seen him walking home had said that he was in a terrible rage.

He walked into the bathroom, and forced his wife's head under the water in a drunken assault. She struggled and managed to run from the bathroom and out of the front door, but he caught up with her at the end of the driveway and beat her to death. He then reported the crime to the police and apparently later hung himself in prison.

Are the footprints in the hallway spirits retracing their steps?

Either way, I don't like to go back there; I make my parents visit me now!

I would like to thank everyone who reads this story, and apologize that it is slow-moving and badly-written. I would be very interested in hearing your theories!

Holiday Season Experience,"Nebraska, United States",Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: Holiday Season Experience

I t was freezing outside, Christmas just around the corner. We had just celebrated Thanksgiving; I can not say I was happy about the holidays. My parents had recently separated, my mom, sister and I moved into one of the many apartments we would inhabit for the next few years, and life felt to be at a very low point for me at the time.

I was almost home. My hands were so cold they ached, as well as my feet and my nose. My sister was trudging through the falling snow behind me, whining that she was cold. I took the key out of my pocket to unlock the door and dropped it! There was at least a half foot of snow and I had dropped the key! You would think a big silver key ring shaped like a shoe with a gold key would be easy to spot in the white snow, it seemed to have disappeared. My sister and I searched frantically for the key. Finally after about fifteen minutes, we found it, right where I dropped it.

We proceeded up to the house split into three apartments. We had the main floor apartment, a young couple was in the second floor and a single man who was rarely there had the top floor. As we approached the side of the house on to the walk leading to the front door, the curtains moved aside about eight inches. There was an older, time worn hand pushing the curtains aside. I looked up and there was a face, about what would be approximately seven feet off the floor in the apartment. She appeared to be time worn as well, very aged. She had steel gray hair, and bright blue eyes. As she smiled, I noticed all of her teeth were pointed! I had never seen this face before; I would have remembered those eyes and teeth.

I stopped walking, staring at the window. The face stared right back. I realized my sister was clinging to my arms from behind, she was breathing very heavily as if ready to break into a sob. She said ""Kim, do you see that lady in the window? Who is it?"" I told her I did see the lady and I did not know who it was, but we would go to the house and find out. She screamed and pulled on me begging me not to go to the door. My mom wasn't due home for at least another two and a half hours, so what were we supposed to do? Stay outside and freeze? I was not going to the neighbors, I did not know any of them in the building, and this house was positioned so there were no houses on either side or behind for at least the equivalent of half a city block, as I mentioned we moved a lot so, I did not know anyone.

I told my sister (four years younger than I) to wait near the street for me to go in the house. If I did not come back out or call for her to come in, she would need to run the half block to the neighbors to get help. (Remember, this was before cell phones). She grudgingly agreed. I sure sounded a lot braver than I felt.

As I got around to the front door, I wondered if the face was still in the side window. I peaked around the side of the house to the window and saw only the curtains swaying pretty rapidly. I put my key in the door, turned and pushed. The door would not open! I pushed again, nothing. I then started to get angry, I started praying that my sister and I would be able to get in and get warm, that who ever was messing with us would knock it off for now so we could be warm. I pushed again on the door, it finally opened. Whew!

The room was dark, the only light coming in from the swaying curtains and from the Christmas tree. I reached out to turn on the light switch and felt something cold and tingling grab my hand! It felt like cold tree branches wrapping around my hand. I jerked my hand back, shook it and kept praying in my head. I reached out again and turned on the light. I saw nothing. Everything appeared as it did before leaving that morning, except the three foot Christmas tree we had up on a table had fallen over and the lights were on the tree turned on. I know I had unplugged it because of the fire hazard. Oh, well. I walked through the apartment, not to hard as this was a very small place and saw and felt nothing so went out to get my sister.

As my sister came in the house, I closed and locked the door. We began to get all of our outer winter gear off, the Christmas lights on the tree keep turning on and off. I checked the cord and the fuse, all seemed okay so I unplugged them to be safe. Well, that didn't stop them from turning on and off. I distracted my sister from the lights by offering to make a snack. We went into the kitchen, as we entered the kitchen the back door flew open along with the back screen door. All the wind and snow blowing in all over. Remember, I had just checked this door in my walk through and it was dead bolted. We did not even have the dead bolt key to lock or unlock this door and it was the type that required a key on both sides.

I ran to the door to close the weather out and saw the weathered old woman kind of drifting across the back lot with her face to me, drifting backwards. The odd grin with her pointed teeth never changed nor did the piercing stare of the cold blue eyes, then she vanished about thirty feet from the door.

This is one exert from our time in just that tiny apartment we only inhabited for eight months. I will share more if anyone is interested. If this one is to boring so far, let me know and I will not continue on.

Thank you as always for the support on this site! You are all the best!

Strange Things Happening,United Kingdom,Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: Strange Things Happening

I 'm trying to find out if I'm going mad or these things really happen. So here are a few experiences that have happened recently and one that happened a while back.

When I first meet my partner about 6 years ago I was at his place, he had gone to work and I was at home at around lunch time. I heard a noise and thought he was coming back so I turned the TV off, lay in bed pretending to be sleeping. I heard footsteps coming up the stairs and felt someone sitting next to me, thinking it was him, about 10 seconds later I turned around and said ""ha tricked you I'm not sleeping!"" only to find there was no one sitting next to me. So when he come home I mentioned it to him and he said that was weird, I was imagining things, only a while later he told me that now and again he used to wake up in the middle of the night and felt like someone was holding him down and he could not move.

Now a few weeks ago in the same flat I feel asleep on the sofa and the TV and lights were off, when I woke up the lights were on. Friday night again I was watching tv with the lights on when I woke up in the middle of the night the tv had been switched off now. I was at home on my own, my daughter was asleep in the next room, so who turned the tv off?

Last week my daughter woke up in the morning and asked ""someone said hey to me"" and she asked if it was me.

So I'm not sure what to make of these things but they are happening, am I just been paranoid any comments will help.

Haunted by a Water Spirit,Macao,Misc,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Misc :: Haunted by a Water Spirit

I moved to Macao about 1 year ago for work and I have been renting an old 2 bedroom flat by myself. A few weeks later I found a flatmate who sleeps in a bedroom next door. One morning my flatmate commented on screams and unintelligible spoken sounds coming from my room and asked if I had a bad dream. I had no recollection of any dream and I was aware that I sometimes speak out loud when I dream so I took no notice of it.

A few weeks later my flatmate made another comment about the noises, I thought nothing of it but then he told me it happens on a regular basis. I told him to wake me up next time, so I can recall what I was dreaming about.

It wasn't long when I had another night of noisy sleep, my flatmate came into my room and woke me up. When I was awake I was wet with cold sweat, and the bed mattress was hanging half off the bed. My flatmate told me I was moving violently in my sleep and we thought that's what caused the mattress to come off the bed. We turned on the lights to put the mattress back and noticed that there was a bit of water under the mattress. We lifted up the mattress and the wooden support beams that hold up the mattress were soaked. As if someone had poured a glass of water onto them.

My flatmate moved out of the house a few weeks later, and I have been living alone in the house since for about 6 months. I regularly lift up the mattress in the mornings to check it and the phenomena reoccurs on a regular basis. Each time it does I will leave the mattress off the bed, dry the bed and go to work. When I am back from work the bed is completely dry, however the water re-appears the next morning.

I have lived in Hong Kong and I have witnessed condensation appearing on walls etc on humid days but this is totally different to that. For one the water only and always appears under the mattress, and not on any other furniture. Also it occurs regardless of the weather and climate. I don't spend a lot of time in the house so I can't say I feel the house is haunted, also I have changed the locks since my old flatmate moved out so I can rule out anyone entering the house when I am not in.

What should I do, should I be worried or am I in any danger? My health is good in general, and I have no recollection of bad or good dreams. One friend who heard the story said it could be a water spirit/demon and warned me not to go swimming. I never learned to swim anyway so I don't go to pools or beaches.

Cursed Family,"Iowa, United States",A Haunted Life,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: A Haunted Life :: Cursed Family

F irst of all my girlfriend and I moved into this house about 4 months ago. It is a old house built in about 1915! When we first got here everything seemed nice and pleasant. But there is a bedroom which is connected to the master bedroom. That gives me a strange feeling! I have 3 cats and always keep the doors to that spare bedroom closed, because whenever that room is open our cats go in the room and crap everywhere! They always use their litter boxes and never go crap anywhere else in the house!

Also about a week or 2 ago I had my niece over; who is about 1 year and sum odd months old, when my girlfriend and I tried to make her go into the spare bedroom she just would not step foot into the room and started crying. Once not near the room 2 secs later she seemed just fine. I don't know what is going on!

ANOTHER thing happened last night which made me subscribe to this site! First off my sister-in-law's mother died 2 days ago. (don't know if this has anything to do with anything.) But just last night while I was upstairs asleep, or trying to sleep, my girlfriend was downstairs in the living room watching TV and browsing the internet. (by the way the lights were off!) She said that she was just sitting there when all of the sudden she heard some thing. All of the cats were in the living room in her sight. The noise kept happening and then the cats looked like they were staring at something! One of the Cats hair started to stand up on her back. My girlfriend then called my name and heard me respond from upstairs. My girlfriend was wondering what was going on so she got up and flipped on the lights to find out that the cats food dishes made their way from the kitchen to the front door area. (not very far to kitchen to front door, about 15-20 ft.) She then came upstairs and told me what had happened.

I do believe her because one time at my mothers house which is old too, my mothers dog had died. A couple of days later my girlfriend and I were sitting in the living room when no one else was home and it was silent as can be, we heard my moms dog whining just like it did a few days ago when it was alive. I have always had some what weird stuff happen. I have older brothers that have had a lot of crazy stuff happen to them. (seeing stuff, things moving, hearing stuff!)

My question is - is the house I am living in haunted or is it just me? IS MY FAMILY CURSED? I have always thought that my family and I were haunted, we always have to worst luck in the world and the bad stuff only happens to my family and no one else. Crazy questions always cross my mind that I do not like to think of. (did one of my ancestor sell their soul to the devil? To curse this family. Am I crazy?)

PS. My father had committed suicide and I think that his sprit lives in my mother's garage. A place where he spent a lot of time. Working on cars, stuff like that. Even thou the event did not take place there. Sorry for rambling on but bad and weird stuff has happened to me and my family members alike. So is it the house? Me? Family? I need answers! ASAP. If anyone knows or as had things like this occur let me know.

Poltergeist Activity,United Kingdom,Poltergeists / Physical Manifestations,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Poltergeists / Physical Manifestations :: Poltergeist Activity

O ver the past few days I think there is some sort of 'paranormal' activity in my house. It's mostly been small things, here are a few. I poured myself a glass of coke and left it on the counter in the kitchen, my mum called me into the living room and we spoke for a moment then when I went back to the kitchen my drink was at the other end of the counter... I thought nothing of it.

Later that day I was having a cigarette in the garden. In the garden on a table I have 2 lighters, one is green (I keep on the left) and the other purple (which I keep on the right). I glanced at my lighters and went back to my cigarette but when I looked back again having finished my cigarette the green lighter was on the right and the purple on the left, by this time I thought something strange was going on but I put it to the back of my mind.

The next day the microwave turned itself on whilst I was at the other end of the house, lights have been turning themselves on and off occasionally. Whilst watching TV the channels have been changing without me touching the remote. After a few hours of this I knew there was some force at work, I had a sense of something not being right so I called whatever was at work out. I said.

Nothing happened for a few seconds then something struck a note on my guitar which I keep in the corner. Thoroughly freaked out I went out of the house for a few hours and came back to find several things in the house have been moved around. Nothing has happened today and I'm hoping this is all over.

A Message To Her Family,"Arizona, United States",Family / Friends Visits,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Family / Friends Visits :: A Message To Her Family

M y maternal Grandmother was a wonderful woman full of fire and quick wit. She emigrated to the US by herself in the 1920s to attend nursing school in Boston, and never left. She moved in with my family when I was 19 and just leaving for college. In 1994 she was diagnosed with lung cancer and passed away at home with all of us present. I still miss her terribly.

On that day light bulbs blew, the answering machine went haywire and never worked again, and the baby monitor between Gram's room and my Mothers picked up nothing but static. My Mother had been up with her during the night and Gram had told her she was visited during the night by family. ""No one you would know,"" she told my Mother. This was only a few hours before she passed.

She was the matriarch of our family and a great source of love and comfort to those that knew her. When we went on vacations, my sisters and I would fight over who got to share a room with Gram.

Flash forward to Halloween Morning, 2007. I have been in Arizona now for 6 years and am living with my husband in our home outside of Phoenix. October was still a warm month for us here in the desert so we slept with the fan on. My husband had left for work already and I was just laying there half asleep, half awake. I was listening to the whirring of the fan when suddenly I could hear a voice behind the whirring. The voice sounded familiar. Where had I heard this voice? It kept repeating the same thing: ""Just wait until December. Just wait until December..."" I started to repeat it in my head. Suddenly I opened my eyes and snapped myself out of this state. I laid back down and tried to listen to see if I could hear it again. Nothing. I tried several more times. Still nothing. And that voice. I know that voice! It was Grams. Why December? What's going to happen in December?

Being that it was Halloween morning and all I thought for a second that I had somehow conjured this up in my subconscious. However, it all made perfect sense. I was raised Catholic and it is believed that on All Hallow's Eve (Oct. 31st) and All Soul's Day (Nov. 1st) that the veil between the living and dead is the thinnest. We are closer than ever during that timeframe. It is not surprising that if she were going to speak to me it would be then.

Time went by and before I knew it the holidays were approaching. My family all lives in different states and we had been trying to decide forever where to go meet to take a vacation together. We put it off until after the first of the year. December 2007 came and went without incident. I still kept Grams words in the back of my head. In January of this year we finally laid down some concrete vacation plans. In addition to my immediate family going, all members of Grams family have also decided to partake in this reunion of sorts. The month said vacation is going to take place? You guessed it. December.

As I've gotten older I have not experienced much by way of paranormal experiences but this was probably the most pleasant thing I have ever experienced. I believe this was Grams way of letting me know that something great was around the corner and it pleased her to see the family together.

The Girl,"Indiana, United States",Children Who See Spirits,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Children Who See Spirits :: The Girl

F irst I would like to apologize to all who read my first submission, and have been waiting for the rest of the story. (And to those who have not you may want to go back and read Lizzy's Friend , to completely understand this one) Unfortunately, my husband was deployed to Iraq in November, so between work and raising 8 children there has just not been time to sit and write. So again my apologies. Here is the rest of my story.

As you remember, at the age of 2 my daughter started to talking to someone she just called ""the girl"". When my husband came back from Kuwait, and we went back home it did continue for a couple of months and although everyone said it was an imaginary friend, I knew better. Then it just stopped out of the blue.

I thought it was over. A year later we had a beautiful little boy, Logan. 2 years later he was playing in his bedroom, only about 10 feet down the hall from where I was in the kitchen. I could hear him playing and jabbering like little boys do, so was unconcerned. Then I heard him start to giggle. It was not a little laugh, like he thought his toys were fun, this was an all out laugh attack like he was being tickled or thought something was extremely funny. I went in to check on him. He was sitting on the floor surrounded by his tractors, which he loved more than anything. So I thought maybe he was just having fun, and he looked up at me with his big blue eyes and seemed just fine. I went back to the kitchen. Then I heard him start the giggling again, so now my curiosity was peaked.

I snuck down the hall and put my head around the corner into the room to see if I could catch what was going on. He was lying on his tummy, with his hands on his chin, just looking towards the wall and laughing. I went in the room and said ""Logan"" he looked at me. I got down on the floor and put him in my lap. I asked him what was so funny. He pointed toward the wall and said ""gill"". I knew this was his two-year old version of the word 'girl"". My blood ran cold, and my first thought was ""Oh my God she's back""

That night I told my husband about what had occurred. Being a skeptic and one who marked Liz's experience as her imagination, he just laughed it off. I tried to make him see that there was no logical reason for both of our children to talk to a ""girl"".

It continued. Just like our daughter, Logan continued to talk to the ""girl"" and to play with her. By now everyone in our families thought I had lost it by being so freaked out. Then one day my niece made them believe too.

My brother and sister-in-law lived just a few blocks away. Lori, my sis-in-law often came over during the day so Logan and her daughter Myan could play. Myan is about 4 months older than Logan, and could already speak in very clear, concise sentences.

We were sitting in the kitchen talking and the kids were in the backyard. We were sitting by the patio doors watching them. The backyard was surrounded by a 6 foot wooden privacy fence. No way for anyone to get in or out except through the kitchen and out the doors we were sitting in front of. Logan and Myan were playing around the sandbox, looking like they were having a good time. Then Myan fell. She started crying and we opened the doors and went out. Lori picked her up and asked if she was ok. She said she wanted to go home. Lori tried to convince her she was ok and she could keep playing. Myan kept insisting she wanted to leave. So Lori asked her why. She said that the girl pushed her and is mean. We just looked at each other, she could only be talking about Logan's ""girl"". I could see Lori was now a believer.

Like Liz this continued until he was almost three years old, and then also like Liz, one day it just stopped. Now he is 14 and does not remember any of it.

Since then my husband and I have had 6 more children and the ""girl"" has not made another appearance. (That we are aware of). With each child around the age of 2 I have made it a point to keep out a close eye and ear for her.

Our youngest child, a son, Landen just turned 2 in February, so we will see what happens.

Grandfather's Clock,United Kingdom,Family / Friends Visits,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Family / Friends Visits :: Grandfather's Clock

W hen my Grandfather died in 1999, things went strange for a time. We knew it was to do with him because of the nature of the things that were going on. Here is the account of the most obviously bizarre.

Years ago he had bought my Mom a clock for her birthday or for Christmas, I forget which. It was one of those clocks that run off batteries but still have the pendulum beneath, made of a dark wood and having a tendency to make a loud ticking sound. It was kept in the kitchen, because there was no way anyone could fail to be creeped out by the steady tick - tick - tick at night.

On the morning of Granddad's death, the clock froze. The batteries had been replaced only a few weeks earlier, so we thought it was something wrong with the mechanism. We tried everything to get it working again, replacing the batteries, messing with the mechanism - we tried to change the time, but the hands refused to move.

It was late morning when we got a phone call off my aunt, who told us that he had died during the early hours of the morning. We asked her what time - she answered that it was between six o'clock and half past, or so she believed. The clock was fixed at twenty minutes past six. A strange coincidence, or paranormal occurrence? Still, that's not the end of it.

We hung the clock up again - I'm still not sure why, but I have a feeling Mom thought it would offend him to discard it - without the batteries. There it stayed, gathering dust and doing very little. One year to the day later, Mom was startled to hear a loud and distinctive tick - tick - tick as she got ready for work in the morning. She looked at the clock, and saw the pendulum swinging and the clock in full working order, not missing a single minute when she checked it against the other clock.

It was then that she felt at peace. She took it as a sign that he was fine now, that he'd gone on to Heaven and this was his final farewell. I saw the clock ticking that afternoon too, but it only worked for a week until it gave up the ghost (pun not intentional!) for good. We kept it for a while, but in the end it was no more than a broken clock; none of us saw the need to keep it as we had before, and so we got rid of it.

Sinister Presence During my Childhood,United Kingdom,Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: Sinister Presence During my Childhood

I was brought up in a house built in the 17th Century. Overall it has always had a very peaceful atmosphere about it, except for one room. This is the room where I grew up from ages 0-18 and it is at the back of the house off a landing/hall area which is about 15 feet long. The room had a large cupboard which extended to a passage with a spiral staircase down to the basement.

My first experience with the presence in this room was when I was 4. I remember it very vividly. I had a dream of a man's face in a hood staring at me - that's all - just staring, in a humiliating, mocking way. I pulled myself out of the dream, and woke up. All of a sudden, I felt something grab my rib cage under the covers, like a hand grasping at me. I jumped away from the clasp and it cackled, mockingly, in my ear. I ran to the door and started to call for my mother.

As I did so, the light above my bed started swinging and was still swinging when my mother appeared a few seconds after. I told her everything that had happened and she said, at the time, it must have been a dream, the cackle I heard was a fox crying outside in the garden, and I must've woken with a start and knocked my light with my head. (This was impossible, because even when I stood up on the bed, my head didn't touch the light.)

My mother would later tell me when I was 18, that she used to breast feed me in that room in the middle of the night when I was a baby and feel like male eyes were watching her fiercely - staring at her in the same mocking way that I saw the face staring at me.

As time went on and I got older, I used to see apparitions of hornets and wasps appear all over my room: either a swarm of hornets or one single, big hornet, about the size of a juice carton would appear to be flying around the room when I woke up in the middle of the night, and then disappear. Over these years, the male presence was always there. It was a constant, oppressive feeling that I needed to get out of the room or something would ""happen..."" I barely spent anytime in my bedroom and would beg my parents not to have to go to bed.

I was seen by a psychologist for having ""separation anxiety"" as I ended up sleeping in a makeshift bed in the hallway most nights from age 4-13. Everybody called me a ""baby"" because I refused to sleep in this room, and at the time I believed it, but now I know it was more than that. I had to go into the room, of course, because I had to collect school clothes and books etc, but there was only a limited time I could spend in there. The sense that something was about to happen was the constant feeling. If I stayed too long in the room I could feel it circling me.

A shadow would pass by out of the corner of my eye and I felt like it was pushing its face right into mine. I would feel fingertips on my head and a feeling like sheets were swishing past my face and energy was moving around me. When I eventually left the room on these occasions that I felt the oppression, I could feel it follow me down the hall but only go so far. The sense of restriction on it was very obvious to me. It was almost like it was in chains and could go no further, just watch and stare while I went about my business in the other rooms off the hall.

I became quite troubled at age 18 and got very depressed and anxious. This is when the energy appeared to become stronger. I had started reading books about spirits and decided to take the advice in a book I had read and confront it. As I felt it pursuing me down the hall one day, I turned around and faced it and swore at it to leave me alone. I used strong language. I kept shouting at it and pushing it away, trying to make myself more aggressive than the spirit itself, and eventually the feeling left. I felt like I had ""won..."" For a while, anyway.

We started getting recurrent hornet infestations which seemed to manifest from the basement after that time. Big, African hornets would appear out of nowhere, at places in the house. Our neighbours never experienced them, and nobody could understand why they were appearing in our house. I even found three dead hornets in my bed (under the covers!), they would just appear while I was in the shower, or doing work, or when my parents were cooking dinner.

Sometimes my parents would be working in our basement study, and suddenly hear the low buzz of a group of hornets out of nowhere. My mother was very upset by it, and still is. The problem has never seemed paranormal to my father, or any man who has entered that room. It's like the male presence backs down to the male person, but is activated by seeing women. The hornet problem persisted for about three years. We always called the infestation men out and they could never find the nest. I don't think there ever was a nest. When I left home, it gradually stopped.

No-one goes in the room anymore, it is just storage. So occasionally my boyfriend or my father go in to collect something from it. Both of them say they feel absolutely nothing in there. When I visited home a month ago, I wondered past the room and saw the light on. I put my hand around the door and turned it off, then went to the bathroom. I thought to myself while looking in the bathroom mirror ""I wonder if that male spirit is still here?"" Low and behold, when I walked back past the room, the light was back on - just to remind me! Anybody have any clue who this man could be and why it seems so personal to me?

Black Teddy Bear,Philippines,Misc,"I t's been a long time since I have not submitted any stories. Been busy with work for a couple of weeks. My story actually happened about 6 months ago. This took place at my fiance's house. To begin with, my fiance and I are not living together, however, we do have a daughter which was just 8 months old at that time. My fiance, Anthony was taking care of our daughter during that time, as I had to go to work.

One night, our daughter woke up and kept crying. Anthony fixed her milk and tried to cradle her back to sleep. Franz (our daughter) was not pacified. She kept crying and crying. Anthony placed her back in her crib, and noticed that Franz was very uneasy and kept staring at the black teddy bear in the room. No matter how he tried to carry Franz in his arms, Franz would always look back at the black teddy bear. As pissed as he was, he threw a pillow hardly on the black teddy bear. Franz from then stopped crying, drank her milk and went back to sleep. Anthony was puzzled and somehow it gave him the creeps. As there were stories from their helpers, claiming that they see a child running around the room, or a woman sitting in the living room.

As what they said, children are very sensitive to the paranormal. Maybe that certain entity was bothering her that night that made her feel restless. I feel so bad for my daughter.

Harley the Ghost Cat,"Virginia, United States",Pets / Animals,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Pets / Animals :: Harley the Ghost Cat

I 'm 16 years old and I live in VA. I had the same cat since I was a baby, his name was Harley. We were really really close and always together when I was home. Harley got really sick about 7 months ago and we put him on a couple medications but his illnesses were not curable. He slept in the my bathroom bath tub the last few nights of his life and every night I would wake up to him meowing so I would go and see him.

I used to lay in the bathtub with him everyday and cuddle him and when I'd go in there after he died I'd sit in the bathtub and cry and I'd feel warmth on my lap, Harley loved to sit on my lap. Sometimes when I'm in there I'll talk to him and the other day I was in there and there was an empty cup in the bath tub and it started moving.

About a month ago my sister and I both woke up to his meow. Every time I shower, there are noises that come from the bathroom closet and he used to like to be in there when I showered or went to the bathroom. I also feel weighted down spots in my bed at night and he used to always sleep with me.

I recently got a kitten named Tommy due to the depression I went through, I felt I needed another cat. My mom had said that I could never be as close to another cat like I was with Harley, but Tommy and I are always together and where ever I am, he is. I don't know if that has anything to do with Harley but I felt it was a little strange since cats like do their own thing. Like Harley, Tommy is in the bathroom with me when I'm in there and he gets in the bathtub and jumps around and pounces things that aren't there and he'll run around he also does this in my room some nights.

The nights I talk to Harley he's usually in my dream the same night. The dreams are always the same but different locations once it was at my country house, where I got Harley and it was after he died, I went into the shed and he was there and I picked him up and held him and cried. The dreams felt real I could feel his fur and everything. I'm not really sure if all these are things I just imagination because I've never had a ghostly encounter that is so close to me. Can someone give me an opinion?

Ghosts in the Shower,"dry, she knew that there was something going on in the house that is out of the ordinary., Philippines",Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: Ghosts in the Shower

I n 1974, my family and I rented a house for a year while we were searching for a house to purchase. Many things happened during this 1 year stay. There were 3 bathrooms in this house, 2 in the main house and 1 in the outside servant's quarters. All 4 children were locked in at one time or another in the bathrooms. My personal experience with the 1 to 2 hour incarceration was very traumatic for a 10 year old. The bathroom door would not open. It was not locked and the door knob would turn but the door would not open. While I was on the inside, several people from the household was on the outside trying to open the door. Finally, after a couple of hours, the door just opened. This also happened to my siblings.

Several times during our stay, my great aunt would come stay the night. She said that during one of these stays in the late evening when everyone was asleep, she would hear the shower on and she would go and investigate thinking that one of us kids is playing with water. As soon as she enters the bathroom, the shower would stop and there would be no evidence that the shower was ever on: no water in the shower stall. While she was in one bathroom investigating, the shower in the other bathroom would turn on and she would go and investigate that. After finding the shower stall in the same state: dry, she knew that there was something going on in the house that is out of the ordinary.

My mother would also notice that in the mornings, all the closets would be wide open. She thought that the house must be tilted and the closet doors are opening due to gravity. To stop this, she put chairs in front of the closets to stop the doors from opening overnight. The one time she did this, she found all the chairs pushed away from the closets and all the doors where open.

My mother also lost a red cross pendant while we were in this house. She had a set of bright red jewelry which included earrings, a ring and a large red cross, about 2""-3"" long. She usually keeps her jewelry set together so when she lost just the cross and not the earrings or ring, she was sure she didn't keep it in some other place. She searched the whole house and all possible nook and cranny that it could be in but couldn't find it. To this day, she still has the earrings and ring but the cross pendant was never to be found. After leaving the house and realizing that it was haunted, she ""gave"" it to whomever took it.

My father saw a shadow of a young boy walking around his bed and because he was half-asleep, thought that it was my brother. He asked the boy to go back to sleep and my mother was surprised because she said that my brother was asleep in their bed next to my dad.

My sister had bouts of sleepwalking while we were living in this house. She was never known to sleepwalk and has never done so after we left the house. We would find her behind the TV, in the hallway, etc.

The week we were moving out of the house, we left our laundry woman working in the outside servant's quarters while the main house was locked. She said that she heard someone playing with a basketball. Thinking that we were home, she went to the window where she heard the sound and couldn't see the ball or anyone inside the house. However, she could hear the basketball being bounced on the other side of the house. After knocking on the door and determining that no one was home, she also believed that the house was haunted.

Upon leaving the house, our neighbor's finally told us the story of the house. Apparently, the previous owners (not the owners we were renting from) had 2 children: a teenage girl and a young boy. While the parents were on vacation, both children were killed by their nanny while taking a shower. The nanny also preceded to bury the kids under the home's foundation. The bodies have been moved but there is a cement block under the house with the children's names on it.

Dead Relative Among Us,Mexico,Family / Friends Visits,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Family / Friends Visits :: Dead Relative Among Us

W hen I was about three or four years old, my grandfather died in our house. He had a heart attack in his sleep and nobody found out until the next morning. He actually was my grandmother's second husband, and this is to be taken in consideration because not being my mom's father, they did not look alike. Later in my story this will play a role.

When my brother started 1st grade (he's in eight grade now) my mom became friends with a lady who supposedly could ""see spirits"". I must confess that I was a little skeptical about it until something amazing happened.

Our family was going through a hard time due to some problems about a couple of years ago, and my mom's friend assured everything would be okay because my grandfather was taking care of us. My mom was a little surprised by this statement, she did not recall telling her about my grandpa's death, but almost cried when her friend told her he was sitting right next to her and that his hand was resting on my mom's shoulder. My mom asked if it was a joke, but her friend denied it and what she said next shocked us.

She described my grandfather's looks, nothing to do with my mom's because he was a latin-looking man, kind of short, and my mom is white and tall. It's not impossible, but most likely a woman with my mom's looks would have a look-alike dad. Oh, and there is no way Mary (that's not my mom's friend real name, I'll call her Mary) could've met my grandpa because he died before she came to this city. I thought maybe she had seen a picture, but we keep those well hidden so nobody takes them and messes with them. That wasn't everything she said, though. Mary also said my grandpa was wearing a hat he loved but never put on (or at least when he was alive) because my grandmother hated it, she described it perfectly. OK, now we believed... BUT it didn't stop there.

Mary said that sometimes, when she visited our house, she saw my grandpa sitting on a green couch on the corner of the living room. And yes, that was his favorite couch and that was the spot he always used to sit on. Mary said he wasn't alone. When she saw my grandpa, 2 twin brothers were with him, my mom then told us (I didn't know about that either) that they were my grandpa's brothers and they had disappeared a long time ago.

Though he never has let us know about his presence, we all know he is right here with us. And thanks to Mary, we also know he is OK with the people he loves.

Michael Likes the Rain Too,"Oregon, United States",Psychic / Medium,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Psychic / Medium :: Michael Likes the Rain Too

I 'm taking you back to the first time I have ever seen a spirit or ghost. When I was about five I began to feel like there was something else around me that I couldn't explain. Years pasted on and when I was twelve I saw him for the first time. (Keep in mind that this is a different spirit then the one posted in my other stories)

I remember the day. It was April Fifth and it was a rainy day like most days here in Oregon. I like to feel the breeze and hear the sound of rain falling so I often sat in my window and listened. Well on this day I was sitting there and I began to feel like something was watching me. I turned and looked back into my room and saw a young guy, he looked like he was in his early twenties, floating towards me. I sat there in my window and watched it. I was young and didn't know what to do.

He came up and stood next to me and looked out the window. Then he turned and looked at me and said, ""I'm Michael, I'm not going to hurt you. I always listen to the rain with you, it's relaxing..."" I didn't say anything to him because I was afraid like most people.

Michael was around for a couple more years and then one day just up and left.

A month later is when the new spirit arrived. Does anyone think this is connected. Let me know.

Hauntings in my Life,"New York, United States",Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: Hauntings in my Life

H i everyone! I've had a few scary experiences in the past. I kind of hate talking and remembering them because then it gets my imagination working on overdrive. But I love scaring myself so anyways, here it goes. I live on Long Island and know of many scary ""haunted"" places. When I was younger I was always interested in ghosts, probably due to all those darn Goosebump books I read (anyone else read them?).

I've had two experiences in two homes I have lived in with my family. The first experience was when I lived in Babylon down by the water. I'm pretty sure we had a poltergeist in our home (ghosts can't move things correct?). I lived in a ranch home and the downstairs was converted into a playroom for me and my siblings. Behind the playroom was another room which was separated by a door. Back there was the boiler, a bathroom and the garage.

The door leading into the boiler room would always shake violently whenever the boiler came on. My parents said the door would shake due to the boiler running. But can the boiler make a door shake like that? I wish I was older when I lived there so I could have questioned my parents more, I was only in second grade.

My brother was very interested in ghosts as well and had me do a seance with him to bring back the spirit of John F Kennedy (ha ha!) so embarrassing I know, but he had just learned about him in school. So he and I closed all the blinds and performed what we thought was a seance which my brother ended up calling on other ""spirits"". I remember that the room became darker but that was about it. I think that having that seance may have ""opened up"" a door, because after that there were a few odd occurrences which traveled on with us to our next home.

Another embarrassing thing to have happened that I feel so silly talking about is that one night while I was sleeping, I rolled over and saw a dead animal staring at me. It looked like a dead sandy camel. So weird. I just remember freezing and slowly backing up into my wall and putting the covers over my head.

The last scary thing to happen here, my mother and I both witnessed. My mother and I were sitting on the couch and watching tv. We had one of those squeaky baby toys sitting on the tv stand. All of the sudden, something smacked the toy off of the tv stand with such force that it actually made the toy squeak. I thought that was the scariest thing that happened. And my mother told me it was the wind...

My Mom's Ghost,"West Virginia, United States",Family / Friends Visits,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Family / Friends Visits :: My Mom's Ghost

I n the month of April, 2007 my mom was diagnosed with cancer. I just couldn't believe what I was hearing. My mom and I were as close as a son and mother could be. She was my world. My wife and I stood through it all with her. She seemed to do fine with the cancer until one day she seemed to get more sick than ever. Naturally, it scared me to death.

So we took her back to the doctor and he suggested we start chemotherapy immediately. Well I was all for it. At first she didn't want to do it, but I was able to talk her into it. She trusted me as I had taken care of her when she was sickly before. As time passed, she done better and I truly thought it was helping. I was only fooling myself because the cancer was growing worse. She was in and out of the hospital all the time. I took leave from work because at times she wouldn't take the medicine for anyone but me.

My wife and I fed her, as she could no longer do it herself. She said she felt as if though she was being a burden. I made sure she understood that no one ever thought that. I would do it all over again for her if I could.

On the 26th day of September 2007 at 6:15 am she passed away. I was crushed. However the day of the funeral finally came and went. But something strange happened to me the evening of the funeral, I have experienced many things but never anything like what I'm about to tell you.

My wife and I had came home after it was all said and done. She had went upstairs and I remained in the downstairs. I was close to the doorway of my moms bedroom and it was almost as if someone or something was wanting me to come into her room. Well my curiosity got the best of me. So I walked into her room, the smell of baby lotion and freedent gum was evident. Something she loved when she was alive. I wanted to find out what those smells were and where they were coming from. I knew that there wasn't any around the house.

As I began to leave the room, I was stopped at the door by something I couldn't see. The smells became so strong around me it was incredible but at the same time it seemed to change how I was feeling. If I could describe it as it being like flipping a switch or maybe turning a knob then that's maybe the only way I can say it. From that point through out the night it was as if she never left. My mind was at ease. The love that seem to sift through those smells and the feeling that came with it was so totally real. If the heavens above are like that, then for the people who are stricken with cancer of any other disease, NO WORRIES!

The Victorian Ghost,United Arab Emirates,Apparitions / Voices / Touches,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Apparitions / Voices / Touches :: The Victorian Ghost

S everal years ago, my family and I lived in this very old building. We had been tenants for about 16 years. We were to move out as this building was being demolished. As any regular night, my brother and I went to bed. We shared the same room and this detail will be important later on.

We always had a small dim night light on. I would get up once maybe twice a night for a drink of water. At about half past 2, I woke up but was afraid to get out of bed. It was chillier than usual and even with my blanket on, my toes were freezing. I had an overwhelming need to look behind me. We had our study tables at the back. So when I did look... There she was. A woman, dressed from a Victorian era, sitting on a stool and facing me. Her expression was blank, she was not looking at me, but in the same direction as me. She had one leg on top of the other and her hands rested calmly on her knee. She was white, had a lovely white aura and every detail defined, including her bustle and bloomed skirt, and fancy bonnet.

Needless to say I was scared, I jumped right back into bed and pulled the blanket over my face. A few minutes later, I peered out and she was still there. At about the same time, my brothers' pillow fell off his bed and he woke up to retrieve it. He had to get off his bed and so he stood and that's when he saw her too. He was not scared, just curious and flung the pillow at her. In an instant, we saw her go through the window.

We didn't discuss it the next day, but did after we moved out and we both agreed that we saw the same beautiful Victorian lady who visited us that night.

Granny Came Back,"South Carolina, United States",Family / Friends Visits,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Family / Friends Visits :: Granny Came Back

M y mother told me about this when I was a teenager over 20 years ago. This took place way back in the 30's. I don't know what was wrong, but my mother had been very sick and was in bed. One night everyone was in bed and asleep except her. She was just lying in bed and she heard the dogs outside start barking. She noticed that they were barking on the side that faced a cemetery near their house.

The next thing she knew her Great-Grandmother who had died months before came walking through the wall! She noticed that her Great-Grandmother had on the same kind of clothes that she would normally wear around the house. It was dark in the room and my mother couldn't see into her face. She said it was like her Great-Grandmother didn't want her to see into her face. She kneeled down beside my mothers bed as if she were praying. She stayed there for a few minutes praying and then she got up turned around and walked back out through the wall, the dogs started barking again toward the cemetery.

My mother said her Great-Grandmother never said a word to her or looked at her. My mother was too shocked to even be afraid. And the next day she felt well enough to get out of bed.

This is a true story. My mother and Grandparents always told my brothers and myself about ghost encounters they said truly happened to them.

The Spirits of Goodale Cemetery,"Massachusetts, United States",Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: The Spirits of Goodale Cemetery

I n 1997 I moved back into the house I had lived in as a teenager on the Hudson-Marlboro border. My parents were going through a divorce at the time and the house was for sale. For insurance purposes I was asked to live there until it sold. The plot of land the house was on once belonged to the Goodale Family whose old homestead still stood a few miles away, and had been used mainly as farm land. I remember finding old rotted out metal buckets in the woods behind the house and also seeing ancient wagon trails indented in the ground that were now almost hidden by the blueberry bushes.

To give you a little history of the land, the Goodale House was built in the 1600s and is touted as the area's oldest house. It was also a stop on the Underground Railroad. It is a clapboard saltbox with diamond shaped panes of glass in the windows. There is a family that still occupies the home and lives as the Goodales once did; without electricity and other modern conveniences. The family were also the subject of a book called ""Hawaii,"" written by James Mitchener. About a mile from this house is the Goodale Cemetery. It is a perfectly square plot of land surrounded by fieldstone walls and shaded by old oaks and maples. It seem like a very odd place for a cemetery to be but obviously the land had been developed around it during the 200+ years it was used as a burial ground for several generations of the Goodale family.

One evening in the late summer of 1997, myself and my boyfriend at the time decided to go for a walk after dinner. As it was approaching Fall, the evenings had grown much more suitable for such outdoor activities. It was approaching dusk but still light enough to see. We were walking towards the cemetery like we had done many evenings before when all of the sudden there appeared to be something that looked like fire (that is the only way I can describe it) moving through the cemetery. It moved behind the tree and then it was in front of headstones. Then back behind them. We both stopped dead in our tracks. My boyfriend actually put his arm out to keep me from going further. We both looked at each. I said, ""what the heck was that?"" He said he didn't know.

Rather than run in the other direction, which in hindsight would have been the best thing to do, we ran to the cemetery. We looked around the old headstones and there was nothing we could see that would cause that fire-like glow. We stood back in the spot where we had first seen it and waited for a car to go by. There was no reflection that even closely resembled that. I was convinced that what we had seen was not of this world. My boyfriend remained skeptical.

We returned to the house to grab a camera and went back to the cemetery. I asked out loud for permission to take some pictures. I did not feel any negativity and began snapping away. I then said ""thank you"" out loud and started walking home. I took a picture of my boyfriend during the walk home to finish up the film and then brought the pictures the next day to be developed. I swung by after work to pick them up, all the while feeling like I was coming down with something.

There in the photos were zigzagging lights in fluorescent pinks and greens. None of which were visible at the time. What was most shocking was in the photo of my boyfriend there were little red lights behind him that resembled flames. All that was back there behind him were woods. I drove by that area afterwards and there was nothing that the flash could have reflected off of. Nothing at all.

That night I was getting ready for bed when I kept thinking I was seeing things out of the corner of my eye. It looked almost like a tree branch or like a dark lightening bolt (if anyone else has experienced this I would love to hear). The air started to get heavy and oppressive. I have never felt anything like this before. I was starting to feel like I was having difficulty breathing in the house. Finally I fell asleep.

I awoke at 5am to the worst pain I have ever felt. My kidneys felt like they were swollen and were pressing against my ribs. It was excruciating. I woke my boyfriend up crying and he took me to the hospital. I ended up with a severe kidney infection. They gave me antibiotics through an IV and sent me home. I still was feeling very uneasy in the house. I was starting to think that I had ticked off whatever it was we saw at the cemetery and it followed us home. By all accounts the antibiotics should have worked.

In a few more days I found myself in even more pain and went to my regular doctor. She prescribed more antibiotics. The heaviness in the house seem to persist. One evening I heard something that sounded like a board game falling from the top shelf of the closet. Upon inspection nothing had fallen.

I was growing weaker and weaker. Despite the pictures from the cemetery my boyfriend believed we had caught ""something"" on film but he was not convinced it was paranormal. I could no longer stand to be in the bedroom as I was feeling ""preyed upon..."" I started sleeping on the couch in the living room where the air was less oppressive. My boyfriend did not feel any of this.

Finally I went back to the doctors. I was getting gradually worse. The Dr. Sent me to the hospital were I received antibiotics intravenously for three days. Upon returning home I knew that what ever was there was gone. I started to get better. I had lost 11 lbs within a few days. This could all be coincidence but I will say that I have never been into a cemetery to take pictures since.

After that incident, I posted the photos online. I got a few responses about the fluorescent zigzagging lights, but no one could answer for sure what the little red lights behind my boyfriend were. I was told that the fluorescent lights were actually phosphorous escaping from the bones of the deceased, and when the flash from the camera hit them, it caused them to glow.

I never passed that cemetery again without a feeling of apprehension. I believe whatever we saw is still there; watching, waiting. Thanks for reading. I have included a link to some info on the house and the grounds for anyone interested. There's a picture of the old Goodale House, too.

Oaklawn Cemetary,"Florida, United States",Ghost Hunting,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Ghost Hunting :: Oaklawn Cemetary

I went on my VERY first 'GHOST HUNT' to a cemetery called ""Oaklawn Cemetery"" in downtown Tampa. My fifteen year old daughter, almost five year old son and three year old daughter arrived at this cemetery at around 4-4:30PM. Just to let everyone know, my children are not frightened by any of this. They are more respectful and very interested in the subject. My fifteen year old daughter has had MANY paranormal experiences in her young life and we together created a light bulb to brighten REALLY bright and make a buzzing noise and then dim and then repeat itself while during a heated argument that her and I had in her room one day. I believe that was the kinetic energy that was happening between us BOTH. As for my son, he has seen his Papa who past away a little over a year ago. He is fascinated by the whole paranormal experiences rather than freaked out. As a matter of fact, after an hour of him non-stop talking about it after we had left the cemetery, and wanting to see the pictures we took, we had to tell him okay enough! And my three year old doesn't have a clue yet.

It had been a bad overcast all day long so it seemed like it was around 6:30PM rather than the time it actually was. To get along with my story, I have been to this cemetery many times in the past. I would say the last time I was there, before this time, was in 1998. I always got this feeling when I walked into this particular cemetery like you are being watched, but not by anything sinister necessarily. I never took any pictures in a cemetery before and never this one. I have never went on a 'ghost hunt' before either. I've only accidentally caught them on film before. This time I went purposefully to capture some kind of spiritual activity on film.

So, we all start to walk into the gates of the cemetery and the wind picked up quickly and it was bone chilling cold. Now, it was not cold on this day, nor was it hot, just overcast (remember, I live in Florida). Then it started to sprinkle rain, then it started to pour! We saw a wooden shed type building painted in white with a covered deck to take cover. There were no benches or anything just a small covered deck to sit or stand on the floor of. I don't know what the shed was used for, maybe shovels, and lawn equipment or things to repair the headstones with when they are damaged. Who knows, who cares! It kept us from getting soaking wet! To get along with the story. The instant we walked in there, we felt pulled in all different directions. However, we had to wait under this white, wooden building until, hopefully, the rain let up.

So, we sat there talking while it rained maybe a good 10 minutes and then it lightened up. At this point, I stood up from this wooden deck of this building and was compelled to take a photo directly in front of me. It was my very first picture and I actually caught something unbelievably interesting! There were orbs with tails shooting up into the air all over the place and then by one of the last trees to the right, there is another orb but the tail end seems wider in girth. Almost like it was forming somewhat of a figure. Now mind you, it is lightly raining still when I took this picture. You can see the rain in the picture. Also, in the top right hand corner of this picture of orbs there is a strange looking, well I wouldn't call it an orb, but WHAT IS THAT?! It has the shape of a butterfly. Very odd to me. Now, I am one of the first to debunk or not give much thought on orbs because they could be caused by any number of things. However, these particular orbs are much different. Oh, and we were THE ONLY ones in the cemetery the whole time.

I really think that I actually caught something on this photo and I want to know what everyone else thinks of them! I also have another photo of what I believe to be a 'shadow man', but I am going to put that picture on another page/story so this is not so long.

Oaklawn Cemetary 2,"Florida, United States",Ghost Hunting,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Ghost Hunting :: Oaklawn Cemetary 2

T his is my second photo that I wanted to submit and share with everyone to see what you think about this one. Okay, so as you already know I went to the Oaklawn cemetery and we are walking around snapping photos in places that we are drawn to snap the pictures. This picture was also shot on the same day as the other photo I submitted. On this particular one, I felt the need to take a photo in a certain area. What I believe I caught on this picture was what 'WE' call a 'Shadow Man'. When I took this picture I DID see this man on the outside of the cemetery bending over unlocking his car to get in. This would be the man on the left hand side.

Then if you look a few feet to the right, you can see another man that was ABSOLUTELY NOT THERE when I took this picture! Also, NOT ONLY was it that the man on the right hand side WAS NOT THERE when I snapped this photo but there is a significant difference in their appearances only being a few feet away from each other. The man, on the left, bending over to get into his car is in full, normal color and he looks like he belongs. However, the man or 'being', if you will, on the right hand side is only a few feet away, so not much difference in lighting, is a dark gray color with no features, nor color except the outline of his face, upper body and you can see that he has either a ball cap but looks more like a trucker's cap on his or 'IT'S' head. It looks as if he is somewhat see through but not because he is somewhat dense in this dark gray color and he also seems a bit blurry.

It looks to me like this man or 'being' is watching this other man getting into his car, kind of hiding a little behind the tree as to maybe not be noticed, maybe curious?! He looks out of place and like I said I know for a fact that this 'being' or man was NOT there when I took the picture. So what other explanation could there be.

Also, as we were walking out of the cemetery my daughter spotted a black shadow flit in between the trees. As we were nearly out through the gates of the cemetery, that cold wind started picking up again and felt like it kind of gave us a push out of the cemetery. My daughter said, ""Mom, did you feel that!"" She said, ""It felt like they (spirits) were pushing us out!"" I said, ""Yes, I did feel that!""

As we were going to get in the car on the outside of the cemetery walls, my son needed help tying his shoe. As I was helping him, my fifteen year old daughter was leaning on the stone wall looking into the cemetery and she said, ""Mom, I saw that black shadow again!"" By this time I was done tying my sons shoe and went to take a picture of where she was seeing this dark shadow flitting in and out of the trees but EVERY SINGLE TIME I tried to take a picture, my camera kept dying! Come to think of it, there were a couple other times while we were in the cemetery that my camera kept on dying and would take a while to be able to take another picture.

Eventually, when we were leaving in the car, before we pulled out of the parking lot, my daughter was trying to look at the pictures to see if we caught anything but the batteries in the camera were completely drained and it wouldn't work. Now, I left my house with brand new batteries in my camera, but stupid me forgot to bring extras knowing full well that it was a possibility that going on a 'ghost hunt' could drain the batteries from the spirits trying to manifest. I guess I really didn't expect much on my trip or especially my VERY FIRST ghost hunting trip. BOY was I joyfully surprised!

So, let me know what everyone thinks because I REALLY think that I got VERY lucky that particular day! What do you think?!

Demonic House in Mexico,Mexico,Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: Demonic House in Mexico

E ver since I can remember I have always heard that my grandparents house was haunted. My father as well as my other 8 aunts and uncles lived there until they married, and they all described to me the same ghosts. They all told me that at night a young woman would appear and tell them that she had killed her mother in the land that the house is build on. She would also say that her husband killed her as well and also buried her in the property. I was a skeptic a first, but what got me believing was that they all described the lady the same way. Tall young woman around 20-21 with long solid black hair. All my aunts and uncles told me she looked like people from the 1800's

This was not the only ghost. They would also describe whatd seemed like a demon. They told me that he would open the door to their rooms and he was always dressed different. He would stand at the door way and just laugh or even choke them at times. I believe it was a demon because one terrifying account my aunt told me. She said she was woken up to the sounds of evil music as she described it. She said it sounded like organs. She then said that her door slammed open and she saw the same man she always saw and he started walking up to her but as he walked, he took the form of many people. She told me that every step he took he was a different person, but every form he took had completely BLACK eyes. She then told me after a while he just disappeared. Every body saw this man but my aunt grace saw him THE MOST in particular.

Another story she told me was that when she had just giving birth to her oldest son (she was out of the house by that time) she stayed in my grandparents house because her husband (my uncle) worked all night and she did not want to be alone with the newborn. She described that late one night she woke to the sound of hands clapping. She said she opened her eyes and saw just a pair of hands

clapping over her baby's crib. She has never slept at that house since.

Back to the first story about the young woman. Like 5 years ago my dad along with my uncles made a hole in the floor in one of the rooms were the ghost claims her and her mothers bodies were. My dad claims as they dug they heard a voice saying ""keep digging you are almost there just a little bit more"" and also they heard like coins being thrown around. Which motivated them to dig more because they thought they had found money. (back in the days many people in mexico use to bury their money). After 2 days of digging they found the remains of only one body (bones and hair). The bones were buried in a cemetery and given a proper burial. Currently no body lives in the house.

But every year we always have a party in the house with all my aunts and uncles. Every summer we go to mexico to visit my family. On my last days there we had a party like we always do. I was having so much fun I went to the bathroom by myself (WICH I NEVER DO in that house!) I was washing my hands when I heard I loud thump on the door like somebody crashed against it. THEN I heard it again but this time repeated like if somebody had to go really bad, but when I opened the door there was nobody. At this point I felt like screaming but I was stunned, then I started hearing like somebody was whispering in my ear at that point I just ran with tears coming out my eyes, but I was not crying (I was 21 at the time) I was just that scared because I had never seen or heard anything before.

There are so many other stories about that house but those are just some. Please tell me what you all think. I will go back to mexico this summer to visit again.

My Son Sees,"Tennessee, United States",Children Who See Spirits,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Children Who See Spirits :: My Son Sees

F rom the time my son was just a few months old until the time he started kindergarten, he frequently saw things that no one else saw. One evening, I was sitting in our bedroom floor, playing with him when he started looking at the rocking chair behind me - like someone was sitting in it. When I looked, the front of the rocking chair was rocked forward - like someone was sitting in it. When he was old enough to talk, he described my own grandmother to me. There was absolutely no way that he could have ever seen her since she died before I even started to date my husband. My son was able to describe her fully - including her ""humped"" back - that she was careful to never show in pictures.

My grandmother wasn't the only one who came to see my son - she was just the first he was able to describe. The strangest visitor my son had was ""Baby"". He had a baby that he played with for years - that no one else could see. The strange thing about ""Baby"" was that sometimes when my son was riding in the backseat of the car in his child seat, you could almost see two children in the backseat of the car. ""Baby"" would always just sit beside my son's car seat. I spent months trying to figure exactly who ""Baby"" was. All of the other people that my son saw were family members - and I could easily figure their identities out once my son was able to talk.

It became clear to me who ""Baby"" was when my son was about two and a half years old. I had a brother who died before I was born under very similar circumstances that my son was born under. My son and my brother were both in December (around Christmas) and were premature. The same condition caused both of their premature births. Getting back to the story, I took my son to the graveyard where my brother is buried late one afternoon. As soon as I let my son out of his child seat in the backseat of the car, he went to my brother's grave, sat down, and started to talk to the grave marker. When I asked him who he was talking to, he told me that he was talking to ""Baby"".

""Baby"" stayed with us until right before my son started to school. My son still talks about missing ""Baby"" even though he hasn't seen him in years.

Ghost Making Me Dizzy,United Kingdom,Psychic / Medium,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Psychic / Medium :: Ghost Making Me Dizzy

T oday was a very strange day as my daughter actually finally WANTED to help me out with packing her school packed lunch. I said 'no kaylee,' because there's nothing she really needs to help with. So I started the car and left Kaylee in there so she can listen to the radio as she was waiting for me to finish. It took me about 10 minutes to pack her lunch today which is NOT me at all. I usually only take five minutes but today was very different.

I walked out into the hallway where I felt light-headed and I also felt as though someone was putting EXTREME pressure on my head. I thought this was pretty strange so I looked out the lounge window to see whether Kaylee was alright.

As I walked into the lounge, (which is on my left), I suddenly recovered from the dizziness and my bad headache. My senses told me this room was protected by god and his angels. I think that's nonsense now because I've NEVER IN MY LIFE thought anything as immature as that.

After I walked back into the hallway, I felt dizzy, achy and like someone was putting extreme pressure on my head again. I walked back out the front door, and as you can guess, I felt fine. When I got outside, I think I could make out a white misty figure creeping out of the top middle window. By then, as you can guess, I was extremely freaked out.

Please comment and tell me if there is a logical explanation. And just because I'm a psychic lady, doesn't mean I know about ghosts and spirits. By the way, I don't know EVERYTHING about the future so please try to support me.

Supernatural Babysitting Service and the Monster in my Room,United Kingdom,Children Who See Spirits,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Children Who See Spirits :: Supernatural Babysitting Service and the Monster in my Room

U p until I was about five or six, I lived in a house in Birmingham that wasn't in a very nice area. When we moved out, it was demolished to make way for a small industrial park. All pretty normal there. But that house was the centre of a lot of ghostly goings on based around me and my mother, most often involving my deceased grandmother who had been dead for around fifteen years by the time I was born.

My mother often says of how I would disappear into my room for hours at a time, before coming back and saying I'd been playing with a lady. She expected it was an imaginary friend of some sort, and thought little of it - what else was she meant to think? But one day, my parents took my to my maternal grandfather's house for a visit, and I noticed a photograph I'd never seen before. According to my mom, I pointed at the woman in the photo, my grandmother, and said something along the lines of: ""Mom! Look, that's the lady I play with!""

This terrified her, not because she doesn't like the idea of ghosts but because she didn't want Granddad to know that I was claiming to be playing with his dead wife, especially since before that time I had never seen a picture of her - this was before I turned three and got the patience to sit through family photo albums. She had been aware of her mother in the house, particularly in the kitchen (for some reason, around us all ghosts retreat to the kitchen!) when she was cooking, and so immediately thought that it had been her looking after me when she was too tired to deal with a child. A supernatural babysitting service, if you will.

There was another occurrence in my bedroom there when I was about four or five that terrifies me to this day if I think about it too hard. I couldn't sleep for some reason, and was lying in bed bored out of my mind when I thought of reading a book by the light from my nightlight. I was sitting on the floor, quietly reading in an attempt to send myself to sleep, when I heard really heavy footsteps coming up the stairs and onto the landing, heading for my door. Thinking that I'd get in real trouble if I was caught (and anyway it was getting a bit cold by this point), I naturally dove into bed and acted as though I was asleep.

The footsteps stopped when they entered my room, and I cracked an eye slightly open to see if they were convinced (I know, I know, forgive my kid's reasoning!) and had the biggest scare of my life. There was a man there, his face in shadow because his back was to the light, and he was terrifying. He had wild hair in some sort of twisted halo about his face, I think it was red, and a long shirt on that was untucked from his trousers. He was like a silhouette in three dimensions; the only colour I could see was around the edges where the light was hitting him. To this day, just picturing him in my head makes my mind shudder away and it takes ages for me to calm myself down.

I used the most powerful guard any child has - the duvet. Yanking it over my head, curling up to make myself as small as possible, I made my breathing as quiet as I could and lay there listening to my heart beat as I prayed to God or whatever was listening to not let the monster get me. Every time I closed my eyes, it was as if an imprint of the man had burned itself into my eyelids so I kept my eyes open until they were watering just so I didn't have to blink and see him again. He registered as a monster to me, and I was so utterly scared even when I thought I should yell for help I just couldn't let any sound escape my lips.

Eventually I fell asleep (or passed out in terror, take your pick) and woke up the next morning to a nice, monster free room. I thought I might have made a mistake, that it was one of my parents coming in to check up on me after hearing noises, and so to stop myself working into a frenzy the next night I asked them if they came in. The answer was no, both had slept like logs all night.

That experience meant I couldn't sleep without the duvet over my head until I was fifteen years old, and even now I imagine a thick strong shield around me every night before I sleep, no matter how tired I am. I have three wind chimes and three dreamcatchers in a little triangle around my bed, too. Even if it doesn't do any good up against ghosts and monsters, at the very least it let's me sleep peacefully.

I'm still not sure if I'm sad that a piece of my history was lost when the house was knocked down, or glad that no-one else encountered that monster. I'm not even sure if I ever will be.

Wanita's Trailer,"Michigan, United States",Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: Wanita's Trailer

T his took place in the late 1980's in Michigan. I was living in a run down, crime filled trailer court. With my two sons at the time. I should have known the first night we were at the trailer court, when this man shot his ex-wives boyfriend and killed him. That it was not a place to live with small children. But by then I sank in all I had for this trailer and so, it was going to be our home for awhile.

This trailer court was the 3rd worst in that county out of the ten worst. However when I first bought it, I didn't know that until I investigated it later.

It was winter time, and my heating tape went out. When I woke up the next day to get the kids to the sitters, and myself a shower to go to work. I notice there was no water, that would come out of the faucet. I asked people near me what, would cause this and they told me about the electric tape. That was located under the trailer. I didn't have time to look then. So called my brother in law. He came over and found it went out, and got a new one put on.

Even with the new tape on the water pipes. It would take some time to unthaw the pipes. I needed a shower so went to my neighbors house, Wanita and ask her if I could use her shower. She said it be fine. The kids had a shower at the sitters, so they would be fine. I went into her house. We sat down in her living room. I felt odd being in there, not sure because I came there to use the shower, or something else.

I used her shower and felt someone was watching me. I got out and still felt something, however I didn't see anything. I used her shower for a couple times and then, my own water was on. Then my hot water heater went out. I used her shower again.

I told her I thought the bathroom was cold, she said by the bathroom it was always cold. That I could leave the door open. I did. I took my shower and got out dried off. When I looked up I seen a young man, about his early 20's looking at me. I froze in my spot. I open my mouth to scream nothing came out. When I was able to move, I went through that man to the hallway. To Wanita sitting watching tv, I peeked down the hallway the man wasn't there.

She looked at me asked me what was wrong. I told her I seen a ghost and walked through him. She smiled at me and told me, it was her son. She continue to tell me this.

Her son was running from the police. He had gotten himself into drugs and was being chased. He ran into her home, when she was not at home and with the trailer easy to fire through. The police shot into the trailer. Killing her son by the bathroom door. The wall across the door, was blood splattered of her sons blood. So her daughter just covered it with wall paper. If I noticed on the door frame in the bathroom, there is still blood on it. She said no matter how hard she tried to get the blood off, it won't go away it keeps coming back.

She told me she came home to find her son dead in the hallway, by being fired upon by the police. It went through the trailer. She said she could have moved but she felt at peace in the trailer from her sons spirit, which she has often seen herself. Sometimes she said he looks transparent, sometimes he looks like solid form. He smiles at her and then he is gone.

Well it wasn't that day I wanted to look at the doorway. But in time I did. The blood is there on the door frame of the bathroom door. I never took a shower in that bathroom again. I never went to the bathroom in there, I would go home. I did go to her trailer if she went to the bathroom. I stood on the porch till, she came back into the living room. After that I told her I felt more comfortable being on the porch, or in the winter time she came to my place.

Wantia continued living in the trailer court, when I moved out of the trailer park. Eventually she moved back to Paris, KY from where she was from. I have not heard from her in a long time, so she may be with her son and God by now.

The Whisper Demon,Georgia,Ouija Board / Seances,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Ouija Board / Seances :: The Whisper Demon

I am Alexandrea Pentel (people call me alex) I am now 15 years old, but my story happened when I was 11. My oldest brother, Paul was 19, and my second oldest brother, Ren was 13, and my little sister, Danny, was 7. Danny and I were dropped off from school by a carpool mom, and we started walking home. We started walking up the driveway, and we noticed our brother, Ren with his friend (whose name I forget) through the window. We opened the door, and we saw a ouija board on the coffee table. Ren's friend had told him about ouija boards, and Ren wanted to play around with it.

When we walked in, their hands were on top of a glass placed in the middle of the board. They were asking questions, but they had no reply. He finally took the time to look at me, and he told me not to tell our parents about the board. Even though I sometimes hated my brother, I agreed not to tell. But, he refused to tell me what the board was, and why they were using it. Back then, I was clueless about the paranormal, I had no idea what a ghost was, or demon, anything that had to do with paranormal, I didn't know.

Later on that day, it was around seven, and I was helping danny with her math, while Paul was watching television, and Ren was in his room doing whatever. I got up from the table, and went to the living room with Paul, wanting to watch television with him, but he told me to go away, and that he was in charge. My parents worked late shift, and never got home until midnight. Paul always had to drive us to school and take care of us. But then he got the false sense of power, and did what ever he wanted to do.

Anyway, I went to my room, but I left a couple seconds after I stepped into the room. When I walked in there, there was a horrible chill. It felt like the air was frozen in my room, but it was warm outside in the hall. I walked back to the living room, and said nothing. I couldn't explain it to my brother, he would just think I was crazy.

The next morning, it was saturday, so I didn't have to go to school. I went to go see if Danny is awake, because she usually is the first one to be awake. I walked into her room and sat on her bed, trying to wake her up. When I finally woke her, I heard breathing sounds behind me. The feeling that someone was in the corner of the room, staring at me. Danny started getting scared when she heard the breathing sounds too. We hurried, and ran out of there, and then we slammed the door.

We ran into our parent's room, and told them that there was someone in Danny's room. Our parents didn't really care about the story. They just said that it was early, and we were hearing things because we weren't fully awake yet. Then they told us to leave their room. We went to the living room, and turned on the Television, hoping it would calm us down. Danny wouldn't move three inches away from me, and I didn't move away from her. We were so scared, we wanted to just leave, and never come back.

Paul walked in the kitchen and saw us on the couch. He looked at us, and asked us what was wrong. We turned our heads and then we said there was someone watching Danny in her room. Paul grabbed some orange juice and sat on the couch beside us. He looked at us right in the eye end said that if see something, like a moving shadow, or any kind of scary thing, we need to tell him about it. Of course we had no clue about what he was talking about, but we nodded our heads and agreed.

Later that day, Mom and dad left for work, and it was just the kids inside the house. Ren forced us all to watch a scary movie. I wanted nothing to do with anything scary, I was a total chicken. But, I wanted to act tough when my brothers were around, so I said yes. We put in the movie, and turned the television on, but after a couple of seconds, it turned off by itself. Ren got up and turned it back on. Then, it turned off again. Danny and I started to panic. Ren got up again, but he backed away, when he saw a Man in the reflection on the television screen. The man was staring at Ren From behind all of us. He spun around, and no one was there. He backed up against the wall, he looked like he wanted to scream. Danny ran up to him, and then he said he had to get out of the house. The rest of us started to panic, and fled the house.

We all got in Paul's car, and we drove off. I think I was most upset out of all of them. I had no idea what was going to happen. I heard Ren in the car talking about how a ghost was in the house. Then he told me and Danny what a ghost was. I was in pure shock. I couldn't even think of anything. He told me it was someone's soul walking the earth, when they are already dead.

When we got home, our parents were very upset. They grounded us for a month of no television. We tried to explain it to them, but they just became more furious, and send us to our room. There, in the middle of the night, Ren and Danny came into my room. They said that the ghost started shaking Ren's bed, and made whispering noises. I could tell that Ren had reached his limit. He was even planning to call a investigation team while mom and dad were gone. I agreed, and so did Paul when we told him.

The next night, we called Lorraine Warren , and we described the attacks of the spirit. She told us that it wasn't a human spirit, it was a Demon. When our parents got home, the were attacked by the demon that night, and then they packed their things, took us, and fled the house. They wouldn't tell us what happened, but it was so horrible, that they sold the house.

A new family moved in, and moved out the next month. Thanks for reading, Bye!

Clara and the Nursing Home,"Michigan, United States",Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: Clara and the Nursing Home

A ll names in this story, are not the person's real names. I had been taking care of an elderly lady in her home. Once she passed on I was looking for another job. I seen in the paper this nursing home not far from me, was hiring people to work there. I applied and got the job.

I had four people to care for, Fred and older man who was in a wheel chair (remember this), Clara an older woman left there by her kids, she was in great health, Candy a 20 year old mentally impaired, and Bill a yeller and screamer, never happy about anything.

Candy had the mind of an 6 or 7 year old. She tell me people came into her room, and beat her up a lot. I do know she had many nightmares.

Clara told me people got beaten and killed in this nursing home, people they got tired of taking care of, or people that told to much what was going on here, in the nursing home.

Fred said some of his friends just went missing and they weren't even sick.

I met Bonniesue, a nurses aide she was very nice and she would be the one to train me, on the job routine. After two weeks of training I was on my own. That twice a month everyone worked the grave yard shift. I usually worked days or afternoons.

The first night of working the grave yard shift. I hear screaming down the hallway. I went down the hallway to see what is going on. I can't find where the screaming is coming from. I checked all the rooms in my area. Everyone seemed to be sleeping. The screaming noise seemed to blend into the hallway walls. I went back to the desk. When Audrey came back from her end of the hallway. I told her what happen. She told me she hears that all the time.

The next time I worked the grave yard shift not only where there noises of screaming, but I could see people walking the hallways. As I watched them they seems to either disappear into the walls or just vanish. I got the shivers and hoped I never have to work the grave yard shift by myself.

I told Bonniesue about this she told me ""Many times you see, feel, smell, and something touch you, that you just can't explain"". She told me this happens in the day time hours too. The screaming she said she has not been able to find, out where it comes from. But she is sure it's from someone being hurt.

I was off a day came back to find Bill with bruises on his face and arms and a cast on his leg. I asked what happen to him. I was told ""He fell out of his bed last night"". My gut feeling didn't tell me that. I told that to Bonniesue, she said he didn't fall out of bed. I said so what happen? She told me for my own good, it's best I didn't know.

Candy had just had her 22nd birthday and was found dead in her bed. She was in good health. Down the hallway the other way, another person was also found dead in there bed. I never knew that man. He was not on the hallway, where I worked.

I often took Clara out to eat lunch, get her hair down and do some shopping. She said ""People that know too much or are a burden to the people that work there, are killed or beaten up. It happens a lot of the time. Can you please let me live at your house?"" I did look into if she could, but her kids were her guardian and they had to give permission and they couldn't be found.

I was with Clara all day on my day off. We had fun, she didn't want to go back to the nursing home, and was crying. She said someone tried to suffocate her last night. I was beginning to believe what was going on there. I wanted to protect her she became a great friend to me. But I couldn't take her home with me for the night. She could be gone from 9am but had to be back by 4pm.

I bought food for us and we ate at the picnic tables on the grounds for dinner time. She liked that. I just felt that I wanted to stay with her forever.

The next day when I went to work, I went to check on Clara. She was not in her room. Just then I seen her coming down the hallway. ""Hi Clara how are you today?"" It felt as if she walked right through me. I got the shivers. I looked back and didn't see her. I went to the desk ask Audrey, what happen to Clara? ""Oh you didn't hear from Bonniesue?"" I said no. ""What happen to her."" ""Oh when Bonniesue went to her room to check on her, she was having hard time to breath, she died"".

I seen Clara all day that day, down the hallways, in the bathroom, outside by the tree. It was as if she wanted me to know something. But I just couldn't' figure it out and I was frighten too. I gave my two week notice I would be quitting there.

Not long after that Bonniesue called me up. It was not quite 4am. I heard her voice ""Come quick to the store NOW"". I knew she was either frighten or excited by her voice. I got there she told me this ""I went to check on my patients, Fred is one of them along with three others. The others were in there bed sleeping. I couldn't find Fred"". I asked Audrey if she seen Fred. She said ""not tonight. I walked down the hallway of screaming, into the cafeteria. I flipped on the light and there was Fred hanging"". ""What? He can't get out of his chair by himself!. Who helped him?"". She said she phoned the police. Now they believe me when I say something is going on here.

Bonniesue told me every time someone died, she phoned the police and tell them. But they never believed her. If it weren't for Fred not being able to get out of his chair alone, she said they still not believe her. But he didn't hang himself.

The place was closed down. Audrey was arrested along with some other employees and the owners. They left patients in there beds for days wet and stinking, the kitchen where food was prepared was not up to health standards, people died mysterious deaths, some were not claimed as dead and yet money the nursing home still got.

Bonniesue became a Registered Nurse. She works in a hospital helping accident victims. She loves her job. And told me the last time I seen her. ""I protect all my patients the best that I can"".

The place was tore down, and a parking lot made in its place. Now that the parking lot is for the nearby Church, a Holy place. Maybe now the spirits of the dead, that died there when it was a nursing home. Maybe they are finally at rest.

The Curve in the Road,"Michigan, United States",Psychic / Medium,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Psychic / Medium :: The Curve in the Road

T his took place in Michigan in the late 1980's. There was this nice newly paved road, near the country. However it had a really sharp curve in the road. One couldn't go to fast or you might end up in farming land some place.

My friend Cheryl and I would take this road, to go to the fruit stand at then end of the road with the curve in it. I told Cheryl that every time that I got close too the curve when I drove, or anyone drove that I felt sick. She said she didn't notice. So we were about to get near the curve in the road. I said ""Do you feel that presence, like someone is here with us?""

She said no she didn't feel anything. Once I would pass the curve and got to end of the road, I felt okay once again.

Cheryl and I was coming down that road, late one night from a friends house who had a tupperware party. We were at the cross road, the windows down in the car and we heard what sounded like a car crash. I said ""Cheryl did you hear that?"". She said yes and was gripping the seat with her hands. I thought someone hit us. I parked the car and got out with the flash light, looked around with Cheryl in tow. We were not hit. But we heard the noise, it was a car crash. No other cars did we see on the road.

We went on down the road, I then said ""I know the person who just had the car crash, he is dead his name is Mark"". She said what you talking about? The car crash that just happen, it's Mark I know him. She states we didn't see any car crash, what am I talking about. I didn't know what to tell her I just knew.

About a week later we went back down the road with the curve in it, and just as we rounded the curve, I said. ""Look there is the car wreck, Mark is wrapped around the tree, we got to see if he is okay"". I stopped the car, got out to look, how could he be alive the whole tree had the car wrapped around it. I could see him hanging out of the car. I knew he was dead. Cheryl is upset, wants to go home, tells me I am seeing things. I said ""Look Cheryl at the tree, can't you see him? She said no.

I felt I had to get to the fruit stand, quick to call the police. I got to the fruit stand, told the older lady a wreck happen down by the curve, the man appeared to be dead, his name is Mark. She looks at me. Yes his name was Mark. But the accident didn't just happen. It's been a few days ago. My hubby and I heard the noise. We knew it was a car wreck. It happen about 4am. My husband went out to see where it happen. He couldn't find it. Wasn't until daylight he went out and looked again. He then found the car wrapped around the tree. The young man in it was dead.

I said his name is Mark. The lady told me yes again. I said I used to take care of him when he was a baby. He wasn't too old now maybe his early 20's. She said yes your right. I went home called my sister, asked her about Mark. She told me he appeared to be going to fast on the road, it was raining and once he went to go around the curve in the road, he skidded up and over the guard rail and hit the tree. The doctor said he most likely died instantly. All the bones in his body were broken. He had no seat belt on.

I told her I seen the car today on the tree. She just said you might have with your sixth sense. I told her I knew he had the crash before it happen too. She just nodded her head. Mark did indeed have the car accident, did indeed die in it, and the tree he hit, still has the marks on it, from his car.

I investigated the accident, where Mark was at. It appeared he was in the car to me, hanging out. However he was under the car that was smashed into the tree, making him hang out from under the car.

Every time I had to go down that road at night time. I see the tree, I see the car wrapped around it. I would see Mark hanging out of the car. When I went down the road in the day time, I feel the crash way before I got to the curve in the road. I would get sick to my stomach. Once passed the tree I felt okay once again.

My Wedding Day,"Tennessee, United States",Family / Friends Visits,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Family / Friends Visits :: My Wedding Day

I would like to begin by giving you all a little background on my Mother. My Mother was a wonderful person. She was in every sense of the word a lady. Mom loved butterflies, she pasted stickers with butterflies and flowers on the walls of her house. She also loved hummingbirds, any birds really but especially hummingbirds.

Mom was diagnosed with cancer for the second time sometime around Christmas of 2004. It became apparent early in 2005 that she wasn't going to make it through this particular battle. Mom asked me if I would go find this guy I had dated in high school that she and my Dad both just loved. His name is Jackie.  I found him and told him that Mom wanted him to come to see her before she passed away.

He went the same week to see her and started going to see her 2 to 3 times a week. Mom passed away May 25th, 2005. Mom had a different kind of humor about her and sometimes you couldn't tell if she was joking or not. I remember her telling me she would come check on us (us being her 8 children and various son-in-laws she felt particularly attached to) when she was gone. Mom always did believe in that kind of thing.

After she passed away I started dating Jackie. Mom always said she thought I should have married Jackie when I dated him in high school.  In September of 2007 Jackie and I got married at 6 pm in the church I grew up in. The day of the wedding I left home at noon, I got about 1/2 a mile from my house when I drove into what I describe as a ""cloud"" of little purple butterflies. I immediately thought of Mom. I called my sister from my cell phone to tell her what had happened and she too thought it could be Mom.

I went on to the church and got ready for the wedding, everything went off without a hitch. Jackie and I arrived home after the wedding and had dinner, because it was a fairly nice evening, not too hot and not too cool, we went out and sat together on the front porch swing. We sat there for a little while just talking and holding hands when I saw a hummingbird. It just kind of buzzed around a little bit and left so I didn't think much of it. Then 3 or 4 hummingbirds came buzzing around, this was getting a little weird, but they left too. Then about 8 or 9 hummingbirds came buzzing around. Now I guess I should mention here that I have never put hummingbird feeders out at my house.

At this point I was pretty sure that my Mom was responsible and I like to think she was saying congratulations.

Headache of a Paranormal Kind,Australia,Apparitions / Voices / Touches,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Apparitions / Voices / Touches :: Headache of a Paranormal Kind

T his event happened early in 2007. As a member of Couples for Christ, one of our obligations is to attend weekly meetings with our household group. In short, each couple within our group would take turns to host these weekly meetings, where we would gather, pray, and read a scripture from the bible.

During this particular week, the youngest couple within our group of 6 couples, hosted the meeting. They had just bought their first home a year earlier.

My family arrived, along with the others and everything started off smoothly until we got to the end of our prayer session. I suddenly got this huge migraine. It hit me like a ton of bricks. My husband knew something was wrong with me, discreetly directed me into the kitchen and asked what was wrong.

As soon as we stopped in the kitchen, my headache disappeared as if nothing had happened. I said, ""I don't know. I had this massive headache but now it's gone..."" Shrugging my shoulders, we both walked back into the family room to listen to the bible reading. As soon as I sat back down, my migraine attacked again. Whimpering like someone just kicked me in the head, my husband asked the host of the house, if they had some paracetamol for my headache. The lady of the house retrieved some Panadol and I followed her into the kitchen to get a glass of water. I thanked her and she returned back to the family room, leaving me in the kitchen on my own.

From where I was standing, I could see my husband sitting down on his chair. He turned to look at me and smiled. Then appearing behind him, I saw this black figure or shadow-like person, resting one hand on the back of my husband's chair but just standing comfortably as if listening in on our little meeting. I just about dropped the glass, from surprise, I guess. My husband, watching my facial expression, looked behind him, but couldn't see what I could see. This shadow was still standing there, then faded. I drank my water and Panadol, placed the glass into the sink, splashed water onto my face and returned to the family room, sitting down next to my husband.

For the rest of the night, I didn't experience any more headaches or felt as though something or someone else was present in the house.

After we got home that night, I mentioned to my husband what I saw. I told him not to mention it to the young couple since the lady was 4-5 months pregnant. I didn't want to alarm her or her unborn. Could this shadow-like spirit be a past residence of the house? Or the young couple's relative, looking in on them? They haven't experienced anything and the house was blessed soon after they bought it, so, perhaps the spirit just came for a brief visit.

Haunted or Paranoid?,"Ohio, United States",Psychic / Medium,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Psychic / Medium :: Haunted or Paranoid?

I 'm new to this so I will try to explain my story from the beginning as best as I can. I'm 27, I have had some very terrifying things happen during my short time here (being alive) and I think I may be haunted or maybe I'm just paranoid.

For as long as I can remember, I have seen things, images, in the shape of people, but I don't think I've ever seen them directly. It's kind of like I see things out of the corner of my eye. I'll see someone or something pass in the hall way, or if I'm standing in front of a mirror I'll see an image rush by behind me. I also hear a lot of weird noises. (people laughing or talking, when no ones around, foot steps when I'm home by myself or when I know for a fact that my husband and son are asleep).

My family has always been somewhat strange, I grew up watching my mother, and her sisters (my aunts) doing things such as having seances, and going for hikes and walks looking for missing people from our area. Specially if there was a young girl missing which looking back seemed to have happened quite a bit.

Well I remember walking with them looking for ""clues"", like clothes in wooded areas where they had a feeling we'd find things that would relate to someone who was abducted. I remember going deep into some woods close to a school house that had been shut down and we found something like an occult set up. There was a large circle made of branches, and sticks and inside it were bones of animals which appeared to look like maybe sheep or cattle skulls, neither of which are common in our town. We would also occasionally find things like torn clothes, or an abandoned shoe, jewelry (nothing worth much of any thing), just interesting things that leave you're mind wondering what was going on here?

I've always been taught to trust my feelings, my instincts, and I have always felt that I could pick up on things. My mom and aunts would have seances, and have another person usually me or one of my older cousins taking pictures while they prayed, and meditated. We would use Polaroid photos, then when they were finished we would all look threw the pictures to see if there was any activity, and there usually was.

We would see words, and faces of people in the hair of the people in the pictures, and there would be images in things in the background, such as curtains, windows, even images of awkward things on the walls. After words we would see if the images that appeared in the pictures were actually there or if we had just gotten lucky with the photos.

We did these sort of things for years, with none of the images, letters or words adding up to much, except strange feelings like ""I wonder what that means,""and ""this face is so clear I don't know who this person is but I wonder if he had any thing to do with any of the disappearances"".

Anyhow over the past almost 10 years, I found God in my life, and started to believe that the things my family were doing were not right by him, I do not look at my family as being bad people, (although some would say they were playing with the devil using the Ouija boards, and being into things like tarot cards and readings, and other things of that nature). I simply love them for who they are, but chose to follow a different road.

But to this day I see things in pictures, in clouds, in trees. The things I have seen are scary! I see things like deformed faces, creatures or devilish faces, I see letters, and words in any picture I look at.

I love the feelings I get when I watch scary movies, and go to haunted house and read or hear ""ghost stories"". But I also FEEL the presence of perhaps spirits around me. Laughing or talking or walking around me.

My TV will shut off and turn on, as will our stereo in the living room I will hear a key going into my front door, and the sound of the knob turning, No one is there! Physically. And we have 2 cats at home and some times they just go crazy running threw the house like they're being chased and some times they will just stop what ever they're doing and look up at nothing like there is some thing there that we can not see. I like to be scared when I'm with other people the feeling is a definite rush, but when I'm alone its not so good.

I'm just trying to decipher if I may be being haunted or if perhaps I'm just paranoid (and if I'm looking and listening too much for these phenomenon)?

Possible Incubus Encounter at Home,"Tennessee, United States",Old Hags / Night Attacks / Sleep Paralysis,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Old Hags / Night Attacks / Sleep Paralysis :: Possible Incubus Encounter at Home

T his isn't a ghost story, more of a demonic encounter. I swear it is true. It was the night before I started ninth grade and I was asleep, no it wasn't a dream. I got really cold, I woke up and my fan was on, I didn't turn it on. As I started to roll over, my t.v. came on, then shut off. I couldn't move, I was scared stiff, then I felt my bed press down as if someone were stepping onto it. I felt the weight on each side of me, I just closed my eyes. I couldn't breathe, speak, or move...

After what seemed like a minute or so, I was able to roll out of bed. I turned on my lamp, which had a red light bulb in it, and ran, crying hysterically, out of the room. I went to my parent's room and told them what happened, they said, ""oh, it was just a dream, you just thought it was real"".

Of course they wouldn't believe me. The thing that bothered me the most was that a few months before that, my dad had told me his story...

He said that he had just come back from the army and he had an apartment with a friend. He had gone to his parent's house to see them and there was a book on the table. He said that his mom told him that she had caught his younger brother with it and took it away. My dad was interested, so he said he was going to take it. His mother told him not to, we believe she had psychic abilities, but my dad was stubborn and took it anyways.

When he was through looking at the book, he closed it and went to bed. Now, you have to understand that my dad was young and had a few girlfriends, so when this someone or something came into his room, he thought it was one of them.

He was lying in bed and heard someone come into the room and felt them get into bed with him. He didn't know which girl it was, so he just said, ""what are you doing here?"". No reply, he turns over and there is nobody there. He told me that it then got very cold and he couldn't move, he felt someone or something crawl on top of him. He said that he tried to yell for his roommate, but the words wouldn't come out.

After he struggled for a moment, he finally screamed his friend's name. He said that his friend ran in and commented that it was, ""freezing"" in the room. My dad was able to get up, when they went into the kitchen, the book was open to a chapter on demons crawling into bed with people.

I thought that my dad's story was just that, a story, until that happened to me, even though I had had so many experiences, they were all ghosts before this.

If you have any questions, I will try to answer them. My dad has recently passed, so I can't ask him about it, but I can tell you about my experience.

Hospital Fears,Chile,Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: Hospital Fears

I apologize already for my english: since it is not my language, I'll try to do my best to be understandable. My name is Barbara and I am a medical technician in the south of Chile, work that has different meaning in some countries. Let's say my work is having the lab testing done, running the place, and informing the results. I apologize for the large introduction, but it's necessary for you to understand my story - and my predicament.

It is a very isolated job. I work usually with one technician and one auxiliary, and that's it. We lock ourselves in the lab at eight AM and emerged at five PM, and sometimes very very later. In larger hospitals we work by so many as ten to eleven med tech's by lab, but in the little rural hospital I am now, it's just me at charge of everything.

My career began working in large hospitals, but I took some replacements in tiny hospitals (in my country called type 4) and I fell in love with the idea of living in the country, doing that work. So I moved with my cats in a very tiny town in the Lakes area of Chile, and I left the big hospital of Concepcion for the tiny Hospital of Fresia. All went okay for a while: but I have been here 7 months, and I am in deep worry, and maybe desperation.

The place is ideal in many ways: it's quiet, green and low budget-living. I live happily with my pets, made new friends, and enjoyed my work: but there is something that I hadn't been able to shrug off, and it's poisoning my work and general life.

When I was in Conception Hospital, I made night shifts since 8:00 PM to 8:00 AM: alone with a technician, in the Urgency Section of the lab, a great room with all the equipment and lab tables. The room faced a hallway that was parallel to us, going from the main hallway of the floor to the end of the lab, Hematology Section, dark and desert at night. Just across the hallway and facing my Urgency Section, it was the med tech lounge.

It's funny how we grow to know the sounds our equipments made: I was there for almost a year and I could recognize just by the sounds if the equipment was wrong or right. Usually, the Architect(tm) equipment (a biochemical testing automatized machine) made a Prt-prt-prt sound. I was almost lolled by it, my back to it, my left to the door as I was seated in the tall lab stool, checking the results in the computer when my technician made a sound: a half choked sound, like she's swallowed something. I started (she was seating across me) and something moved by my left.

I saw the back of a man, a man purposely strinding the hallway. It was medium height, half bald, and wore a long coat. He was looking front, and vanished in the dark of the hallway. I looked back to my technician, ready to ask who was that guy, and knew something was very bad. She was crying.

I jumped from my chair when I realized nobody has nothing to do in the deserted parts of the lab at 4:00 AM! I don't know if I was going to go chasing or what, I just felt a rush of adrenalin with a strange dizziness, and then the Architect(tm) made a loud, startling PRRIP! My blood coagulator in front went BEEP to, and the room became a pandemonium: I have never seen all equipment went crazy like that. I set off the alarms, and checked them trembling: it was like a low voltage failure, making all the darn things to reinitiate, but they're were wired to different lines! I was yelling ""What was that"" ""Who was that"" ""what is happening"" and my technician stood there simply, not saying a word. I finally realized I've seen a ghost and I felt like fainting, everything was gray and my heart pumped hard.

My technician, and older lady with 40 years in the same hospital sat me, gave me sugared water and told me when I was clearer that was a Doctor who used to be the old manager of the lab, who had died not twenty years ago. And that I was the ONLY ONE of the staff whom never had seen him: other colleagues had seen him regularly, passing to his office, which used to be the Hormones room, next to Hematology

I was scared as hell. I didn't want to cross the hall to GO to the lounge, so I stayed there all night working, even when there was a slow night. At morning I ran home, and waited anxiously for my next night shift. I only commented this with a colleague, who said he had seen the doctor and too a patient in the stair at night shifts, and generally patted me in the head. I was so shaken, that I barely could work at night, and clutched my poor technicians for dear life. I spied the hallway, and finally I managed to forego the issue and got back to more or less my usual self.

Almost three months later, I was working with a different technician when suddenly the Architect(tm) went prt-prt-prt- PRRIP-BAM BAM BAM PRT PRRIP! I almost fell of my chair, panicked: I hade never heard those sounds before, and assumed I've done something terrible wrong. I stopped all functions, and checked the historical for errors: it said temperature error. It was silly, since the temperature  was very mild, not over 22 Celsius, and the equipment worked well to 29 grades. I reinitiated the whole thing, and the I heard a crash. I went to the hallway and checked the Hematology room, Hormones Room and Urines room, and there was nothing: when I was coming back, the light went out.

I was facing the far end of the hallway, my back to the Hormones section. The buzz of refrigerators stopped: I waited for the hospital generators to start. But I felt cold anyway, and the doctor came to my mind, and all I could do not to freak out was to stay there, eyes open, waiting for the light to came back. I didn't even found my voice to call to my technician: seemed like an eternity, then lights came back and I went to the Urgency room not looking back.

My technician was white as a sheet and panting. She told me it was nothing, and I went to restart my equipments. I was proud of myself having been calm, and calming my technician: but several weeks after, I heard she had panicked because she saw the doctor just before the lights went out. Walking down the hall. To the labs I was in!

I was so badly shaken hearing that that I changed my shift that night and it became one, if not the main, reasons I went searching for a new job. I thought later it was stress and enclosement taking its toll in me: locked in the same place for 8 hour shifts, sometimes as many as eight or nine by week, it was only natural I wasn't my usual self. So, I was happy coming to this place, running this little laboratory.

That was until two months ago. I run a tiny Microbiological section, which is no bigger than a closet, really, and sometimes I prefer (preferred) to come back Saturdays or Sundays (my new work is Monday to Friday, 8-5 hours) to transfer a bacteria to accelerate the exam. It is no bother, and it takes only 15 minutes, and can save a day of pain for a patient!

I came back five Saturdays ago to do the transfer. I had just given Internet in my lab, so I was searching the web for some lyrics and pages and I lost track of the hour: when I came out, it was beginning to get dark. The lab has beautiful deep windows that got all the sun all day, but the big Hospital hall, just beyond my door, is very dark and large and tall, each extreme lighted for big stained glass windows converted in offices with more sets of glass windows. There is wooden seating places against some walls, and in the middle the main entrance, closed since 5, and the up-lifted walk to the wards where the patients sleep. Usually is a little red light there from X-ray section, which is left on at night.

I opened the door, turned to close and to let some bags I was carrying at the floor, and I noticed someone in the hall. My first thought was it was somebody cleaning, and after I put on the lock, I turned to say Hi.

There wasn't nobody. I walked there, thinking it may have opened any office and was cleaning into, but there was nobody. I turned round, and peek into some offices, but there was nobody. Then I looked into the Files office room, a room that like Lab, got all the light, and heard a distant pounding. It was the same sound I listen everyday when patients come to my attention window, that character pounding with the nails in glass, but was very faint and I took me a moment to identify it. But I knew I was alone in the Poli Hall.

I sprinted to the wards and spoke to the paramedics there: they confirmed there was nobody down there in the hall. I said nothing more, but boy was I shaked, and went home. I just told to the dentist and the kinesiologist, whom I am friends with, and they laughed at me.

I don't know what to do. Surely can't be EVERY hospital haunted? How can my coworkers joke about it? I feel like I'm going to have a breakdown next thing it happens, and I can't let my fear show in front of patients and coworkers, some of them should come to ME for help.

I wrote to you because not only you seem comfortable with the subject and will not call me crazy, I hope, but could maybe, gave me some advice, just letting this all out it has been a great relief for me. Thank you.

The Ghost In My House,Canada,Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: The Ghost In My House

L ately a lot has been going on in my house. When I say a lot I mean every night... Lately I've been feeling someone watching me at night, after the feeling occurs I start hearing noises... Noises like knocking, ticking, whispers and cold spots.

I was in my room watching TV last week. I have two baby cats that sleep in my room and they often scratch the door at night so I put my coat in front of the door so that they don't make scratch marks on it. I have one of those doors that are really impossible to open unless you turn the knob completely. And I always make sure my door is completely shut because those crazy cats of mine.

So I was watching tv in my room and all a sudden I started to hear my door knob turn. I immediately looked at the door, I thought to myself that its impossible anyone would be coming in my room because it was 3 in the morning (I have bad insomnia). My door knob started to make a lot of noise like someone or something was really trying hard to open it, and then all a sudden my door got pushed open half way and even pushed my coat along with it... Which is impossible because I have a big coat and ""air"" can't just push it across my floor. I stood shocked and just looked at an empty hall... Nobody there.

My cats looked scared and kept freaking out at something in my room it seemed. I closed the door quickly so that they would stay in with me. They for some reason were really trying to get out of my room more than ever now... And kept ""meowing"".

Last night I also heard a women say my name, ""MITCHELLLL"" when I was going to my room, once again it was like 3-4 am.

My dreams are constantly of people trying to communicate with me in my home and ghosts telling me to do EVP but I'm to scared to do EVP, I used to do it, for only a week, and was getting some messages and I don't know if I'm ready to experience anything with them talking to me yet.

Childhood Nightmares,Philippines,Misc,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Misc :: Childhood Nightmares

I 'm not really sure how to start retelling my experiences, and I am a bad story teller, so please bear with me... I'll just type it as best as I could. I grew up in the Philippines and was actually raised in a remote province, I'd rather not mention names of locations right now since I've never really had a positive input from people whenever I tell them ""weird"" stories.

We were raised in this two-story 2 bed 1 bath house, with a storage room just on the left side of the bathroom. I was a very active kid, never really had the time to stop and think about ""ghosts"" so I don't know why I always had dreams about them. I believe it's also important to throw in the fact that all my other siblings lived in the city to go to college and my dad came over here to work so it was just me and my mom in that house.

On to the story. When I was about 5, I would always have these dreams about these people, I felt like they were a family. There was an adult male, adult female, and a little kid. I think it was a boy. I would dream about them maybe 2-3 times a week. It would always start as me coming in from the front door on my way to the kitchen and I would sense something from my parents' room and I would turn around and see the ""family"". They would always come out from my parents' room, their head/face full of blood, and the guy saying, ""Please, help us"". I would always freeze and tell them to go away but they'd just stare at me and he would keep on repeating his plea for help. I would always scream in my dream and that's how it would stop and I'd wake up.

Also, sometimes I would have this dream about me coming in from the front door and I would ""feel"" like something is in the house with me and I would yell ""Show yourself! I know you're there!"" and here comes the family again. Or sometimes there would be this bloody head on the desk where our typewriter was and he would just yell for me to help 'them'.

I'm not even sure if they are classified as ghosts. But those dreams went on for a couple years. What would they want from a kid anyway? I don't think I could've helped them. They just scared the snot out of me, that's for sure.

Life of Terror: Journal of the Haunted,"California, United States",A Haunted Life,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: A Haunted Life :: Life of Terror: Journal of the Haunted

T his story is base on true events that happen to me my sister Casey and my friend Sam. It all started in preschool, my family just move into an apartment in Alameda. The first night when we move in, me and my sister Casey starting to hear music coming from the closet at the same time we hear roller-balding on the ceiling.

A week later there was ants coming out the bathtub, the kitchen wall, and my bedroom closet. On the night of may 1st my dad was out to sea and my mom was working the late shift at McDonalds at midnight me and Casey starting to hear fighting in the hallway, then a scream, at that point we saw two bloody red eyes, we both scream, we where under our covers for the rest of the night.

A year later we move to Concord but they followed. A week later after we move in I heard what sound like crying coming from the attic. That when I knew they follow us. As time goes by there have been flashes of lights, doors slamming, and people getting hurt.

Then one night the night before we move, I look out my bedroom window and I saw a man with a knife, I got up and went to the back yard, there he was but there was something about him that is strange, when I walk towards him he keeps backing up, he back up towards the fence then disappear.

When we move to Oakley in 1999 it was normal at first. Until a year later on, you guess it, may 1st that the day when it all started my best friend Sam was sleeping over when we both hear footsteps in the crawlspace under my apartment.

A year or two years later my sister friend, her nickname big Sam, was helping me with dishes when one of the glass slide across the counter and smash to the floor. That night big Sam and Casey were upstairs and I was downstairs and the power was out. They heard it first then I heard it (it was like heavy boots on hard wood floors but I have carpet).

When we move to Brentwood things turn for the worst. There was banning and scraping on the windows and walls, my computer turn on and off by it self and my bed shake, it got to the point that I couldn't sleep in my own room.

Then last night I couldn't take it anymore I started to bless my room (that where it all started) my light started to flicker, my TV started to go crazy and my computer just went nuts, my bed started to shake, then my room a wind started to blow my papers and my close was flying around my room (like a twister). Then it stops. The heaviness was gone and the fear was gone that when I knew I got my life back. But it not I still got one more ghost left. That start part 2 of my life of terror.

It's been quiet for a year now but on March 20 2007 my birthday at midnight, I was about to fall asleep but something woke me up, I was hearing what sound like knocking on my closet doors. The next day I call my sister, ask her about the knockings she told me ""I forgot to tell you, me and big Sam use the board and we contact a girl that been murder by her ex boyfriend and she hate guys"".

At first I thought that was kind of funny because the thought of a ghost that hate guys. I shouldn't have said that because later that night I was home alone. I was watching Full House and from out of nowhere my backpack hit me in a head. After that my hall lights started to flicker and there was screaming coming from my room so I went to check it out. When I open my bedroom door I got the shock of my life. Things was flying around my room, my TV was going crazy, my computer die. When I look in the mirror I saw a face with 3 knife cuts along the face so I grab my bed stuff and slept in the living room and I still was sleeping in the living room.

June 1st 2007 at school. I was eating lunch when someone or something trip me and my friends was 5 feet away from me I don't know what it was to me I think the girl is a demon.

Later that day in 8th period, everybody was outside, I decided to stay inside to catch up on my work when I saw smoke on top of the door, I ran outside because I thought there was a fire but when the teacher check there was no smoke, no fire. Back outside with the class, we were reading books when something shove me, but my class mates were a good 3 to 4 feet away.

9:45pm I was getting reading for bed so I went to brush my teeth and the door was shut, I got done brushing my teeth and try to open the door but it wouldn't open (it like somebody was holding the door shut) so I gave it a good pull and the door flew open making me fall backe and I hit my head on the sink and I got a bump on my head.

5:00am September I was getting reading for school and my back pack was a mess, I step out to feed the dog, I came back in and my back pack was missing so I was looking for it. When I found it on my bed it was clean out, there was nothing in there except my homework and binder.

10:38pm I was dead asleep when my computer turn on by it self but my computer die 6 month ago. Oct 1 (now this where it get violent) 7:30pm I was in my bed reading my book when my light went out. Then I started to hear moaning coming from under my bed so I bent over to look under my bed. When I saw nothing, I TRY to get up, but I couldn't move, someone or something was holding me down with their foot, when I started to pray it stop, I could get up and my light turn back on.

November 7, 2007 6:11am I was listing to cat country 103 while I'm getting reading for school when the radio started to go crazy, flipping from channel to channel, then it went dead at that point I started to hear scratching on the wall and I hear footsteps coming towards me, the last thing I heard before I ran out of my room was ""get out"".

November 7, 2007 12:38pm I was typing this book when I started to hear knocking on the wall behind the school computer in A104. Now back to my sister Casey who live in Boston, now one night she call and she was freaking out, she told me that she been hearing crashing sound like some one was braking in but when she went to check it out there was no mess, her doll was missing and found it on top of the TV, but it was on her bed in her room.

10pm her time she was talking to me on the phone when we both hear a laugh, we thought it was one of us but a sec later I heard it from my closet.

November 9, 2007 12:08am I just got done using the bathroom and my house was always pitch black, I saw a light coming from my room but my lamp was off and the only light was on is my alarm clock, this light was a lot brighter then my alarm clock. When I open my door there was a big flash, then the light was gone.

5:00am I was awake and I was sending e-mail to my sister when I started to hear talking in my room, so I'm looking around my room trying to find the voices and when I found the source of the voices, it was coming from my dead computer, when I put my right ear to it I got shock really bad (not that bad) as soon as I got shock, the voices stop.

12/5/07 10:00am I'm listing to my brother mp3 player when in the middle of my song I heard what sound like my grandfather saying that he love me and he miss me but he was dead for 3 years.

10:23am I keep seeing this little boy, I think he try to tell me something or warn me about something the last time I saw the boy a twister hit Greensburg Kansas, I think I got a power to see and talk to the dead.

10:32am something went through me and show me how they die. Something tell me it's going to get worse before it gets better.

10:49am I just saw that girl with the 3 knife cuts in her face again through the window to the book room, I'm losing it I don't know how much I could take it anymore.

12/8/07 9:00pm that boy appear to me again I could hear and understand him now, he warn me if I keep trying to find the truth behind the haunting that something really bad might happen to me, then he look at me and told me that she's coming, when I ask who, he disappear.

10:28pm I was setting on my bed trying to contact the boy but something else came through, it was the girl or ""her"", she told me to ""give up you will never free him or the others, they will be trap here forever and you will die trying"" then she disappear. Before I went to bed I put a piece of paper on the chair with a question asking the boy ""who is she and why are you scared of her?"" then I went to bed.

The next morning I check the paper and the boy answer, he said that she was his sister and she hated him and she fight with him a lot but he was still close to his sister. That when he appear to me and that when I ask him how did she die, he told me that she was murder by her ex boyfriend, then I ask him how old was she when she die, he told me she was 19 then he disappear. That when my yearbook flew across my room and almost hit me in the head.

12:00 noon I was eating lunch when I saw in the corner of my eye a girl walking towards my room, so I put down my sub and went to check it out, I saw her leg enter my room and the door shut so I went to open it (WARNING WHAT YOU ABOUT TO READ WILL GIVE YOU A HEART ATACK!) I open the door, that's when a head came flying towards me, then the door slam by it self.

10:45pm I ask the boy to appear and talk to me, he did that, when I ask him how he die he told me that he walk to the creek near my house and drown him self. Then I ask him why, he told me he want to be with his sister (I cry when he told me that.) The last question I ask him, how old was he when he die, he was 15 when he die.

12/10/07 2:33am I got up to get a drink of water, on the way back to my room the whole house went freezing cold, that's when I knew it was ""her"". So I started to run to my room and the hallway was getting longer and longer until I finally I got to my door, when I got into my room the door slam by it self and it started to shake. Then my closet doors started to open and close, my light started to flicker, my movies started to fly off the shelv,e stuff started to fly around. Then there she was staring at me with that evil stare, I stated to back up to get the crucifix from my wall but as soon as I touch it, she disappear.

6:12am I woke up and there was the boy staring at me and he told me that his sister was really mad at me and that she will do anything to stop me from helping him and the others.

12/25/07 I went to take a shower when I started to fell a sharp pain down my body, I look in the mirror and I saw scratches forming on my body. So I got my clothes on and call my friend who is a priest to help me to get rid of ""her""

10:pm we started the exorcism, that's when all hell broke lose, the lights started to flicker, the house started to shake, the screams started to echo through out the house, then the light bulbs exploded, the mirrors exploded, then my friend fainted so I pick him up and started to run, the doors started to slam one by one, then finally we made it outside and we started to pray even more until a bright light burst out of every window and door of my house.

Than the heaviness is gone I'm not scare of my house anymore, my dog is not scare of my house anymore. Is now finally over.

Huddled Together,Australia,Apparitions / Voices / Touches,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Apparitions / Voices / Touches :: Huddled Together

I 'm back again with another experience, its been some time but this one wasn't as spine chilling as my other ones, this one to me seems as if relatives were trying to get my attention. I was deep asleep when my English home work pages were swept to the floor of my homework desk. I didn't want to lose the pages because it was an assignment and I needed it unless I wanted a 0 mark. I picked the pages up and placed them back onto my desk and continued sleeping. My window was closed and my fan wasn't on because it was a cold night.

Then, again, my pages went flying off the desk onto the floor so I picked them up again and placed them on my desk for the second time but something unusual happened when I laid my head back down onto my pillow. I saw a sort of vision of a group of about 3 people huddled together reading my pages and just staring at the work. I turned around and back and they were gone, I knew I wasn't dreaming but I was too tired to act upon it. I went back to sleep and heard something in my ear like from my first story , someone or something said ""they blow off when they read it"". I woke up and my pages were in a neat pile but they were on top of my English file which I keep on my bag, as if someone had already packed them for me, it wasn't scary or anything so I guess its relatives keeping an eye on me, my family is always impressed with my writing, maybe they came to check if the tale was true?

Splashes in the Empty Swimming Pool,United Kingdom,Psychic / Medium,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Psychic / Medium :: Splashes in the Empty Swimming Pool

F irst of all, I need to start with the fact that even though I sort of have a sixth sense, that doesn't mean I know everything about ghosts, spirits or even the future. All I do is sense what is going on in my close friends' and relatives' point of view. So, let's start.

I was at a local swimming pool, just swimming as you can guess and I was enjoying the time with my 10 year old daughter, Kaylee. We were having fun and splashing about. Basically, just having lots of fun in the water.

A couple of hours passed, so everybody had to take a shower and return home, but since Kaylee and I are related to the lifeguard, we have a special pass that allows us to stay until five 'o'clock pm in this particular pool.

I thought that since the adults' pool was empty and it's right next to the juniors', I would have a swim in the deep end as I'm a strong and fast swimmer.

When I swam to the half way point of the deepest column of the adults' pool, I felt a splash on my back and I sensed it wasn't my own splash of my feet popping out of the water because my feet are under the water at all times and that's the reason I can swim fast.

I looked behind and no-one was there, even though I spotted a shadow approximately three meters away from me, showing on the opposite wall I was swimming beside.

I carried on swimming because I thought it was just one of those days when your mind gets all muddled up... But of course... It wasn't.

When I reached the three quarters point, I felt a splash again, but when I looked behind, the water was clear and still and the shadow was gone. I got pretty freaked out so I called Kaylee and said, ""Come on sweety, it's time to go now. You've been here long enough...""

She replied, ""Mum, you promised we'd stay until five 'o'clock and that's still half-an-hour away from now, Please mum...""

""Kaylee, I've changed my mind, we'll come back on Friday,"" I said.

When I got to the showers, I turned the Power shower to the fourth hottest temperature for the shower water. I touched nothing on the showerhead after that. When I turned the shower off and went to dry my hair in the hair-drying section (which is right next to the showers). I have a sixth sense so something told me to suspect that particular shower head I was using. As I was drying my hair, I was trying to concentrate on the shower-head and when I looked away and didn't expect it, the shower-head burst out with water.

I ran to turn it off when I felt that it was freezing-cold water. I looked at the pointer and it was still on the fourth hottest temperature.

I continued to dry my hair in the section behind it so I could try to avoid the spirit that was stirring things up. After I'd finished drying my hair I checked on Kaylee who was still in the shower. I thought I wouldn't walk in because I sensed the spirit wanted ME!

Please comment and try to help me sort out this spirit that wants me!

The Ghost of my Great Grandfather?,"Colorado, United States",Family / Friends Visits,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Family / Friends Visits :: The Ghost of my Great Grandfather?

M y great grandfather was a great man. He was the happiest person I ever met, he loved his family more than anything, valued the worth of $1, was a wonderful artist, and he always put his whole heart into everything he took on. Which I guess is why he felt the need to build his home from the ground up. I wish I could tell you what year it was built, but I honestly have no clue. It was in our family for some time though.

My grandmother and her sisters grew up there, as did my mother, and my brothers and I lived there for the majority of our childhood. It was a beautiful home and a beautiful area. He picked a very historic part of Denver to build the home as well. About two houses down from Molly Browns house actually. (which really has nothing to do with the story. I just thought it was interesting.)

My earliest memories of the home go back to about age 5 or 6. We would visit while my great grandparents were still there. It would always smell like an interesting mixture of cookies and perfume from my great grandmother and my great grandfather would be sitting in his chair sketching a pastel drawing with his fingers stained 10 different shades of blue or red. He would always have the radio tuned to the jazz station and would get up and hum to the song while trying to dance with my great grandmother who would giggle and say ""Oh Joe, stop..."" and sit back down. I seem to be rambling though, I'll get to the story.

I've spoken with my grandmother who had lived there most of her life and her being a big skeptic says she never experienced anything there. Which makes sense considering the house was built from the ground up by my grandfather. Though, when my mother was young that wasn't the case. When she was about 4 she found an ""imaginary"" friend named Tabby, who according to my mother was the cause of all the weird things going on. She slept upstairs in a large room with her cousin. They shared a bathroom together and whenever my mother would get up in the morning to go to the bathroom, the carpet (don't ask me why my grandfather carpeted a bathroom. I don't know.) would be completely soaked. She would go ask Theresa (her cousin) what she did, to find that she was still asleep and claimed to have not gotten up at all.

This went on for years, I'm really not sure if it ever stopped. Though, this could be explained as a simple plumbing problem (perhaps from putting carpet in a bathroom?) She also says she would hear foot steps going up and then back down the stairs late at night when everyone was asleep. They would go up and it would be quiet for a few minutes, and then they would go back down. Just once, almost the same time every night.

The one memory that sticks out in her head the most was one day after school she had a friend over and quickly ran up the stairs just to drop off her school books. She looked at her bed and froze seeing, on the bed and pillow a perfect indentation of a small body and a head lying on her bed. She freaked out and leapt down the stairs and slept on Theresa's side of the room after that. Shortly after my grandparents and mother moved out to California due to my grandfathers work.

Sadly, my great grandfather passed away when I was very young and my great grandmother was taken to a nursing home. My mother, father, brothers and I moved into their home. My brothers took the room upstairs where my mom and her cousin used to sleep, and I was alone downstairs where my great grandmother used to sleep. I distinctly remember one night while having a hard time sleeping I heard what sounded like humming coming from the living room. I went out to check, but nothing was there.

This happened a few other times, usually late at night, usually in the living room, sometimes outside. One of my great grandfathers favorite possessions was this terrible knit tapestry of an owl. It was hideous, he loved it. No one else wanted it, so when he passed we just left it in the house in a closet.

One day when we returned home, this ugly thing was hanging on the door knob of the closet, displayed in the exact place my great grandfather always had it. My mom was convinced it was Grandpa Joe, but my dad refused to believe it. The tapestry went to the basement closet.

As I got older odd things happened less and less. That, or I just didn't pay much attention anymore. Only a few other things stick out.

On weekends I had a habit of trying to stay up as late as possible and falling asleep on the couch. Usually my father would wake up and come down and make me go to my room. This happened one weekend, as usual. I went to bed and thought nothing of it.

The next morning I was talking to my mom, casually mentioned this, and she looked at me like I was insane. I then realized that earlier in the evening the night before my brothers and dad had gone camping for the weekend. It was a distinct male voice that I heard telling me to go to bed. At this point my mom was so used to it she just said, ""Oh, it was grandpa Joe...""

As I grew older I blossomed into my artistic skills. I was working on a project for art class and getting incredibly irritated that it wasn't turning out the way I wanted it. In a fit of frustration I threw the drawing into the garbage and left the house to go to a friends house.

A few hours later when I returned home there was the drawing, sitting right in the center of my bed. No one else had been home to move it, at least that I'm aware of. My mother of course says this was my great grandfather, the artist telling me not to give up.

Shortly after this, sadly, my great grandmother passed away in the nursing home. It was a week or so later that we began smelling that cookie/perfume mixture in the house. It would move from room to room usually going back to my room, but was always very prominent when you walked in the door.

The last incident I recall was on Christmas. It became a tradition in my home for my parents to turn Christmas music on Christmas Eve and leave it playing all night and into Christmas Day. This particular Christmas we woke up and instead of Christmas music playing, it was the old time type jazz that my great grandfather listened to all the time. The tuner on the radio was set to the same station it was left on, which was always just Christmas music every year. We couldn't figure out why the station would just change their format all of the sudden. After about half an hour or so, it changed back to the standard Christmas format.

After that we all grew up a little, and my parents started going through a separation which inevitably ended up in them selling the house. There was a lot of fighting going on in the house, and I suspect if my great grandparents were there the fighting made them very uncomfortable, so they may have left.

We never had another encounter after that. After the incidents my mom became fascinated with the paranormal and visited a psychic one day. The psychic described her ""imaginary"" friend Tabby perfectly and even knew her name. Could it be that some of the things we thought were my great grandfather were really Tabby? And the things that happened before his death, like the indentation of a body of a child on my mom's bed, were those Tabby? My mom also says quite often she has incredibly vivid dreams of the house. She can actually feel the cold hard wood of the stairs on her feet. She's even speculated that maybe she is haunting the people currently living there because of how real her dreams feel.

Is it possible that some other little girl in the home is hearing footsteps up and down the stairs late at night? Is it possible that those feet belong to my mother who is just dreaming and crossed some sort of astral plane or something? My mother certainly thinks that's the case. And if that is true, then, in retrospect, could that have been the situation the first time around? When we were living in the home and experiencing bizarre things. I have no idea about these things

From Happy Bride to Nervous Wreck,United Kingdom,Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: From Happy Bride to Nervous Wreck

G etting the keys for our new home was so exciting. The flat was in a beautiful Victorian house in Bayswater, London W2. With its high ceiling with cornice, sashed windows that was about 3 meters high and it still had the servants bell. I was planning what I was going to do as soon as I took the keys. Firstly... I was going to clean the flat, then I was going to prepare our first meal as man and wife.

With keys in hand, I kissed my husband goodbye as he had to work that night. The flat was only round the corner from his work, which was handy. I went into the flat. Looked around and saw what needed to be done. I set to work cleaning. The flat was too quiet, so I put on a record from my record collection. I was so happy to be in the flat even though I was cleaning.

Just the small bedroom to finish. I was singing away to the song that I knew so well...""Linda,"" I heard someone call me. ""I'm in here,"" I shouted back thinking it was my husband... ""Linda,"" I heard it again... ""I'm in here,"" I said once more. ""Linda,"" I heard for the third time. That's Ibrahim I thought to myself. He is messing about. I started to look for him laughing to myself. I went into the bedroom, checked in the wardrobes and under the bed... no-one there.

I went into the bathroom, looked behind the shower curtain... Still no-one there. I went into the lounge where the stereo was playing. I got the shock of my life... From the record that I knew so well it said my name again. I screamed and grabbed my coat. I ran around to my husband with my slippers on.

He thought I was crazy when I told him about what happened. That was the start of lots of unexplained strange goings on in that flat.

Another time, I was in the bedroom and I had the stereo on again which was playing in the lounge. All of a sudden, the music turned off. I thought that the power had gone off so I checked the light but that was working. So I went in to check the stereo. I noticed that the switch on the wall was up which meant it had been turned off. I was the only person in the flat at that time.

My sister-in-law was visiting with her husband. They were staying in the small bedroom at the front of the flat. She was in the bedroom and her husband was in the shower. She had the stereo on which was on the radio mode. All of a sudden, the radio switched to a german radio station and it was on the highest volume. She went in to turn it down and she found the turn table spinning around.

Another time, I was asleep in bed in the afternoon. I found my friend standing over me. I asked her, ""How did you get in here?"" She said, ""You opened the door..."" I said, ""How could I have opened the door if you have just woken me up?"" ""When I rang the door-bell, you said, ""Who is it?"" and I said, ""It's me, Jackie,"" she said. ""And then the door opened,"" she added. I told her, ""Maybe you've rang the wrong doorbell and they have let you in,"" I replied. She said, ""I'll check with the neighbours if they've let anybody in..."" She had asked them and they told her that nobody had rang their door-bell.

When I was 4 months pregnant, my husband was asleep next to me in the bed, and I was thinking about my new baby and finding it hard to sleep. Next thing I knew, the bed started to bang on the wall. 'bump' bump' 'bump'. It sounded like a heartbeat. I nudged my husband and to wake him up and told him that the bed was moving. He lay there and said, ""Oh my God, I can feel it!"" It wasn't scary, just unexplained.

Ever since we'd moved in, we'd had lights going on and off, footsteps in the passageway when nobody was there, etc.

A friend of my husband's arrived at one o'clock am to stay with us for a few days. We had all went to bed as soon as we arrived as we had work the next morning. Ibrahim asked me to bring his friend some lunch as he couldn't be with his friend as he was working. When I brought him the lunch, he said to me, ""Linda, this place is haunted..."" He left that day with no explanation as to what had happened to him.

Another friend of ours came around to stay the night. He had to sleep in the lounge on the sofa. He told me the next morning that he had to sleep with the light on all night as he heard somebody walking around the couch. When he had looked, as you can guess, nobody was there.

Another Holiday Experience,"Nebraska, United States",Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: Another Holiday Experience

I t was early New Years Eve, evening with the twilight shining on the snow. I sat at the window of the apartment staring out at the cold and snow. It was freezing and the roads were very icy. I heard the television drone on in the back ground imploring all the celebrating and partying to be careful as the roads would continue to get worse; more snow was on the way. Joy of joys. I was bored with winter already and it was only turning January.

I crossed the room and switched off the television. My mom had gone to friends of hers for a poker party. Some friends and she were planning on playing all night. I was sincerely hoping she had fun. She and my dad had not been split up for long and she needed some fun. My sister was at a friend's for the night and since my dad had forgotten to pick me up, I would be home alone. Oh, well. I would turn on the stereo, eat junk food and read. All of my favorite teen age past times.

As I crossed the tiny living room from turning off the television to the stereo, the lights flickered. Normally, with the wind and snow this would not bother me, but there had been so many strange occurrences in this apartment that I stopped in my tracks. I was shaking all over. I looked briefly around the room telling myself to knock it off, it was the weather! Just the same, I decided I would put candles and the battery operated radio on the table in front of me while I had my junk food fest. I went into my room and grabbed a few candles and my book.

As I came back around the corner to go back into the living room, I saw THAT hand again! The weathered hand from my last story! It was curled around the wall as if going into the living room. The hand was brushing against the corner of the was as if the being it was attached to had just gone around the corner. I stopped, stopped breathing, stopped walking, and stopped everything! I was terrified. I started to back up into my room and I heard this laughter. It was like it was coming from all around me, as if it was on a speaker system or something to project sound. It was not loud, but it was not a whisper. It was very, very cold. The very sound chilled me to my core!

I backed into my room and continued to stare towards the living room. I could not see into the living room as it was around the corner. I could only see a small portion of the walls. As I watched, shadows began to move across the wall. These shadows were the reflective type given off by someone moving around in the room. I continued to stare, transfixed to the spot. There was very little noise in the apartment. The only thing I could hear was a swishing sound, like fabric rubbing together; it was coming from the living room.

Finally, something inside of me woke up and I started thinking, ""Wake up dummy! Don't just stand here! Call someone!"" I backed up to my telephone all the while watching the shadows on the wall and hearing the occasional swish of clothing. I called the first number that came to mind. It was a guy I had been dating on and off for a few months, we were more friends than anything. He answered after about the fourth ring. All I could get out of my mouth was to squeak, ""Please come and get me, now!"" He was saying ""Kim, are you all right? Where are you? I said ""Home! Hurry!"" He said he was on his way and I hung up the phone, all the while watching the shadows.

All at once I heard the laugh again, all around me and felt a bone chilling cold pass through me, after that it was like a weight had lifted from the air. I looked over to the walls again and there were no shadows, there was no swishing noise, nothing. And, as I said, everything just felt lighter and airy.

Although I somehow knew that it had left, I couldn't move. I was still so terrified. I stood there near the phone for what seemed like an hour but must have been about 5 minutes.

Head lights appeared in the drive way and shone through the curtains. I heard a car door slam, and then a knock at the door. My friend was at the door. Thank God! I threw open the door and ran outside, no shoes on, no coat. I was crying and hugging him and trying to explain all at the same time. He kept telling me to calm down and was ushering me back into the apartment. We sat down on the couch and he asked what happened. He told me he brought a couple friends with him in case I was in trouble, they were in the car. I asked him to have them come in and would they stay for a while and watch a movie or something. He said they would.

I told him I was going to get some dry socks, I would be right back. As I entered my room, I heard the front door open and close. He had gone outside to get his friends. No problem. They would be right in. I sat on the edge of my bed and pulled of my wet socks and rubbed my freezing feet. I heard a slight scrapping noise and looked up. In the corner of the hall way, there she stood! The same piercing blue eyes and pointed teeth! Starring at me and smiling. She appeared to be, again, about 7 feet off the ground. She was wearing grey. All grey. It appeared to be like an old bath robe that came all the way down to were her feet would be and was cinched loosely at the waist with a belt. Her teeth were as if made to be at a point and it was ALL of her teeth. There was no evidence of decay or anything visible, and with the way she was leering at me they were visible. Her vivid blue eyes were cold, almost as if you were to fall into a freezing lake and be able to see the top but not get there. I kept feeling that way, drowning almost when I stared back at her. There was no wind or breeze, but her steel grey hair looked like it was being blown back from her sallow face.

I screamed as loud and long as I ever have. My friend came running through the front door along with two of his friends. The came bounding into the bed room. I opened my eyes and she was no longer there. I was crying pretty much hysterically at this time.

The next thing I remember is being in my friends old Pontiac squished in the front seat between him and one of his friends. They kept asking me what had happened. I just kept shaking my head and crying. We got about four blocks from my apartment, heading to the house where my mom was playing cards as we came close to a four way stop.

The roads were indeed icy as was earlier predicted so my friend began slowing for the stop sigh quite a ways. I heard one of the guys in back say ""Why would anyone be walking on a night like this, especially an older person, they could fall and hurt themselves"".

I looked up and there in the center of the cross walk was the thing! All gray and misty looking. She turned and stared and smiled. Everyone in the car gasped at once, like sucked in their breath. She continued to look at us, grinning and crossed the street, and then she appeared to be gone. One of the guys asked if we had all seen her disappear. All of the others reasoned it was the heavy snow playing tricks on the eyes. They felt that was the reason she appeared misty in the cross walk and she now was poof, gone!

The rest of the ride to be with my mom is a blur. The next day when we went home back to the apartment, our friend had made it clear she had returned that evening.

The Hidden Cellar,United Kingdom,Psychic / Medium,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Psychic / Medium :: The Hidden Cellar

T his story doesn't involve me - in fact, the occurrence happened thirty or so years ago when my Mom was young. It was she who told me the story, and here I am relating it here. My aunt Nonny and her new husband had decided that living with the parents simply wasn't appropriate anymore, considering she had six siblings and that three of them were young enough to still live at home, so she went out house hunting, as you do. When she went to go and see this one particular house, though, she took my Mom along with her, to get her out of the house and get some fresh air.

So, my Mom went with her and her husband to this relatively old house, and almost immediately she could tell something was off. Really off.

She described it as though there was something hateful in the house, glaring at them and hating them, and as though something terrible had happened there. She was shivering and absolutely petrified for no apparent reason, and really wanted to get out of there. Nonny, ever the pragmatist, told her to pull herself together and get over herself.

Despite these words of advice, Mom couldn't ignore the feeling that she was trapped and continued to be in this state of utter terror. For some reason, she was convinced that there was something very, very wrong, and it was in the cellar. One tiny little problem - there was no cellar. Still, she kept on that there was a cellar there, and that the door was behind the bookcase. Mom had no idea why she knew this, but she was desperate to open the cellar door and equally as desperate to run for the hills and never set foot in the house again.

Nonny, embarrassed and exasperated with her sister's behaviour (as anyone would be when faced with a sibling about to go into hysterics over an unsubstantiated feeling), somehow managed to convince the estate agent to move the bookcase aside to prove there was nothing there. This bookcase, may I add, was one of those heavy, old-fashioned ones, or so she says, and it took both the estate agent and Nonny's husband to shift it. And, to everyone's surprise, there was a door.

The door was prised open, and mom immediately felt a release, as though there had been something trapped in there and now it had been set free. She describes it as though it was a gust of wind or a release of pressure in the air. The estate agent was amazed (and probably a little creeped out) because he had no record of there being a door there, and certainly no record of a cellar.

They thanked the estate agent for his time, and left. Nonny never did buy that house, instead choosing a nice, normal flat she'd found earlier. She never let us talk about it either, saying it was nonsense and Mom simply had a lucky guess.

Later research on Mom's part showed that there had been something terrible happen there, that a family had been locked up in there and after they'd been freed by the police they'd sealed the cellar away. Whilst they didn't die, I expect the emotions, the fear they experienced, must have left an impression in the cellar that my Mom felt and responded to. But that's speculation on my part.

Scary Cyclist,United Kingdom,Apparitions / Voices / Touches,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Apparitions / Voices / Touches :: Scary Cyclist

W e were driving from our home near Witham, Essex traveling to Ipswich where my daughter was training as a nurse. My wife was also with me in the car. It was getting near dusk but visibility was good. As we were traveling down a hill on a dual carriageway near the Essex/Suffolk border, there suddenly appeared a cyclist traveling towards us in the outside lane coming towards us going the wrong way. This cyclist was dressed in Edwardian clothes with a long dress and straw hat. She was riding a sit-up-and-beg type of ancient bicycle with a basket on the front.

This apparition was seen by my wife and my daughter. We were traveling at about 50 mph and had no time to take evasive action as the cyclist flashed past the offside of the car. There was no collision thankfully and we were all a bit shocked. The strange thing is that there were no slip roads anywhere near whereby the cyclist could have got onto the road and anyway why would anyone in their right mind want to cycle the wrong way down a fast road? We looked behind us expecting to see the cyclist disappearing up the road but there was nothing to be seen. It occurred to us that there might be a spirit haunting this particular place, perhaps the result of an accident which occurred when the road was just a single track before it was widened and dualled.

Corner Shadow,"Virginia, United States",Old Hags / Night Attacks / Sleep Paralysis,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Old Hags / Night Attacks / Sleep Paralysis :: Corner Shadow

T ry to bear with me, this is the first time I've really talked about this. The sequencing might be a little messy. Lets see, I've had experiences all through my life. Nothing really that stood out, or terrified me though until within the last few years. The experience that I'm about to describe is by far the most terrifying that I've had to date. This happened in my junior year of high school I believe.

Things started to happen a couple of months before. I started to get sleep paralysis and things would vibrate my bed at night. During my states of sleep paralysis I could hear someone/something walking around my room. I talked to my brother about this because he has studied the paranormal and knows a little bit. He opened up the idea that it could be that I was astral projecting and that I was actually walking around my room, and that the sleep paralysis was caused because I was not in my body and was woken up before I could get back in.

After he gave me this theory I pretty much just chalked it all up to that and never really thought about it. The one thing that still bothered me though was that my bed would vibrate. These things happened on and off for a couple of months and eventually stopped.

Then, one night, between the hours of 1am and 2am I would say, I was woken out of a deep sleep and could not move. I could not move because I was so terrified. There was this dark, dark figure in the far corner of my room just staring at me. I could feel its eyes just staring. It just felt so evil. I was so terrified I couldn't move, I couldn't talk, I could barely breathe. All I could think to do was to pray. After what felt like an eternity it eventually went away.

I haven't had that experience again, but while I was living in Lynchburg I did have a feeling of being watched and I had something call my name.

I was just wondering if anyone could give me some insight, or some ideas to what y'all think this could be. Any theories would be much appreciated.

I Saw my Grandpa,"Florida, United States",Family / Friends Visits,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Family / Friends Visits :: I Saw my Grandpa

W hen I was about 3 or 4, I can't remember, but my grandpa had passed. I can't really remember him, except for pictures I saw. Well at his funeral, I was standing and waving over into the corner, probably behind where the casket was, in the front row maybe. My mom asked me, why are you waving? And I supposedly replied, I see papa over there! He is waving at me. My mom was not scared and probably not surprised either. Too bad I can't remember it, I would loved to have seen him!

Well, since that was a short story, I will tell you my next encounter. I remember this clearly. I was maybe 7 or 8 and was sleeping over at my dads house. In my room there I had a bunk bed.

One night, I was sleeping lightly, when I heard my bedroom door open, for I had beads or something hanging off of the handle. Well I thought maybe it was my sister or dad, so I turned around and there was a girl. She looked like my sister since it was dark and I was half asleep, but I looked closer and she had dark eyes, and pale skin. Also, cuts on her face and shoulders. Before I had realized that, when I still thought it was my sister, I tried to grab for her because she wasn't moving and I was thinking huh? But when I realized, I froze, and dived under my sheets, terror stricken. I stayed under there for maybe a couple hours, and was sweating so bad I had to come and get air.

Previous times, when I got scared or something and was under my sheets, I would think I saw a silhouette (however that's spelled) of a hand, but I believe I imagined that, but still scary! My dads house wasn't haunted I believe, maybe she was just passing through, I have no idea, but my dad passed when I was 10 and we have renters living in his house now. I wonder if they've seen anything? I will have more stories later!

Anne & the Others,Canada,Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: Anne & the Others

W hen I had my first ghost experience, I was around the age of 7 or 8. I woke up about 7 am at that time. So one regular morning, I woke up, and looked out of my bedroom which faced the hall. To my surprise, I saw a woman in what seemed like a long white dress run into the washroom. I closed my eyes, and tried to fall back to sleep, not as scared as I thought I would've been. About a week later, I was brushing my teeth, and I looked into the washroom mirror. Guess who I saw? The same woman. That was the last time I saw her.

One of the most well-known spirits in my house is a girl around 7-ish. I believe her name is Anne, although I'm not sure. It's just one of those feelings. The first time I saw her was when I was in grade 5. I used to wake up in the middle of the night and go into the living room where my mother slept. She stood up, to make room for me, and I saw a little girl peeking out from behind her. She stood there for a while, just staring at me before I blinked and she disappeared.

The next time I saw here was last year, in grade 8. I saw her walk from my sister's room (my old room) into the washroom. I don't know why, but I didn't seem as terrified of her as I thought I might be. I saw her again this year, walking from my bed to a bookshelf I have, and again walking around my bed. I haven't seen her lately. But, I told my mother, and she was quite surprised. She told me a few years back, she saw the same girl, in the same clothing I saw her in. A white dress, with a bonnet. She looked from around the 18th century. When my mom saw her, she was leaning over my bed, staring at me. The other time, this year, she peeked out of the kitchen door when my mom walked in, and dashed back quickly.

Another ghost is a soldier. I've only seen him a couple times. Once I was sitting at my computer, and I saw him clearly walk behind me, and when I looked where he was, he wasn't there anymore. Another time, he was walking by my bookshelf. I heard the shuffling and everything, and he walked behind me. I thought it was my dad, trying to see what I was doing, but I saw him instead.

A few times, I've seen a white figure. It usually just peeked at me, and hid shyly when I looked at it. I haven't seen it at all in a while.

One time, I was sitting at my computer, and I felt something tickle me, and touch my face, etc. It put it's hands over mine, like trying to hold them, and it touched my feet and everything. But whenever my dad came around, it would go away, until my dad left, when it would start again. And I'd feel an extremely friendly presence, but it would be overtaken by an evil feeling presence, then come back, and tickle me again, etc.

My Nona used to have a cat named Princess. I was really close to him. (Yes, him not her.) I was really sad when he died, though I was just in Senior Kindergarten. Just this year, for the first time, I think I saw his ghost. I saw a white cat walk into a room I was sitting in. Thinking it was her other white cat, Snowball, I looked over to pet him. When I looked at him, he continued walking for a second or two, then disappeared. Another time, I saw him jump behind a chair, which he always did, and when I looked for him, I couldn't find him.

Last Monday, (March 10, 2008) I got a Ouija Board from my grandmother because she knew I wanted one. My cousins wanted to try it out with me, so a few of us went into a supposedly haunted room in the basement, and I did a prayer, and a protection ceremony-type thing, then we tried to talk. The planchette didn't move, and my cousins were getting paranoid and scared. We forgot to say goodbye, because they were so freaked out, and just jetted out, even though nothing happened.

Ever since then, I've been seeing a figure walking around, usually around me, and I don't get a good feeling around it. I would like to know if anyone can tell me what to do? And I plan to use the Ouija Board in my house, but with experienced, safe people. What do you all think?

I forgot to add before, sometimes when I'm in bed, I'll feel like someone's on the other side of me, and I'll be way too terrified to even look that way, but at other times, there seems to be a friendly presence, and I can look the way I feel it.

Also, one time, I woke up at 3 am with a nosebleed, then at 6, with a nosebleed, then at 9, with the same thing. Throughout that day, when I'd walk in certain areas of my house, my head would throb, and my back would have sharp pains, but when I walked somewhere else, I'd be fine.

I will check my comments as much as possible, and try to participate. Thanks =)

Writings on my Skin,Canada,Psychic / Medium,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Psychic / Medium :: Writings on my Skin

E ver since I was a baby I have been able to see, smell, hear and sense any ghosts and or spirits around me, while growing up I had never been harmed by them or afraid of them for that matter, but once I moved into my new house with my family, things stared to get really weird, like things flying around, tapping on walls and aquariums, cabinets slamming, water running and the smell of wood on fire and I just decided to ignore it because I truly believed that a ghost or spirit was not able to harm you.

But one morning I woke up to a burn mark on my inner elbow area of my arm with cut that seemed to shape like the letter ""T"", I had ignored it and figured maybe I hurt myself accidentally because I have a tendency to sleep walk and I am a smoker.

After a day or two I realized that I could not have been smoking or walking in my sleep because my grandfather is up at all hours of the night and he would have definitely noticed. But since then I have been getting more cuts and they are all shaped in letters. First it was a ""T"" then it was a lower case ""i"" and I also have a ""L"". I'm not sure what it is trying to do but I think it is trying to tell me something.

If anyone has any idea on what might be going on please contact me and if I figure out what is trying to be spelt I will update this and you are welcome to read. I just wish he or she would get me to write it on paper in my sleep. It scared me though because each cut seems to be getting deeper.

Mama's Helper,"Indiana, United States",Family / Friends Visits,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Family / Friends Visits :: Mama's Helper

M y Mama is a strong woman. She has gone through so much in her life that she has examples and warnings for just about every situation that anyone goes through. She just doesn't like to share all of her experiences. She says that some people just have to learn through the experience, and not from someone else's.

She always tries to help out us kids. All five of us. I have two step sisters (and one nephew) and one step brother. She loves them as much as she loves my brother and me, even if they don't live with us. She has fought for them, even when their Mama didn't see the need to.

Mama hardly ever asks for help, but here recently she did. While we were having dinner one night she explained that she would be working long hours and would like it if we could help with some of the housework for a few weeks. Of course we all said we would, but when it came down to it, she would come home and still have a lot of the work to do. We can't do the job as well as Mama, guess that's why she's the Mama.

Mama had to go through a few boxes that were left after my Papa passed away in November. She kept putting it off saying that she didn't want his ending to be final. Maybe she thought if the boxes were still there, so would Papa.

She sent us into the family room to watch television, telling me that she just needed some time to go through some things. That was strange as she never sends us to watch television. She would rather us read books, or play games. I needed something so I went to her bedroom door.

She was sitting on her bed with a box on her left and crying. That scared me, cause she never cries. I know she had a hard time with my Papa's death, she was holding his hand when he went and even passed out when the guys with the bag came in the house to get him. So I stayed where I was and watched her. I did not know what to do. She tilted her head to the right and kind of whispered ""what?"" and I watched the right corner of her bed sink in. All I really remember hearing her say was that she needed help, and she could not do this all on her own.

Mama sat on her bed and talked to someone for a while and then she tilted her chin up, and took a deep breath just like she always tells us to do when we need to regroup. She wiped her tears away, smiled and said ""Thank you, I needed you"" and put the box away.

I ran away from the door. I didn't want her to know I saw anything. I think she sees and hears things that she does not want us to know about, and gets a lot of help from the other side.

I Helped Him Pass Over,"Texas, United States",Psychic / Medium,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Psychic / Medium :: I Helped Him Pass Over

H ey guys! I am back! Last night was like the biggest and happiest moment ever! Remember Rubert? Well if you don't here's his info. Rubert is 6 years old, a shadow child, and before he crossed over he wanted to see his mother. Also he is a poltergeist.

I was in the chat room when someone came into there! Her name is Michelle and she is HauteCouture, of course I asked her first if I may use her name and she didn't mind. Me and Michelle chatted for a bit then I told her about Rubert and my theory, of his mother being in Heaven, or the light for those of you who are non religious.

She told me to tell him to go into the light. So I said, ""Rubert? Do you want to see your mom? Do you really want to see mommy? I believe she's in heaven waiting for you. Go up to the light Rubert, you'll see her! I promise..."" I said that as gently and as caring. I had a headache but the headache wasn't so bad, until it became horrible. It felt like something was tearing in half in there! I'm clairaudient so, I think it was our connected thoughts that were being disconnected.

Then it felt like a bit more air was coming around me, like someone just left. And after a minute or two I felt as if a burden was lifted. Well, I think I was bearing Rubert's burden also. I felt happy, excited, and wonderful! I haven't felt a pinch or poke since last night. Or heard a stomp. So I really think he left! I have helped others cross over, but I didn't really know them... So this was different! I couldn't wait until I could share this story with you guys! Thank you Michelle for the help!

Shadows and TV Changing Channels,"Texas, United States",Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: Shadows and TV Changing Channels

E very time I come downstairs to get on the the computer I feel like I am being watched. Sometimes when someone's staring at you, you can feel it, well that's how that felt like. One morning I woke up and I saw a face, I got scared, so I closed my eyes again and I saw nothing.

When I was brushing my teeth, one morning I thought I saw a black shadow so I screamed and my mom came, she asked what happened. I said I saw a black shadow, and as parents always say ""its your imagination"", I told her that it wasn't my imagination but she said it was my shadow, but I saw it about two times.

Last night I thought I saw something behind my couch so I got really scared and ran up stairs, I fell asleep real quick and last nigh I had a nightmare and this morning my blanket was over my head and it felt like I couldn't breath.

Also, last night I was in my older sisters room, the hallway lights were off, all of them were, and so I pressed guide on the remote, I was looking and I wasn't pressing any buttons and it changed the channel to the fresh prince of belair. Then I changed it to Drake and josh and it changed again so I stared, hugging my dog and freaking out, and then my mom came in and we told her, but she said its just a timer. I just don't know if it was just my grandpa.

Thank you for reading my stories, if you have explanation please tell me.

Startling Knocks At My Window,"South Carolina, United States",Misc,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Misc :: Startling Knocks At My Window

I have a habit of being awake in the wee hours of the morning on a fairly regular basis. This particular morning I was up late working on some music projects. I had my earbuds in listening to a track when suddenly I heard 3 loud rapid knocks right at the window behind my bed's headboard.

It scared the living s#!+ out of me! Startled, I snatched out my earbuds and laid low for a brief moment wondering who in the h*! Could be knocking on my window at this time of the morning. This has never happened before so I'm there ducked down trying to process what just happened.

In those brief moments my mind is racing and I thought for a second could it have been one of my household relatives that went outside and perhaps locked themselves out? Then I thought could it be someone from around the neighborhood up to no good or perhaps needing something?

Then I thought that maybe I was hearing things, but the knocking was LOUD and I actually felt the THUD of the window. That's actually what got my attention, and it was loud enough that I heard it beyond my earbuds.

I quickly jumped out of bed and grabbed my pistol. I then slowly peeped out the blinds of the window to see if anyone was out there but oddly there was no one there.

That side of the house is well lit by a nearby street light and my car was right there next to that window. Still peeping out the window I looked around the car and waited to see if maybe someone was hiding behind it on the other side, but I didn't see anyone. I angled my gaze downward to see if anyone might have ducked down below the window alongside the house but no one was in sight.

I then went out of my bedroom and slowly peaked around the corner into the front room to see if by chance anyone else was awake and happened to make a loud noise which I thought was at the window, but came from another part of the house instead. However, I saw that they were all sound asleep, snoring loudly.

I then peaked out the blinds in the front room (where my relatives were sleeping) to look out in the yard but I saw no one in the yard. If someone were to flee it would've took them a few minutes to get far enough to exit the yard, and they would've been well in view of the street light.

I went back in my bedroom and looked at the clock on my laptop. I saw it was 2:48, right before 3am (which is said to be ""Witching Hour""). At this point I'm on edge and starting to think that it may have been something paranormal happening.

For the sake of protection I burned some sage and told whatever it was to leave me alone and return where it came from.

I laid back down in bed on edge for the remainder of the morning until daybreak, but nothing else ever did happen.

The following night came and I again, was awake in the wee hours. Naturally I was on edge waiting for something to happen again but nothing ever did.

Rumor Or Real?,Japan,Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: Rumor Or Real?

T here is a small Japanese-style washoku restaurant I sometimes go to. It is an old place with a wooden sign and a sliding door. Inside the floor is covered with tatami, the tables are low, and the smell of grilled fish and dashi hangs in the air. The menu is fixed, with set meals of rice, miso soup, simmered vegetables, pickles, and fish.

People in the neighborhood have spoken about the place for years. They say that if you stay there too late, unusual things begin to happen. I never believed it until one night I went there with my friend.

It was close to closing time. The dining room was empty except for us. The waitress came to take our orders, bowed politely, and walked quickly down the corridor toward the kitchen. Her footsteps echoed unnaturally against the floor.

While we waited, the light above our table flickered. We both looked up, then shrugged it off. A few minutes later, a clatter broke the silence. A pair of chopsticks had fallen onto the tatami from the table next to ours. The strange thing was that no one had been sitting there.

Not long after, I felt a tap on my shoulder. It was light, like the touch of a waiter. I turned, but no one was there. When I looked forward again, the waitress was just then coming out of the kitchen, carrying our trays with both hands.

We ate quietly. The food was the same as always, but the silence of the room pressed down on us. After the last orders were served, the kitchen lights went out. I heard the faint sound of pans being stacked, and then there was nothing.

Suddenly a loud crash echoed from the kitchen. A pan had fallen to the floor. No one moved and no one spoke. The kitchen remained dark.

When the waitress returned with the bill, she said nothing about it. She bowed as usual, but I noticed her hand shaking slightly.

We paid quickly and left. As the sliding door closed behind us, the light above the entrance flickered once.

Later I tried to learn more about the rumors. I discovered that about fifty years ago, the owner of the restaurant had a violent quarrel with his wife. He struck her, not realizing she was pregnant. The baby was lost. The woman's mind gave way after that. Some time later she killed him in the restaurant's kitchen.

It is said that the man still lingers in the dining room, and the woman remains in the kitchen, waiting for the one who took her child.

When I think back to the tap on my shoulder and the chopsticks falling from the empty table, I cannot help wondering which one of them it was...

"Did They Fade, Or Do They Remain?",Japan,Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: Did They Fade, Or Do They Remain?

I live in Hokkaido, and my yard used to have an old well. It had been there long before I moved in, tucked away behind shrubs and an aging shed. I rarely used it, maybe only only once in a while for watering plants? But otherwise it sat quietly, almost forgotten.

The area where I live has long had a reputation for being haunted. Over the years I've grown used to it. Sometimes, in the middle of the night, faint voices can be heard, like distant prayers carried on the wind. They've weakened as time has passed, and I've come to accept them as part of the atmosphere here.

But what happened when I arranged to close the well felt entirely different.

In the days leading up to the ceremony, strange things began to occur. At night, dogs from far-off homes barked and howled in the direction of my property, though there was nothing visible in the yard. Inside my own house, I would wake to muffled knocking sounds, low and insistent, as though coming from beneath the ground.

The night before the priest was due to arrive, I saw something I still can't explain. At dusk, I noticed a shape near the well. At first it looked like an animal crouched close to the ground, but as I focused on it, the form seemed to stretch upward, taking on the blurred outline of a person. It never came into focus... Always shadowy, indistinct... Before vanishing altogether. When I went to check, the ground around the stones was damp, though it hadn't rained in days.

On the morning of the ceremony, the air in the yard felt unusually heavy, as though the place itself was holding its breath. The priest performed the purification, but later admitted it had been harder than usual, as if something resisted the prayers.

When the ritual was finished and the well was sealed, the disturbances ceased. The dogs grew quiet, the knocking sounds never returned, and I haven't seen that shadowy figure again.

Even so, the memory lingers. The distant prayers that sometimes drift through my area feel familiar now, almost harmless. But the things I experienced during the well-closing were different... Very active, immediate, and unsettling in a way I won't soon forget.

Do you think the spirits tied to the well are still here, or did they fade away like the voices of those midnight prayers?

A Haunted Well,India,Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: A Haunted Well

"" This is something that happened to my mother around 45 - 50 years ago...""

During her childhood, my mother used to spend her summer holidays in a small village called Naginenipally, at her eldest sister-in-law's house. Like most children of her age, she was playful, curious, and a little adventurous.

In that village, there was an old well that everyone whispered about. The elders often warned children to stay away from it, saying it was haunted. Naturally, this only fueled the curiosity of the kids.

One day, when all the elders were busy with work, my mother and her close friend slipped away to see the well for themselves. They played around it for some time. Neither of them knew how to swim, so they never dared to get too close. But then something terrifying happened.

Out of nowhere, a woman draped in a black saree appeared. She was carrying burning coal wrapped in her saree, yet the cloth did not catch fire. With a swift motion, she threw the burning coal in front of the children. Shocked and terrified, the two girls ran back to the house, trembling with fear.

Days later, despite the incident, their curiosity got the better of them. They returned to the well. But this time, what they experienced was even more chilling.

From deep inside the well, they began to hear a voice calling out the name of my mother's friend. At first faint, it grew louder and louder, echoing through the air until it felt unbearably close.

The girls fled in horror. That very night, my mother's friend developed a high fever. Even as she lay in her home, she claimed to hear the same voice calling her name again and again.

Though her fever eventually subsided, she never recovered from the fear. Within a few days... She passed away.

I Would Have Been Late,Canada,Family / Friends Visits,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Family / Friends Visits :: I Would Have Been Late

M y Mother passed away in April 2022, though I have been thinking to share the interesting events that happened around that trying time, today I'm going to write about a little help she gave me this morning.

Today I had to go to work to a place a bit far from where I live and one of my coworkers was to pick me up at 6:00 AM.

Since this is way too early for the time I usually get up, I decided to sleep in my daughter's bedroom so not to disturb my husband's sleep. I prepared my stuff and a good lunch and set the alarm with enough time to let me get ready, have a good breakfast and tend to the cat's needs before leaving, I thought one hour and 20 minutes would be enough time to do everything without rushing.

Anyway, at some point I had a dream, perhaps even a nightmare, in which I was going to get together with my friends from university, they arrived at my place and I wasn't ready. I began looking for something to wear but couldn't find anything suitable, mismatched socks, flowery blouses and plaid skirts and homely dresses that would had made me look like a pauper beside my elegantly dressed friends.

I went out and told my friends that I'd be ready in two minutes, but was moving with the speed of a snail and knew I would make everyone else late for whatever event we were attending.

My parents were watching me from the background, and Mom said ""Se te va a hacer tarde"" (You are going to be late).

Hearing her voice was enough to wake me up startled, I checked my phone, it was 4:23 AM, still a bit earlier than the time I had set the alarm. I stayed few more minutes in bed but decided to turn off the alarm and get up. To my horror, I realized that I had set the alarm at 5:40 AM instead of 4:40 as I had intended!

Strange Voices In The Mountains,Japan,Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: Strange Voices In The Mountains

I went camping for two nights at a small site up in the mountains, next to a slow-moving stream. The water ran clear over stones, and deer wandered through the area occasionally, which is normal in Hokkaido. The air smelled damp and earthy, with a faint hint of pine.

I rode up on my side-car. The road was quiet, and the forest on either side felt still, but the ride itself was normal.

The first night was uneventful. I heard only the stream, the occasional rustle of leaves, and a few distant birds.

The second night was different. I woke sometime after midnight because the forest felt unusually still. The stream was quieter, and then I heard voices.

At first, they were faint, blending with the water. But it was clear they were human voices, not animal sounds. One voice, soft and high-pitched, sounded like a woman speaking in short, broken phrases. It drifted slowly through the area, fading in and out. I stayed still and listened. After a few minutes, the voices faded completely, leaving only the stream.

When I was leaving the next morning, I mentioned it to the caretaker. He didn't look surprised. He said quietly that people sometimes hear things in that part of the mountain, and that in the past, a few people have gone missing there. He didn't give any details, and I didn't ask.

I don't know what I heard that night. Maybe it was someone lost, maybe it was just the way sound carries in the forest. But the voices by the stream have stayed with me. What do you think those voices are? Are they victims or some sort of night creatures?

"Move To San Francisco, A Very Haunted City","California, United States",Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: Move To San Francisco, A Very Haunted City

O oookay, I was totally joking at the end of my last post when I said I'd post again in five years. But here it is, five years later. Looks like I'm going to be unintentionally posting every five years on here.

On 29 June 2021, I moved to San Francisco. It's where I'd always wanted to move, but couldn't for various reasons. Well, a really good friend of mine told me that I could live with them. They lived with their family and their family said I could stay until the end of the year, then I'd have to find my own place. That seemed perfectly fair.

In 2017, their grandmother passed away. I always assumed she passed away in the hospital because I remembered my friend telling me they rushed her to the hospital, and a few days later they told me she passed. But every time I was by the bathroom in front of her old room, I'd get this strange feeling there was a presence. That little hallway had that feeling. It didn't feel evil or scary, it actually felt calming. I told my friend, and they said, ""That's Baachan. She's watching over us"". My friend is Japanese and that's the term they call their grandmother. I asked if she passed in the hospital like I thought, and they said, ""No, she hated it there. We brought her home to rest in her own bed, and she passed away that night"".

However, the basement was another story. Or rather... First floor? Basements are weird here in San Francisco. In their house and the one I'm currently living, there are steps leading to second floor, which acts as the first floor. The ground floor is considered a basement even though it's fully above ground. I've lived here four years, and I'm still confused by it. I live on the third floor but it's technically the second floor...

Anyway, we had to go to the basement to do laundry. We never liked being down there because the air felt thick and evil. My friend's family had bought the house back in the 1950s and their mother had grown up in it, and she told me it was like that when she was a little girl. She hated being down there and doesn't go down there unless she has to. I asked if something happened down there and she said if it did it was before her family bought the house, but it definitely feels like some really bad energy is down there.

So, I got a job there, saved up and moved into my current house on 5 January 2022. I'm renting a room in a house, and it's a really nice neighbourhood in the Richmond. That's not doxing myself, the Richmond is fifty blocks long and like ten blocks wide. It's a very big area.

It didn't take me long to notice that the house was haunted. At least the hallway. Even in the daytime I feel like something is chasing me when I walk down it and I rush back to my room. A friend of mine looked up this address on SF Chronicles archives and found out there had been a murder here in the '80s. There weren't any specific details like if it was in the top floor hallway or something. But that's the only thing we found that could explain it.

There are four rooms on my floor. My room is at the end of the hall facing the outside. I look out my window and see the street. The room next to mine, there was someone living there when I moved out. He moved out a year into me living here and someone else moved in, he's still here. The room at the end of the hall, the same person has lived there since before I moved in. I mention all this to talk about the last room. I call it the middle room even though there are four rooms. I guess it'd be the middle room in that hall, since mine is at the end of the hall. Anyway, I've always called it the cursed room. The guy who was living there when I moved in moved out a month later. In the three and a half years I've lived in this house, we've had six different people move in and out. The short time was two weeks. I came home from work and he was moving his stuff out. I asked what was going on and he just said, ""I can't do this anymore"". I asked what he meant and he just repeated it. The current tenant there seems to be paranoid. When he moved in a couple months ago, he told me that he had to move out of his last place because his landlord was having the tenants spy on him. I was like, ""Oh, that's messed up!"". But then he started talking about hidden cameras in his room and I felt like maybe his last landlord didn't have him spied on. A couple weeks ago I was coming up the stairs from taking out the trash. His room is directly in front of the stairs, and as I was nearing the top, he opened his door and told me I needed to stop standing outside his door listening in. I was confused and he said, ""Don't bother denying it, I caught you three times"". The other way I was coming up the stairs from talking with a friend at the front door who had come to pick up something. As I was nearing the top he threw open his door and startled me. I laughed and told him he startled me. He goes, ""I told you to stay out of my room! You need to leave me alone!"". Honestly, I don't know if that has anything to do with the activity here or if he's just mentally ill, but I honestly wouldn't be surprised if there was a presence outside his room and he thinks it's one of us.

Something happened a couple of days ago that made me want to write all this down. Our bathroom is split between two rooms. Okay, from my room looking down the hall, on the left side are my roommates' rooms. On the left side is an empty closet, the stairs, and the two bathroom doors, and the kitchen at the end of the hall. The first bathroom is literally just the toilet, the size of a porta-potty. Really tiny. The second door is the shower and sink. It sounds inconvenient, but with four people living there, it's been very convenient. Anyway, a couple days ago I was in the first bathroom and I could hear someone taking a shower. I could see the light on, and the windows were open and I could very clearly hear the shower going. I was thinking to myself, ""I'll just wash my hands in the kitchen"", like we usually do in that situation. Well, I leave the bathroom, the sound still going and light still on through the window, and when I close the door behind me... The second bathroom door is open, and the light is off and no one is in there. No shower going, the floor and walls are dry. I stood there, my blood frozen. It was seriously eerie.

Okay, that's enough about my living haunting situations. I'll talk about my San Francisco working haunting situations. That's a weird wording, but I'm going to keep it.

First job I got was on Fisherman's Wharf at a souvenir shop standing outside going, ""Everything is $10!"". That was literally my entire job. That's the job that paid for me to move out of my friend's house. But a week after I moved into this house, the store abruptly closed. I frantically looked for another one and was lucky enough to find one with one day left in the month. My landlord is very understanding. It was an organic market on Polk, and I loved it there. A lot of the friends I have made here were either coworkers there or regular customers there. A minor celebrity was a regular there and she and I talked every week. It was so much fun working there! Even if it was haunted like crazy! There was the obvious stuff like stuff falling off shelves that weren't near the edge, stuff moving around or not where we left them. There were times we saw figures cross between aisles even though we knew no one else was in the store. I even had a similar experience that happened in Ohio. A coworker and I were discussing the hauntings, and a loaf of bread flew off the shelf and hit the counter. We decided to change the subject. The same thing happened in Ohio except it was a bag of chips.

In 2023 the store was bought by another, bigger store and closed down and we were all let go. I had saved up thousands of dollars by then, which was lucky because that paid my rent until I got another job in March 2024. My current job, in fact. I'm a photographer at a landmark. Obviously not going to say which one. We take pictures of guests as they enter and try to sell them souvenir sets of their photos as they leave. We all know the area is haunted, but it's hard to prove because we're outside. We just know mostly because we can feel it. There were two incidents that really solidified it, though. Several months ago, I opened up (I'm a lead there) and when I unlocked the office there were photo cards everywhere. I called the person who closed the night before and asked them what the heck happened. He was completely confused; it wasn't like that when he left. I knew he was lying so I had to report it to my district manager. An hour later she texted me a video showing that... It wasn't him. Oh, the photo cards are cards with QR codes we scan when we take the pictures and hand to the guests. There are 1,000 in each box. Anyway, there was an open box on the table in the office and in the middle of the night, they started flying out of the box of their own accord. I asked her if I could share the video and she said absolutely not. What's with corporate not wanting these things getting out? Honestly, I think that'd give us more visitors.

The other thing that happened was we often hear our names called from behind the sales area. There will be no one over there and one of us will hear our name being called from back there. No one else can hear it, but almost all of us have heard it. Even the skeptical ones have heard it, though they have tried to dismiss it as the wind. But it even happens when the wind isn't blowing, or even no breeze. The air could be still and we'll still hear it. It's always eerie. I've been working there for a year and a half and have heard it many times and am not used to it. We had a sixteen-year-old girl start working there last year. I was standing next to her on her first night and she suddenly screamed. I jumped and asked what happened. She said, ""I heard someone saying my name!"" and she ran behind the sales area and screamed again because no one was back there. I involuntarily laughed and said, ""Oh, you'll get used to that"", even though like I said I'm still not used to it. Needless to say, she quit after about a week. She said it was because she hated working outside, though.

I'm going to end this by talking about something nobody likes talking about. I've walked the Golden Gate Bridge so many times now that I don't even take pictures every time anymore. It's just a large bridge that just happens to be one of the most famous in the world. No big deal. But as I'm sure everyone knows, it's well-known for the unfortunately high number of people who have jumped off of it over the course of its existence. I don't know if you've walked on it, but you can definitely feel it when you're walking on it. There's an air of sadness when you're walking across it. No matter what I'm doing, be it listening to happy music or in a call with my best friend, there's an unmistakable feeling of sadness, dread, and regret when walking on that bridge. I've never specifically seen anything, but I think it's because I'm kind of sensitive to that sort of thing that I feel it so much. I've walked it with a friend of mine once who isn't sensitive to the paranormal and she didn't feel anything. Heck, at this point, I don't even know if what I feel on the bridge is even paranormal anymore. There's been so many jumpers over the past century, those emotions are essentially baked in by now. They have nets in place now so there have been less attempts lately. Someone did jump a couple months ago. I saw him lying on the net refusing help. Last I saw, they were guiding him off. So, the nets are definitely saving lives. Either as a deterrent or by literally catching people who try.

Is Someone Visiting?,"Texas, United States",Family / Friends Visits,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Family / Friends Visits :: Is Someone Visiting?

I t has been a VERY LONG time since I have visited YGS and had someone not reached out to me via FB I am not sure I would have returned, but here I am and a BIG thank you to the individual who reached out to me.

2024 was not a good year for myself or Family. In January we saw the passing of my Mother. Her health had been in decline (heart issues) and was in assisted living in the Dallas Tx area. In May we received the 'midnight' phone call that wakes you from your peace. My Oldest Son (Lawrence) had collapsed at work, he worked 3rd shift (overnights) at a Local Floor and Decor, and was pronounced dead at the scene. He had suffered a Bi-lateral pulmonary embolism. My Father -in-Law, who's health was failing (Type 1 Diabetes Complications) moved in us in June, by the first week of August he was placed on Home Hospice and passed away later that same month (yes, he passed in my house).

In the year since, some 'odd' things have happened either to individuals in the household or with-in the house itself.

1st: When home alone I hear someone moving upstairs in my Son's old room. I 'played' it off as it being our dog (a 13-14 year old 50-60 pound Huskey with a bad hip) only to realize he was at my feet as I sat on the couch. A quick 'cat check' shows that both of out cats are also in the living room with me.

2nd: Each Family member has felt Lawrence's presence at one time or another, up to and including hearing his voice saying something... Not sure if this is just us remembering how he would speak with us or if he is actually interacting with us still, but it's defiantly his 'sarcastic' / snarky type comments.

3rd: Not sure how people feel about seeing individuals that have crossed over in their dreams, but my Wife has had two very vivid dreams about Lawrence, she describes them as 'feeling' real. The first one he was comforting her because he had passed away, he assured her that 'he was needed' on the other side... The next day is when we received the coroner's report detailing what had caused his death... A pulmonary embolism, is enough to take someone, he had suffered a Bi-Lateral (one in both Lungs) Pulmonary Embolism and there was nothing that could have been done to prevent it. The other dream she described was 'just as real' but he was simply comforting her, at least that's all she could remember about it.

So, there it is... 2024 was a very rough year for our Family, still dealing with so, so many things from last year, but making progress. Thanks for reading.

Am I Losing The Plot?,United Kingdom,Misc,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Misc :: Am I Losing The Plot?

A t the end of May this year, I lost my umbrella. This fact had me very confused as I do not use my umbrella very much, and usually use it to walk to the gym when it's raining. Just as info, I have zero psychic ability. None. But I have been reading stories on YGS for over 10 years as I find the subject interesting.

I looked everywhere for this umbrella. I live in a Victorian terrace with limited space so there are a finite number of places to look. I even went to my car and checked in there. On the back seat of my car, behind the driver, I keep two cloth shopping bags and I moved them out of the way to look at the back seat (even though I can't imagine why I would put it on the back seat) but I saw nothing. Each week these 2 bags would be used and returned to the same spot. Shortly before I was due to go on holiday the 3rd week of June, I returned my bags to the back seat and there sat my umbrella. I was quite nonplussed. I was sure that I had carefully looked at the back seat weeks before. I park as close to my front door as I am able because parking is first come first served.

I got back from my holiday, and on June 3rd I was making something to eat, and reached into a lower cupboard for a can of baked beans. I always have baked beans - they are a staple. My hand grabbed air. I bent down to have a look, stuck my hand into the space where there should have been cans, put my arm all the way to the back and zilch. No beans. I was really surprised that I had run out as I hate running out of anything. Next day when I did some shopping I bought a couple of cans to go in the cupboard. When I tried to insert the new cans I heard a clink. I looked into the cupboard and there were two cans of beans there. As you can imagine, I was beginning to wonder if I was losing the plot.

On the 10th of July (and this is where I went back and wrote dates down) I took a bus to meet someone for coffee in a town about 3 miles away. While I was on the bus I looked at my hands and noticed that I had not put on my rings and bangle. A few months ago I realized that I really should wear my jewelery more as it was silly to leave it in the jewelry box, so I had two rings resized and started wearing them more. The only problem is that at times the rings and bangle get really annoying. When home, I often put them on my computer desk and put them on from there before I go out. If they annoy me when I am out I pull them off, and slip them into the front zip pocket of my shoulder bag. I thought about when I had last seen the jewelry and could not remember seeing the pieces by the pc before I left, so I thought that perhaps I had forgotten to take them out of my handbag after the last time I wore them. I unzipped the front pouch, which is probably about 25cm x 20cm, slid my hand back and forth and resolved to look for the rings and bangle when I got home as the pocket was empty. Had my coffee, got on the bus to go home and started to put my bus pass into the front zip pocket. As soon as I slipped my hand in, I felt my bangle which is gold and fairly heavy and noticeable, and the rings were there too.

After the beans incident I had started to wonder if I had a spirit in my home with me, and the jewelry incident really reinforced that thought except for one thing. I was a couple of miles from home when I found the empty pocket, and about 3 miles away from home when I could feel my stuff again. And this is where I really started to wonder if I was losing it. How did ""my"" spirit know that I would be looking for my jewelry on the bus, and how did it put it back in for me when I was not at home? Can these entities move around with you?

I have been meaning to set up an account here, but I am a great procrastinator. Yesterday I was sitting in my recliner for a few minutes before going out. I had been ready to post everything after I set up an account, but I procrastinated for a couple of weeks, and then yesterday something new happened. I leave my Kindle Fire on the arm of my recliner. It was unplugged and to my left while I checked something out before leaving. I looked over and it turned on. Now, if there is no power plugged in, I must hold the power button to a 5 count before it turns on, so somebody was trying to be helpful, which it would have been if not for the fact I was going out.

I am of an age where quite a few people have Alzheimers and/or dementia, and I really would rather not join that group, so if someone with more knowledge than me would care to comment on the question of can spirits follow you around locally, I would be relieved if some do and that I am still sane.

A Shadow In The Forest,Japan,Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: A Shadow In The Forest

I have lived in Hokkaido for ten years. A few days before the event, I visited Nibutani, a village where the Ainu people preserve their culture and traditions. An elder told me about Ke-saru, a spirit said to live deep in the forest and watch those who enter.

He explained,""Ke-saru doesn't chase people, but it watches carefully. If someone is careless or disrespectful, it takes more than just fear.""

The name Ke-saru means""face peeler""in the Ainu language, referring to the spirit's dangerous nature toward those who show arrogance or disrespect in the forest.

Before I left, the elder taught me a prayer to say if I ever felt the spirit nearby,""Kamuy ceppesuy."" This means,""Spirit, please return to your home."" The Ainu believe that spirits called kamuy live in all parts of nature, animals, plants, rivers, and the wind.

While hiking alone in the Hidaka Mountains, the air suddenly became cold. All birds singing, wind rustling leaves stopped completely. Then, I saw a dark shape moving slowly between the trees. It was too large and moved too quietly to be a bear or any animal I know around.

At that moment, I felt a heavy pressure and had difficulty breathing. Remembering the elder's words, I whispered the prayer,""Kamuy ceppesuy.""

For several seconds, the Shadow stayed still before silently disappearing into the darkness.

When I returned to Nibutani and told the elder what happened, he said, ""It saw you. You are lucky it let you go.""

Since then, I have avoided walking alone in that part of the forest. The silence and shadows are not just empty, they feel like something is watching.

Did I encounter the Ke-saru or can anyone explain what happened?

Spirits From Ripley's,"Florida, United States",Ghost Tours & Haunted Hotels,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Ghost Tours & Haunted Hotels :: Spirits From Ripley's

R ipley's Believe It Or Not seems to have more than just artifacts from different locations around the world. Some seem to be there from the Paranormal Realm, which I had the opportunity to investigate and experience.

Just like at the Old Jail, you go through a little bit of an introduction, a run over of the gear that they have to let you use, then you are released to investigate the building. I was not expecting all the activity that we had the opportunity to witness, and it definitely itched the scratch of wanting to get some interactions to see if there was paranormal activity.

This location gave more EVP evidence than anything else. Which part of it was receiving the name Steve a few times. Then there was a time frame where it said ""switch"", which I was there with a friend, and asked if it wanted me to hand the spirit box to my friend, which we received the response ""yes"" and it then proceeded to whistle at him a few times.

At this location, we were not receiving very many spirit orbs, but was a lot more heavy on the Voice Phenomena when we were asking questions. Now the one time that I had some concern was mentioning that I was going to go downstairs, and got a very heavy, deep, angry sounding NO! Response through the spirit box, which, much to say, I did not go downstairs at that point.

Then towards the end of the investigation, we were standing in one of the exhibits and received the response ""Die"" or ""Will Die"" and at that point my buddy as well as myself were like, nope we are stepping out of this room and going elsewhere.

Either way, that was my first investigation before doing the Old Jail investigation and hope that you guys enjoyed reading this.

Ghosts Of The Old Jail,"Florida, United States",Ghost Tours & Haunted Hotels,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Ghost Tours & Haunted Hotels :: Ghosts Of The Old Jail

I figured I would share a story of one of the experiences that I have had in my life, that I feel like was the most interesting encounters that I have had to this day.

A friend and myself had gone to St. Augustine in Florida, and while there, noticed that the old jail had these paranormal investigations that you could pay to go on at night. Now to start it out, they didn't give too long in there. If I remember correctly you would be allowed to investigate on your own, but after receiving a short introduction and a quick run through of the equipment that they would let you use while there. All together I think we were allowed like 30-45 minutes for the investigation after all the intro and run through with the equipment was done.

But this was my second time doing an investigation, and the whole time they were doing the introductions outside, I could feel some eyes on me from inside the old jail. I remember it was the second floor off to the left side as you look at the Old Jail from outside. Then when we walked inside, we were able to get our hands on some equipment and investigate.

So we started out in the kitchen, and were not really receiving anything there, and proceeded to move over to the cells and see what was out there. Which we didn't really receive anything there, and proceeded to go to the Solitary Confinement Cells. That is where the real stuff kicked off. We didn't capture any EVP's but we did receive spirit orbs (which I had caught on camera) and there was a point when I captured the sounds of feet shuffling on camera.

Now with that, we kept getting spirit orbs every time when we would mention the sheriff, and then we went up to where the sheriff lived when he was over the prison, and caught more spirit orbs as well. When we were checking around in there, I had stepped to the side and received a tug on my shirt, which kind of startled me.

That was one of two investigations that was done in St. Augustine and will be writing the story of the other investigation that we had done, and would love to share that story with you guys as well. Also in regards to the story, if there is interest in seeing the video footage from the old jail, I have those uploaded on my YouTube channel, and can share that link with those that are interested in it.

"Visiting Shaft No. 4, An Old Coal Mine In Hokkaido",Japan,Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: Visiting Shaft No. 4, An Old Coal Mine In Hokkaido

I recently visited an old coal mine near Yubari called Shaft No. 4. It closed many years ago and is now abandoned.

The rusty gate at the entrance was cut open. I took a flashlight and walked inside. The air was cooler and damp, smelling like earth and rust. The tunnel walls were rough stone, and my flashlight only lit a small part ahead.

It was very quiet except for my footsteps. After a while, the air got colder. I could see my breath even though it wasn't cold outside. Then I heard some soft tapping sounds coming from deeper in the tunnel where I couldn't see.

The tapping didn't sound natural. It was like someone walking carefully. I stopped and listened, but the tapping stopped after a few seconds. It felt like something might have been there, just out of sight.

After that, I thought I heard faint whispers, but I couldn't make out any words. It was a quiet sound, and it felt like a warning to leave.

A sudden chill ran through me, and I felt uneasy. When I turned to head back, I saw a shadow move quickly along the wall. I shined my flashlight there, but there was nothing. The darkness seemed deeper than before.

Outside, the sun was setting, but the cold feeling and quietness stayed with me. The usual sounds felt far away.

Even now, I think about that visit. It feels like the miners who worked and died there left a presence behind, a quiet feeling in the cold tunnels.

Visiting abandoned mines can be dangerous. The tunnels may collapse, and the air might be poor. If you go, bring a friend, wear boots and a helmet, carry a flashlight with extra batteries, and tell someone where you're going. Be careful and respect the place and its history.

Yubari was once a busy coal mining town from the early 1900s to the 1960s. Mining was difficult work, and many miners lost their lives underground. When coal demand dropped, the mines closed, and towns like Yubari became empty.

Visiting Shaft No. 4 connects me to that history. It also reminds me that some memories don't fully go away even in dark tunnels.

Encounter Of A Spirit Of A Spider?,Japan,Pets / Animals,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Pets / Animals :: Encounter Of A Spirit Of A Spider?

I had a dream. In it, I was in my hobby room where I keep all my tarantulas. Everything looked exactly the same as in real life, the shelves, the lighting, the soft hum of the air, the subtle warmth. It felt ordinary. But the silence carried a strange weight.

That's when I saw my oldest tarantula. The one who had passed some time ago. She didn't move, but somehow, her thoughts reached into me.

And yet I knew exactly who she meant. The Singaporean Blue. A beautiful spider I had planned to ship out the next morning.

In the dream, I didn't question how I knew, it just made sense. Her message didn't need to be spoken aloud.

I wanted to respond, but I knew I couldn't. Even within the dream, I understood this was a one-way message. I was only meant to receive.

When I woke up, sunlight filled the room. My packaging table was ready, the materials laid out neatly. I was supposed to ship the Singaporean Blue that very day. But the dream lingered.

And there she was. Curled gently around an egg sac. Quietly guarding it, protecting it.

If I had shipped her that day, the eggs might've been lost. She might have been harmed. I cancelled the shipment immediately and called my friend to explain. Thankfully, he understood.

I'm not claiming it was a ghost or something supernatural. But the dream gave me something I had no way of knowing. It changed what I did.

So if something speaks to you in a dream, gives you a message you couldn't have known otherwise, and alters your path, doesn't that make it an encounter? I don't know for sure. But I'm grateful I listened.

Hug Goodbye,Australia,Family / Friends Visits,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Family / Friends Visits :: Hug Goodbye

Y esterday an old friend of the family passed away. V didn't want anyone visiting toward the end, only her immediate family. I wanted so badly to spend more time with her but I respected her wishes.

About a year ago I knew something was wrong with her; it was a gut feeling and nothing more. As the months went by I dreamt about her a lot. In most of these dreams I'm standing on the road outside her house. I know I can't get in and I don't try. They're sad dreams. In one dream I find a path beside one of the front gates. I enter through this path, it leads me to their house. But the house isn't there, it's like it was never built and I can't find my way out again. All dreams are in daylight.

I never asked V if she was okay or if she was ill. A part of me knew not to and another part of me didn't want to know. She's never been the best when it comes to doctors and conversations relating to medical topics always fall flat.

About ten years ago V had another medical scare but came out without a scratch. With little to no medical treatment. She really thought she'd live forever and so did everyone else if we're honest.

Last night I was at home tidying up. While I was dusting a desk I felt V suddenly behind me. It was such a strong feeling and I could see her in my mind stood behind me. I didn't turn around but I said her name and the feeling got stronger still. I could see clearly in my mind how she was standing, what she was wearing, how her hair was styled, everything. In my mind I could see her touching my shoulders in a half hug, way you do when you're comforting someone. When V touched my shoulders there was such an intense unmistakable feeling of her being right there. After a moment I shook the feeling off and walked away because I didn't want this to be what I believed it to be. Wish I hadn't done that.

Last night I kept dreaming of V. Just random stuff like sitting in their kitchen chatting, their dogs being rowdy. One dream was of one of her lampshades which she made for me when I was a wee lass. I have it sitting out ready for an old lamp that needs rewiring.

Today I got the call that she had passed away. I don't know what time it happened, only that it happened yesterday.

While I was on the phone the call kept going into static sounds. At one point the phone beeped a long kind of 'beep' sound. Never heard my phone make that noise. I was talking to my dad, who informed me. The paranormal is a no go topic for him so I didn't bring it up, not sure if he heard anything on his end.

I know it sounds cliché but V's always been an inspiration to me. In that she's always been unapologetically herself. Her passion for antique everything was completely unmatched and her home was the most haunted place I've ever known. I wrote about their ghosties years ago on here. The eccentric couple with the big ole posh place.

V was born into extreme wealth but was a hippy and artist at heart. Never worked a day in her life. Dedicated much of her time to helping others. She was so generous with people, often times to her own detriment. She would often have people in need live with her, usually recovering addicts. Which was often dangerous as V and her husband are big into recreational substances. It usually ended badly, very badly. V was beaten up a few times by some of the people she took in. Her heart was always in the right place but she could be very naive.

I don't think it's completely sunk in yet. I thought writing about last night would make me feel something but I'm kind of just numb.

On a slightly unrelated note about a year ago I was watching a horror on Netflix. In this movie someone holds a duck out from around a doorway or around a corner or something. It's a white duck and someone holds it out so it's like looking at you from the doorway. It's a silly quirky scene but it scared the bejesus out of me. For anyone who may remember, when I wrote about V's place years ago I wrote about a duck puppet that stuck its head around the doorway when we were kids. I thought V's daughter had done this and ran towards the puppet but nothing was there. So, did someone from Netflix read that or what?

The Haunting Of Willows Apartments,"Nebraska, United States",Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: The Haunting Of Willows Apartments

I 'm here to talk about my experiences as a kid in the Willows Apartments. I'm not sure why no one talks about them much, but that place is hell.

When I was just 9-10 years old, I had a very bad experience and very negative. My mom had stayed here when we moved in, I knew something was badly off. I started noticing it when mom would get angry more and easier. I knew being a single parent was bad enough and ever since I was a kid, I'm a magnet for spirits and demonic entities. It's terrifying when you're just a kid.

It started off when moms' emotions would increase, the smallest things could set her off. I could understand why maybe it was stress until... That quickly changed. Started to hear footsteps at night, knockings, slamming kitchen cabinets would wake me up. I thought it was mom, but I would get up and to find her always fast asleep.

One day a childhood friend of mine came to stay the night little did I know that was the last night we stayed there; we encountered evil. My friend and I were in the bedroom playing with toys, when all the sudden I saw a shadow dark run across the wall. I pointed at it and asking her did you see that she looked at me in fear like she saw the whole thing not just a shadow. I screamed for my mom, tears down my face, ""I saw it! I saw a shadow!""

My mom saw my fear and felt it. She contacted her close friend and we cleansed what we could of out apartment and never looked back.

Later that week mom found out that the buildings were built on very bad Indian burial ground, many deaths followed, and the apartments continue to haunt the living to this day.

Unexpected Messages From Loved Ones,"Georgia, United States",Photographs / Videos / EVP,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Photographs / Videos / EVP :: Unexpected Messages From Loved Ones

I t's been a longtime away from the site, just busy but I'm now officially an empty nester and had some extra time to catch up with you all here.

I wanted to document two recent instances of EVPs that just happened unexpectedly, plus something related to the empty nester thing.

First, I was videoing some birds gathering in a tree in my back yard in early spring. They were making a ton of noise eating on the berries and I thought to send the video to my husband at work so walked out to record them. On the way back inside, as it was cold, I yet again didn't tap the off button properly to turn off the video recording (I'm so bad with my phone) so ended up with footage of the birds and the ground as I was walking back inside. But upon playback, as I'm crossing the patio, one can hear a fairly obvious EVP of a voice saying, ""OOH RAH,"" which is what U.S. Marines say... All the dang time. My late husband Scott was a Marine (as is my current husband). If current husband had been in the house, I might conclude the voice was his, but this morning he was already AT WORK. I can't imagine any of my elderly neighbors hollering like a Marine, so I'm left thinking it was Scott, yet again finding a way to be heard on a random day. He died from brain cancer in 1993 at age 32.

Then, last week, went to visit family graves at the cemetery where my aunt was recently interred. Scott's plot is just across the small interior street from my mom's. You can stand at mom's grave and see his and vice versa. Anyway, I decided to record as I walked up, because last time I was there I got an EVP. This visit, a woman's voice on video says, ""It's a woman"" as I'm walking to the gravesite. I stand there a minute and look over to Scott's grave and pretty sure there was a tear falling as I walked back down a slight hill to my car. The same woman's voice says, ""It's ok"" on my video recording. Easily heard, much appreciated.

Finally, Mom had given me a silver bracelet at the time of her diagnoses with cancer in 2013. I'm not much for jewelry, but I wore this bracelet every day. Sometime at the beginning of the covid lockdown, I lost it. Obviously not going anywhere, but it just sort of disappeared and over the last four years I've looked everywhere and yes, it did cross my mind that it was significantly from my mom.

Well, I have four kids and the last of them graduated from high school this spring. I've been raising kids 36 years and am 64 now, so it's going to be great as these last two finish college and join their siblings in adulthood. We had a large graduation party and that day I went into the closet where Mom's china (she left me) is kept to get a platter. I had to move a silver gravy boat out of the way to get to it and guess what just happened to be in the gravy boat? Right -- Mom's silver bracelet! Found on the day of the last kid's graduation, an occasion I know Mom would've loved. There is NO reason for that bracelet to have been there these last four years! I can't help but think it was yet another message from Mom.

The Cry In The Tunnel,China,Ghost Tours & Haunted Hotels,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Ghost Tours & Haunted Hotels :: The Cry In The Tunnel

A few years ago, I visited Harbin during the coldest part of winter.

The city was covered in deep snow, and the air was sharp and dry.

Walking through the streets, everything felt quiet and still - a kind of stillness that comes with extreme cold.

I had come as a tourist, interested in both the city's architecture and its history.

One site in particular stood out on the map: the Unit 731 Museum.

Unit 731 was a former covert military facility operated by the Imperial Japanese Army during World War II.

It served as a research base for biological warfare. Inside, human experiments were conducted (studies on frostbite, intentional infection with disease, and live vivisections.)

Thousands of people, many of them civilians and prisoners of war, died as a result.

The lighting is dim, and many areas of the building have been left in their original condition.

The displays include photos, documents, and preserved medical tools.

At one point, a guide pointed to a stairway leading underground and said,

""That tunnel leads to the prisoner cells. You may go down alone if you'd like.""

The tunnel was narrow, the walls damp. The air was colder than above.

Water dripped steadily from the ceiling, and the passage echoed faintly with each step.

Continuing forward, I heard another sound... Faint, possibly a voice.

It resembled a quiet whisper, unclear""Ahma."" (probably mother in Chinese)

Then I heard what sounded like a slow exhale close to my ear.

Back in the main building, I told a staff about what I had experienced.

She said, ""Many people hear things in that tunnel. Some things stay, even when they're gone.""

Though I don't claim to understand what I heard or felt, the visit to Unit 731 left an impression, not through horror or theatrics, but through the weight of documented history and preserved space.

It is a reminder of what human beings are capable of and why some places should be preserved, not forgotten.

The 3 A.m. Sleep Paralysis And Vivid Dreams,India,Old Hags / Night Attacks / Sleep Paralysis,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Old Hags / Night Attacks / Sleep Paralysis :: The 3 A.m. Sleep Paralysis And Vivid Dreams

The story is of my best friend. Let's call him Kapil. I am an eye witness of this.

This all happened during the lockdown in 2021. Kapil, my best friend, had been telling me about these really vivid and scary dreams he was having, always between 2 and 3 AM. He also mentioned experiencing sleep paralysis.

One day, with our exams approaching, I went over to his place for a night study session. It got pretty late, and around 1 AM, we decided to call it a night and get some sleep. We were sleeping in the same room, but our beds were on opposite walls.

Around 3 AM, I was jolted awake by a faint rustling sound. I sat up in my bed, and when my eyes landed on Kapil, a chill shot down my spine. He was thrashing, desperately trying to move, but couldn't, and his eyes were wide open. I immediately knew it was sleep paralysis.

Without thinking, I grabbed my water bottle and sprinkled a few drops on his face. It worked! He snapped out of it. But just as he did, we both heard it - the distinct sound of a plate dropping in the kitchen.

We were both instantly terrified. Neither of us dared to go check it out. Then, to our horror, the same sound came again. We just stayed frozen in our beds, listening.

After a few tense moments, we both started to relax a bit. I asked Kapil what had happened to him. He whispered that a ""totally black shadow"" had come and sat on his chest. He said he tried desperately to scream or even move his hands, but he couldn't. It was a truly terrible night for us.

After that night, I never tried to sleep at his home again. Kapil later told me that he continued to experience such incidents. Now he's in the UK, so I don't talk to him as much about it, but that night is something I'll never forget.

A Bizarre Encounter At The Olde Angel Inn,Canada,Ghost Tours & Haunted Hotels,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Ghost Tours & Haunted Hotels :: A Bizarre Encounter At The Olde Angel Inn

A t the early morning hours of May 25th, 1813, American military forces had launched a third invasion attempt against Canada. After U.S. Naval vessels had arrived along the shores of the Niagara River, a relentless two-day assault commenced against the British defense stronghold of Fort George. Despite valiant efforts to defend the fort, the Redcoat defenders were soon overwhelmed by the invading forces and had no other option than to abandon the fort. The Americans soon stormed into the adjacent town of Newark (modern day Niagara on the Lake) with the intentions of burning it to the ground. The siege ultimately led to a local tavern known as the Harmonious Coach House, where a British officer named Captain Colin Swayze would meet his tragic demise.

In order to flush out any enemy troops hiding within the tavern's basement, American soldiers took their bayonets and began systematically impaling the wooden wine barrels as well as any other objects capable of concealing any potential hiders. After being spotted within the confines of an empty barrel, Captain Colin Swayze was promptly stabbed and succumbed to his injuries almost immediately. (Mysteries of Canada, 2024)

Eventually, the Harmonious Coach House was renamed the Olde Angel Inn. Due to the utter brutality of Captain Swayze's death, it comes as no surprise that his restless spirit continues to linger aimlessly throughout the inn. Nestled within the heart of Niagara on the Lake, the Olde Angel Inn remains a popular destination for those intrigued by the many alleged hauntings reported over the span of several years. Being highly publicized in multiple paranormal reality shows, it becomes rather easy to understand why the inn receives such high amounts of revenue in tourism on an annual basis.

My first and only trip to the Olde Angel Inn happened back in August of 2006. I was accompanied by my mother, as well as my sister and brother. We had been informed of an apparent incident that occurred at the inn years prior to our arrival, which fueled our interests to visit. It was said that the incident involved a young American woman visiting the town with a group of her friends and decided to spend the night at the renowned hotel. She apparently wore a T-shirt depicting the image of a waving American flag. After exiting her room and nonchalantly traversing the hall, she abruptly stopped in her tracks, as she claimed to have felt the intense sensation of being slapped across the face. Though there was no definite proof to explain the encounter, it could be surmised that the vindictive Captain Swayze still continues to express his distain for those who happen to share the same nationality as the lone individual responsible for his departure.

We had finally arrived at the inn in the late afternoon. Though we were all mildly nervous, we were still highly excited and decided to help ease the tension by making jokes about the encounters reported by former guests. After an evening of bike riding, followed by an extended tour of Fort George, we decided to head back to the inn and go to sleep. For the first couple of hours, I struggled to fall asleep. Once I had begun to gradually calm myself down, I began to drift off and abruptly awoke, feeling as if someone had forcibly grabbed my shoulders. I was perfectly aware that I was the only one fully awake, as the others were peacefully sleeping in the adjacent bedroom. Despite the bewildering experience, I soon managed to fall asleep and woke up the following morning feeling well rested. The hotel had even given us a certificate to confirm our stay at the inn. As a humorous gesture, my mother decided to hang the certificate on our refrigerator. In spite of the strange experience, I still hope to one day return to the Olde Angel Inn and perhaps share even more personal stories.

What my Roommate Brought In,"Arizona, United States",Poltergeists / Physical Manifestations,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Poltergeists / Physical Manifestations :: What my Roommate Brought In

I n 2003 I moved into a brand new house southwest of Phoenix in a small farming community that stands in the shadows of the Estrella Mountains. It is a beautiful area and many times I am still overwhelmed by it's beauty. It was a tough adjust for this city slicker at first, where the only noises I would hear at night were the baying and yips of coyotes. And yes, there are tumbleweeds here. I only thought they existed in ""Roadrunner"" cartoons but I was wrong. I never felt anything odd about this house or the area. It had been a cotton field before homes were built.

In early 2004 I decided to take in a roommate to help offset the cost of living. A friend of mine, Michele, moved in with her little bichon dog. A few weeks later I was out of town for the weekend and Michele offered to watch my ferret, Monsoon. I returned late on a Sunday evening and was surprised to see Michele up still reading. She said everything went well over the weekend but she had some concerns over some noises she was hearing coming from my bedroom. My bedroom was right behind hers. She said while laying in bed she could hear what sounded like boxes being tossed around. At one point it got very loud. Then she heard scratching noises. She got up to investigate and upon entering my room found nothing out of place. Monsoon was sound asleep in her cage. She returned to her room and suddenly the noises started back up. Surely thinking Monsoon must have somehow gotten out of her cage, she returned to my room. Again nothing was out of place and Monsoon was still asleep in the same position she had been in previously. After that the noises stopped. I have never witnessed this so I pretty much dismissed it thinking she must have heard Monsoon messing with stuff.

Soon after, we woke up at 5am to the doorbell ringing. I got up to see who was being quite persistent at ringing the bell at such an early hour. Michele was already in the kitchen looking out the window. The dog was going crazy. Michele said, ""there's nobody out there..."" You have a clear view of the front door from the kitchen window. I stood by her side and watched the front door while the doorbell continued to ring with no one pushing the bell. I brought a chair into the living room, stood on it, and disconnected the bell. It was strange but I really didn't think anything else about it other than being a malfunction.

About a week later I awoke one morning to Michele knocking on my door telling me to come quick. I leaped out of bed and ran to see what was going on. She told me that she walked into the kitchen in the dark and that the dog wouldn't follow her in. He stood at the threshold whining. She turned on the light and much to her surprise, the kitchen linoleum was swimming with thousands of maggots. They were everywhere! I couldn't believe what I was seeing. The floor appeared to be moving on its on accord. I threw on some shoes, grabbed a broom, and started sweeping. Michele grabbed the dust pan and brush and did what she could before being overcome by nausea. She ran from the kitchen to her bathroom. I could hear her gagging. The dog remained at the threshold of the kitchen clearly agitated. I took a couple of deep breaths to keep myself from getting sick and began to sweep up the maggots.

I grabbed a trash bag and kept dumping them in. It took me about 45 minutes to get them all. I brought the bag outside and tied it in a knot. Upon returning to the kitchen there were more maggots squirming on the floor. Where the heck were they coming from? I checked the garbage, cabinets, under the sink and under the oven. They weren't coming from anywhere. They simply were just there. They were not confined to one area. I have a fairly big kitchen and they were spread out over the floor.

I started sweeping again and this time they did not come back. I got ready for work and grabbed the bag which I dumped into the dumpster on my way into the office. At the time I was working for a traditional Latin Catholic church (I was also working part-time as a Licensed Massage Therapist at a day spa but this will come into play later). I told the priests what had happened and they seem to believe that something more sinister was at work here. I really didn't know what to believe. I was the first owner of this house. How could this be happening? They believe that something was either attached to my roommate or an object that belonged to her, and that it was now in my house.

A gentleman from the church, who assists the priests in exorcisms, agreed to come to my house on a Saturday afternoon to bless it. I followed him from room to room as he prayed in Latin and marked the windows with a cross after he dipped his fingers in holy water. He placed St. Benedict medals (St. Benedict was an exorcist) in the four corners of my house for protection, as well as hang a St. Benedict crucifix in my bedroom.

Things did stop in the house but four months later I would wake thinking I had just heard the doorbell ring even though it was still disconnected. A couple of times I even got up to check. It made me wonder if whatever it was was waiting outside the door but couldn't cross the threshold in due to the blessing and the medals.

Not too long after the maggot incident, I was at my part-time job at a day spa when I had a woman come in needing a massage. She was a religious lady and told me that she was very active with her church. She told me she was trying to get her mother to stop practicing Catholicism. Being Catholic, I asked why. She said that her mother had called her one night and told her to come over because her kitchen floor was covered in maggots. I thought I was going to have a heart-attack right then and there. I asked her when this happened and it was determined that this happened the night before my incident.

She also went on to tell me that they could find no source for the maggots. She and a girlfriend of hers went to her mother's house and read the Bible out loud. She advised her mother to take down all her religious statues and pictures. My house is filled with religious pictures but I refuse to take something down that I have associated with good my whole life. In fact, they hang there to this day. I did not tell this woman that I was Catholic. I did not know her from a whole in the wall. This was a very strange occurrence. I couldn't help but wonder if whatever had caused this to happen at my house knew that in the near future I would meet up with this lady at the day spa. I'm quite puzzled with this one.

Regardless, after the blessing all strange activity in the house stopped. I still kept thinking I was hearing the doorbell ring first thing in the morning but that has stopped as well. I have long since reconnected the doorbell and have not had another occurrence. of bugs or bells.

Day Spa Spirit,"Arizona, United States",Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: Day Spa Spirit

I n the earlier part of this decade I worked as a Licensed Massage Therapist at a Day Spa in N. Phoenix. The Day Spa offered tanning, nail and skin care, and other run of the mill Spa amenities. It was housed in a very nondescript stucco strip mall that was probably fewer than 15 years old. One of the hairdressers kept complaining of getting ill there. She wanted the owners to check for asbestos. No one else was getting ill but her so the owners did not believe this to be an issue.

As it turns out, this lady thought that there was something else there besides asbestos. She believed the place to be haunted. The rest of us employees did not believe this at all. I have been in places --heck, I have lived in places-- that were haunted and have known pretty much from the get go that something was not right. This was not the case at the Day Spa.

A few weeks later this lady up and quit. She said she was getting too ill to stay. Before leaving she relayed a story to us about a trip she had taken to a psychic. The psychic told her that the Day Spa was located on what was sacred Indian ground. The psychic said that the spirit of an old Indian chief still remained in the building and he was very upset with the building being there. He didn't understand why it was there when it was clearly his land. He supposedly had a crush on one of the staff, a dark haired woman, but he didn't know how to get her attention. There were several of us working there with dark hair. I usually believe such tales but where I had not physical felt or experienced anything there I have to admit that I found this hard to believe. I had been there late at night by myself as well and never felt or experienced a single thing.

One morning soon after, I was sitting in my massage room sorting out my appointments for the day when I heard the small fountain I kept in there make a splashing noise. I got up to inspect and the water inside was moving. The fountain was not on. On the opposite side of the massage room was a Spray-On Tanning booth. The machine broke that morning and the inside was flooded with water. I helped the owner remove the water using buckets that we dumped into the sink in the restroom across the hall.

On a trip to dump the water in the restroom, I happened to glance up at the ceiling and see a fine mist billowing just above the door. I watched it for a few seconds. It appeared to be very vaporous in nature. At first I thought it may be coming from the Spray-On tan machine but the machine of course was broken. I looked away for a second and when I looked back it was gone. I scanned the ceiling area but there was nothing.

Later on in the day I had just finished up with a client and was heading to the sink to wash up. There was a woman collapsed and sweating on the floor. The owner of the salon was seated next to her with a cold compress on the woman's head. I asked what happened. Apparently the woman had gone in to a regular tanning bed and got very dizzy. She was headed to the restroom when she fainted in front of the restroom door. The place she collapsed? Right under where I saw the mist near the ceiling. The ambulance came and took her away.

The rest of the day passed without incident but I couldn't help but wonder if it really was that old Indian chief causing mischief to make himself known. Maybe the hairdresser wasn't as crazy as we all thought after all. I'll probably never know.

Elderly Wartime Map-readers,United Kingdom,Apparitions / Voices / Touches,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Apparitions / Voices / Touches :: Elderly Wartime Map-readers

I n the small town where I go to uni, there are quite a few stories of hauntings hither and thither, but I've never stumbled across any myself. However, the other day when I was walking back through some narrow residential streets, lined with pretty little cottages, I noticed an elderly couple standing on the corner of the pavement where the road split into a little T junction.

At first I didn't think anything of it, but as I got closer, I realized they were dressed rather oddly in clothes that looked as though they dated from World War II. They were stood on the corner of the street, staring up at an old cottage on the corner, a large map held between them. As I approached, they did not acknowledge me, but stood silent... Staring at this cottage. I walked by them, and they said nothing, just carried on staring.

Then, just as I passed by them, I glanced back over my shoulder and they were nowhere to be seen. Not even a second had passed by... Definitely not enough time for them to have gone inside the house, or walked away.

I don't know what happened that day. Whether what I saw were ghosts, or, as my friend suggested, a nick in the fabric of time so, for a moment, I was looking back in time... Who knows... Who knows...?

One thing I know for sure though is that they looked like a friendly, sweet old couple. :)

Harmless Haunting Just Got Scary,"Maryland, United States",Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: Harmless Haunting Just Got Scary

M y family consists of myself (I am 34), my husband, and our 3 sons. We have lived in our house for 12 years now. We knew almost right after we moved in that there were ""other people"" here. My husband sees things all the time and my 11 year old son has seen ghosts since he was very small.

Sometimes things are quiet here for several months at a time and then we will have activity for a few weeks. Not every night per say, sometimes 2 nights in a row, then nothing for a night or two. We get things that happen such as smoke filled rooms - We will walk into a room and it looks like someone took a bottle of baby powder and smashed it making a huge cloud of smoke. That is the only way I can describe it. But then it will disappear all at once within so many seconds.

We hear whispers very clearly. My husband and son both see a full bodied man walking around in here very regularly. We have found out that there was a man that died in our dining room (natural causes). We get a lot of shadow figures and sometimes even just shapes. I have no idea what the shapes mean (shapes, as in triangles, circles, squares). We seem to think that there is more than one ghost here. My husband has seen a woman, but only a few times and that has been about 2 years ago since he has seen her. There are the dark shadows as well. We don't think that the shadows are of the man that died here (his name is Bill, by the way) because when anyone sees Bill, they can see him very clear.

Sorry, I am not a good story teller and on top of that I am nervous about sharing with others.

What made me come to this forum is that my son was scared to death Saturday night (today is Monday). He was upstairs in his room and it was late. He was sitting at his computer desk playing a game on his cell phone. The speakers on the computer were turned off but there was noise that came across the speakers full blast. He said he jumped and went to turn off the speakers but they were already off. So he sat there for a second just looking around (paranoid). He said it then got very cold. He turned around and looked toward the steps and the lamp on his night stand came on. He felt a presence but could not see anything. The room then got very bright. He was petrified, and this kid does not scare easily. He is so used to seeing the ghost man (Bill) that is here that he doesn't even think twice about it. BUT - he felt a strong presence and he was truly scared. He said this one was different.

This is why I am looking to others for some advice. What should I do? Should I even do anything at all? Is there any way to make them go away?

I have emailed the pastor at my old church but I have not heard back from him. I am beginning to think that I won't.

Gardenways Cry for Help,United Kingdom,Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: Gardenways Cry for Help

W hen I lived with my dad at Gardenways holiday flats, a lot of strange things would happen. Our house used to be where the monks lived, there is a church located at the end of the street. One night when my dad and I were in the kitchen we both hear a child's

voice. I obviously looked at my dad, he looked at me. Neither of us said anything and continued with what we were doing. Shortly afterwards we both heard the voice again.

Not understanding what it was, dad went to his room and returned with a bat. I myself, very curious, went to the back door and peered through the window and there standing by the washing line, stood a little girl around 5-8 years of age wearing a black dress, black tights, black laced up boots and a white apron. Her hair was swept up in a bun with a bonnet covering her head.

I called for my dad as I couldn't believe what I was seeing. Dad took one look outside and also saw the same little girl standing there. I slowly opened the back door and stepped out, as I walked closer, the child was asking for help. I took a deep breath and whispered how can I help you? The girl just pointed. I turned and looked at that very moment my dad came running towards me and pushed me to the ground. I was so scared I had no idea what was going on. Dad was yelling at the child ""leave her alone we were only trying to help"". The child was lunging towards me, for what reason I will never know.

The next day my dad and I were in the back garden and we found about 30-50 1977 Britannia coins. My dad and I went to the church at the end of the street and we talked to our priest, we told him what had happened and he took us to the grave site of the child. Her name was Mary McDonald she died of pneumonia when she was about 7. Still to the day that dad sold the holiday flats, we would see ""Mary"" every year on the same day of her death but learnt our lesson not to go anywhere near her.

This is a true story and if you go there even to this day you are sure to see her.

My Childhood Ghost Stories,Philippines,Non Human Entities,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Non Human Entities :: My Childhood Ghost Stories

H ere are two of my ghost stories that happened during my childhood days in our province. I actually have several stories but I have to post it several times so you won't get bored reading my long stories. But first, pardon me if I will commit syntax errors, I'm not that good writing in English.

Both stories happened when I was still living in the province with my parents, circa 1980's. I used to live in a sleepy little barrio, an hour away from the big city. Back in 1980's only few privileged families has electricity in their home, and we belong to the less fortunate who couldn't afford to have one installed in our small house so at night, we use oil lamps as light.

One of our neighbors, the only family who had a television set around the neighborhood, would allow us to watch TV with them every time there are good shows or movies. So one night, me and my uncle went to our neighbor's house to watch a movie. The moon is full and the night is very bright so we don't need to carry a flashlight to light our way.

After the movie was finished, we went home (that time, my uncle was still staying with us). When I went to bed, the lights were already off but the moonbeam is seeping through our windowpanes so it's kind of bright inside my room. When I was about to sleep, I noticed a strange black thing beside my bed so I looked closer. It was a black, hairy hands with red long finger nails and it just seems to be resting just where I could see it! I felt afraid but at the same time, I was curious. I resisted myself to peek under my bed thinking I might see things I don't want to see, so I just moved farther from the hand and crawled under my blanket. When I woke up, it was already morning and the hand is gone. I never told anyone about this.

My second story happened maybe just a few months after the previous one. It was one moonless night and my father asked me to buy him some cigarettes from the only sari-sari store located a few houses away from our house. It was a pitch black night but since I know my way by heart, I didn't bring a flashlight. I was still in our front yard when I stepped on some loose stones so I fell face down. I was about to get up when just right in front of my face, I saw a smoke forming in shape of a dog. I couldn't believe my eyes because I'm sure that I'm all alone in that area.

Again, I felt so afraid. I wanted to go back home but not wanting to get my father angry, I bravely stood up (although my knees were shaking from fear) and ran towards the store. When I went back home, I ran as fast as I can so that I will not see that entity or whatever it was again.

Young Girl Appears When I Bathe my Son,United Kingdom,Apparitions / Voices / Touches,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Apparitions / Voices / Touches :: Young Girl Appears When I Bathe my Son

I myself do not believe in ghosts, I don't know why, I just think some things aren't possible. To my surprise one day, my Mum asked me if I would like her to take my daughter away on holiday with her for a week. I asked my husband and we decided yes, as we wouldn't be able to afford a holiday, I had just had another baby so we would have to wait.

So in August 2007 my 5 year old daughter, with her long blonde hair, left our house in Northfield, Birmingham UK to go away to the Lake District with my Mum, my Step dad and my younger sister.

Nothing in particular struck me at first, my husband went to work as usual, leaving me with my baby. About the third day into my daughters absence I noticed a little girl in my house. I was bathing my baby, roughly 5pm, and it was only us two in the house along with my 2 cats. I have a black cat and a grey and white one. Behind me as I'm bending over the bath is my bedroom and the baby's bedroom.

Out of the corner of my eye I saw a figure come from the stairs (as if they had just climbed them) and walked straight across behind me towards either my bedroom or the baby's, I can't be sure which room she went in as when I turned around she wasn't there, so I assumed that it was my black cat infused with my imagination (this is what I told myself). This little girl was about 7 years old, long dark hair, and wearing what I can only describe as a dark old fashioned dress. Not black, but a green or navy dress. Almost Victorian. When going downstairs I see my black cat fast asleep under a tree in the garden, my other cat sleeping on the sofa. I thought nothing more of it and went about my usual routine.

The next evening I bathed the baby again, as he had just started feeding himself so it was very messy. Just us two in the house again, but it was earlier, about 4pm. The exact same thing happened, I bent over the bath and this little girl walked from the staircase, behind me, and disappeared into one of 2 bedrooms. By this point I was thinking that it was just me being silly and missing my daughter. I had heard from her everyday so I knew she was ok.

I told my husband about what I thought I had seen and he got a little spooked, he believes more than I do, and things like that give him goose bumps. I told him not to be so silly and over react.

I didn't bath my son the next day, and I never saw her, not once.

The day my daughter was due home I got my son bathed and dressed, This time it was morning, he had his breakfast so it was about an 11am bath. Sure enough as I bent over the bath I saw her again! Doing the exact same thing, walking the exact same way, wearing the exact same thing. I got my son out of the bath and went downstairs. I heard creaking on my landing and assumed (again) it was my black cat, as he is rather large and heavy. He was in the garden playing with my other cat.

She only appeared when I was upstairs with my baby, she never came downstairs, I never saw her downstairs, not once. When my daughter got home I forgot about it, I tried to push it out of mind. Although I still hear the creaking, I haven't seen her since.

She is the opposite in colouring to my daughter, she has long dark hair, and is extremely pale. My daughter is pale but not dark haired. I couldn't see her eyes. Or any of her facial features, but her cheek showed she was caucasian. Her dress showed she's Victorian (maybe) I am very confused about it, and I don't want to disrespect her, should she be real. She hasn't done any harm, or made too much noise.

Paralyzed in Bed While my Father Sees Me in His Room,United Kingdom,Old Hags / Night Attacks / Sleep Paralysis,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Old Hags / Night Attacks / Sleep Paralysis :: Paralyzed in Bed While my Father Sees Me in His Room

I have had many experiences but this by far was the most scary and real. I was in bed sleeping on a hot summers night - suddenly I woke for no apparent reason, I could hear this creaking going around my bed then slowly but surely, it felt as if something was sitting on my chest, it felt as if my soul was being dragged away from me then pulling back in, the whole time this was happening I was praying out of desperation.

All the time this was happening, I was struggling to breath and I was SO scared I didn't know what to do, I couldn't even turn my bedside lamp on which was so close to me as I was scared that something would grab me.

Eventually the feeling lifted and after around 20 minutes I went back to sleep.

Think that's weird - wait until you hear this! I went downstairs the next morning as soon as I got into the kitchen, my dad looked at me with a worrying face and asked if I was ok? I explained what happened - he just stared at me with disbelief as I told him.

When I had explained, he went on to tell me that he was in the night as I was sitting on the end of his bed in SPIRIT form talking to him about the weather?

Lady of the Lake,Canada,Family / Friends Visits,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Family / Friends Visits :: Lady of the Lake

M y maternal grandfather grew up in a remote area of Nova Scotia, Canada in the 1930s. His mother passed away of a severe ear infection when he was quite young. In the area they lived in, there were no real doctors to prescribe antibiotics, which quite possibly could have saved her life. My grandfather's father remarried a woman whom I met as a teenager when she was in her late 90s.

The story I am about to relay has been in my family since I can remember. As a little boy of about 6 or 7, my grandfather didn't really have much supervision. As they weren't the wealthiest of folks, my grandfather's father spent many hours away from the house as a ferry captain. I no longer remember the name of the boat but I believe it is actually pictured on the Canadian dime.

My grandfather and his buddies one day decided to take a row boat out onto the nearby lake. They rowed to the middle of the lake and were messing around like little kids do when suddenly they dropped an oar into the lake. They paddled their hands to reach it. My grandfather reached for the oar and the boat started to tip. Much to all their surprise, a female hand rose out of the water and handed my grandfather back the oar! All the little boys sat quietly for a few minutes in shock. They scanned the water's surface to see if someone had possibly gone for a swim. There was no one in the water coming up for air. There were no other boats at the lake either. They rowed back to shore as quickly as they could and each ran home. My grandfather relayed the story to his step-mother who stared at him warily. In later years she confessed that she believed him to be telling the truth.

Not too long after my grandfather and his friends were back at the lake. They were standing on a bridge looking into the water when they could see stones being thrown into the water. The stones were coming from above them and seem to appear as if they were falling from the sky. My grandfather looked down into the water and there, just below the surface, was the image of a woman looking up at him. I don't have anymore details of what this woman looked like. It has long been believed in my family that the woman that handed him the oar and the woman under the water, were his mother looking out for him still from the other side.

On that same trip where I met my great-step-grandmother as a teenager, I was taken to the area where my grandfather grew up. It was a remote, wild, and beautiful area. I saw the lake where all this occurred. My grandfather passed away from cancer in the early 1970s. I was only 4 years old. I do not have much by way of personal memories of him but this one story of him as a brave little boy who had lost him Mom will stay with me for the rest of my life. Thanks for reading.

Angel of Death,"Michigan, United States",Demons / Possessions / Exorcisms,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Demons / Possessions / Exorcisms :: Angel of Death

L iving in the ever present sense of being watched from afar by unseen forces, I was at my parents' home on a cold winter day, when the doorbell rang. Mom came in with a few packages from shopping, took them in her room as usual and closed the door behind her. This house was arranged with a long corridor separating three bedrooms from the living room, kitchen and bathroom. From the bedrooms you could enter the living room at the front of the house and the kitchen towards the rear.

I walked back into the kitchen from another door that led from the living room directly into the kitchen. From the other kitchen entrance leading into the corridor I noticed a large shadowy silhouette on the far wall. It was the rounded part of an angel wing as portrayed in photos. It was so big; I didn't immediately notice the shape of the head on the ceiling. I first assumed it was a shadow of something new in the room, but found nothing that was rounded at the top, nor any combination of things that would give that shape.

Realizing it was the angel of death, I heard told about. I backed up, keeping my eyes on the figure as long as possible backing into the living room. The shadow was now at the front of the house, on the same wall. I walked forward back into the kitchen, there it was again. I backed up slowly and the thing floated toward the living. I did this four or five times, each time the image moved with me as if it was going to meet me in the other room and stopped at the other entrance of the corridor. Mom came out of her room and the image vanished.

A couple of days later, I felt sluggish and somewhat grouchy; not well at all. I don't recall how the conversation went, when mom grabbed me by my shoulders and shook me violently and yelled ""Satan turn loose of my daughter - in the name of Jesus..."" It felt as if the world had been lifted from my shoulders. I looked up and saw a shadow of no particular from, rush out of the top of the living room door that leads outside. My head cleared, my energy returned and I felt great; a little baffled at what I saw, but I was back to normal.

Glowing Nurse Apparition,"Michigan, United States",Apparitions / Voices / Touches,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Apparitions / Voices / Touches :: Glowing Nurse Apparition

I was in the hospital after the birth of my first child. In the wee hours, just before sunrise, I opened my eyes just a little and saw about five inches of an almost glowing white dress. Assuming it was a nurse's uniform, I laid there waiting on her to attend to me with either taking my temperature, blood pressure, blood; something. (It was back in the day when your chart was on a clipboard at the foot of your bed or on the wall at the foot of your bed.)

A couple of minutes past and I started to wonder what was taking her so long to jet to me, but brushed it off as she was checking my chart or straightening my bedside table, maybe making sure there was water in my little picture, but I heard nothing. After about what seemed like 15 minutes, I opened my eyes and no one was there.

A few minutes later, in comes the nurse. She has on white pants (nowhere near the white I saw earlier) and a colorful scrub top. She wanted to take my temp and blood pressure.

It'd just me and her. ""You'll have a different nurse tomorrow night, I have the night off. Her name is Sheryl, she's nice, everyone likes her. I'll see you the following night if you're still here. Have a good day, you have a beautiful baby.""

Mexican Woman Ghost in my Bed,Mexico,Apparitions / Voices / Touches,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Apparitions / Voices / Touches :: Mexican Woman Ghost in my Bed

M y story takes place in puerto penasco aka rocky point in mexico. Me and my friends decided to take a trip to rocky point for spring break in 08. It was just kind of a spur of the moment kind of thing, so we didn't set no reservations at any hotels. Well when we got there, we decided to stay in a small hotel called ""Hotel Arizona"". It was not the greatest looking hotel but the owner offered us a good price so we had to take it.

We decided to unpack and go out and party because we got there like around 9pm. After a long night of clubbing we headed back to the hotel to get some sleep. I would say it was around 3am when we finally got back. The room was an average size room with two beds in it which me and another friend shared.

I ended up falling asleep within a couple of minutes of getting into bed. I'm fast asleep and I remember something just messing with my face, I finally wake up thinking it's like a mosquito or something. I get on my knees in bed to grab the covers behind me and when I look straight at the head board, I see a small mexican woman in my bed on my pillow. She looked like she was probably in her late 20's or early 30's. I could see her face perfectly.

At first I thought it was an actual person and I got scared and threw a punch at it because it startled me. But when I swung and hit nothing but air I knew something was wrong. I jumped out of bed still looking at it and it turned into a black ball of mist and disappeared. After that happened I turned on both the light and the tv and stayed awake the whole night.

Daring Spirits with a Ouija Board,"Kentucky, United States",Ouija Board / Seances,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Ouija Board / Seances :: Daring Spirits with a Ouija Board

M y experience happened about six months ago and after it happened, I stopped using a Ouija board immediately and this story is true. I'm sixteen just so you know and my friend Britney is seventeen. We were at her house one night, she lives about two minutes away, I could walk if I wanted too. It was really dark outside and I brought over a Ouija board. I never played with one before and I heard a lot about evil things coming from within the board so I figured let's have some fun and see if you can really talk to spirits.

We pulled out blankets and sat on our sleeping bags, mind you, we were in her basement, and we turned off all the lights to play. At first we were afraid to play, but we figured we'd give it a try. Now I can't remember much of what happened, but everything I'm about to explain did happen.

We put our hands on the glass pointer and asked if any spirits were around. At first, nothing, and we kept asking the same question over and over, then it moved to yes. We were freaking out, but in a exciting way. We asked the spirit if it was a male or female and it said a male. Britney asked the spirit if he knew me or her well. And it said yes. I asked it if it was my guardian angel and it moved to yes.

Then after that question, the lights were flickering on and off. Me and Britney were really scared, but we just were too afraid to move so we kept playing. We asked it a bunch of questions, if it knew my grandma and it said yes. Then we started doubting this 'spirit', we asked if it could do something to prove it was really a spirit.

I called my boyfriend Steve up on my cell phone and asked him to touch a random part of his body and not to tell me what he's touching, he questioned why, but I didn't tell him what was going on because he doesn't believe in any of this stuff, so I told him to just do it. I then asked the spirit to tell me what my boyfriend was touching on his body. The letters right foot was spelled out. I asked my boyfriend if he was touching his right foot and he was like ""yeah, why what's going on?"" And I began to freak out.

I told my boyfriend what was going on, but while I was on the phone with him, a screeching sound came across and I could barely hear him. I just told him I'd call him back later and got back to the game. We played for about four hours that night and went to bed.

The next day, me and Britney woke up and walked over to my house to eat since her house didn't have any food. We came in my house and brought the Ouija board with us because we were amazed by this. It was like we were addicted to playing, once we came to my house we sat on the floor and asked if there were any spirits in the room and it said yes. Then we asked it if it was the same spirit from last night and it said yes again. Then we asked it if it could hide or lose something that we both know very well because we were still not convinced that this was a spirit. It said yes and nothing happened so we stopped playing, but then an hour later my dad came in from the door with groceries and he looked mad.

I asked him what was wrong and he said our basketball goal is missing. And I was shocked because me and Britney didn't see anyone go by my house while we were running around the house. I mean our basketball goal was planted in the ground by our garage and our neighbors would never steal from us, also we live in a great neighborhood and nothing ever was stolen.

After the disappearance of the basketball goal, I've stopped playing the Ouija board. My friend Britney still plays and it seems like she has changed over the past couple of months, she keeps telling me to play again, but I never do. For anyone who is thinking about playing with a Ouija board, I urge you to just forget about it.

The Gray Woman Is Still Here!,"Nebraska, United States",Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: The Gray Woman Is Still Here!

M y mother and I returned home on New Years night. My sister arrived just as we did, being dropped off by her friends parents. When we entered the apartment, the Christmas tree once again laid on its side with the lights on. I had turned them off the day before when my mom and sister had left the apartment. There was a chill in the air. Mom went to the thermostat to adjust the temperature. She noted that it was turned up to 70 Fahrenheit, but it was freezing in the apartment still. She turned it up another five degrees and stated she would contact the land lord the next morning.

I was exhausted. I went to the door of my bed room to go in and get ready for bed. All of the sudden I heard my sister scream. I ran out of my room, meeting up with my mom in the hall way right outside of my sister's room. The door was closed. I reached out to turn the door handle and it was freezing to the touch. We entered her room. My sister was standing in the middle of the room with tears streaming down her cheeks, her eyes wide. All of her clothes had been taken out of her dresser and closet and were thrown about the room randomly. Some hung from the mirror, some from the ceiling fan, falling off the bed, on the floor, everywhere. She had two dolls on her bed. Both of them had their plastic heads removed and placed next to them with the faces in the pillow.

At this point, I stood there with my mouth hanging open, mom ran to the door to check for signs of forcible entry. Of course, there were none. I ran back to my room, opened the door to find almost an identical sight. There were no dolls in my room, but all of the clothes were thrown everywhere and every one of my books was on the floor, face down. There were at least one hundred or so paper backs on that shelf and not one of them had managed to land face up on the floor!

We then, all three of us, went to my moms room, opened the door and absolutely nothing was out of place except her pillows. She had two heart shaped pillows that always sat in the middle of her bed. One of the pillows had my name stitched on it; the other had my sister's name. Both pillows were on the floor, upside down, side by side.

At this point my mom began to look a little frantic herself. My mom had been through a lot in her life and at this point, very little seemed to ruffle her, but this did. She told me she was going up stairs to knock on the neighbors doors and see if they had seen any one near or heard any one in our apartment. My sister and I, still in a bit of a daze just shook our heads.

In the apartment we lived in, the only way to get to the neighbors was to go outside and around to the side, up the stairs and knock on their doors.

I heard the front door open and close. I looked down at my sister who was still crying and told her we needed to go in the kitchen, have some hot chocolate and veg out in front of the television. I let her know we would clean up my bed and she could bunk with me for the night as I had a double bed, and we would start cleaning the mess in the morning. She seemed to relax a bit with that suggestion.

We walked down the short corridor to the kitchen. I had just gotten the cocoa and the milk out. I was opening the cabinet to get a pan and the laughing started again. It was just as it had been the night before ! It seemed to be coming from everywhere all at once, as if on a speaker system. We just stood there and looked at each other; I did not have to ask if she had heard it, I could tell by the way she was looking at me.

Both my sister and I took off running for the front door at a dead heat. My mom was just coming back up the walk from the side of the house to the door. I could see, behind my mom, about 20 feet away, the gray woman! She appeared to be hovering about seven feet off the ground again and waving at me! I could not see her eyes as it was dark, but I could FEEL the stare! Somehow I also knew she was smiling as before. I stood there for a few moments, finally coming out of my stupor when mom asked me if I would move to let her in. I stepped aside, as I turned back to the window to see if the woman was still there, she was gone.

Mom looked out and asked what I saw. I shook my head and told her it was nothing. My sister was standing there and she had been frightened enough lately. Mom advised us that our direct upstairs neighbors heard some vague movement in the apartment and some laughter, but they thought we were home. Mom told them we had not been home and asked if they saw anyone coming or going. They stated they hadn't and they had been home all day and the night before.

We slept pretty well, at least without incident that night and repaired the damage to the rooms. Mom called the land lord. He came over within an hour. He checked the furnace and advised us it was in working order. He changed the dead bolts on the front door and the back door, although we never used the back door. I stood there thinking that the uninvited visitor that had been in the apartment did not need a key.

Things died down for a few months until spring rolled around. With the thaw, my gray woman friend returned.

Go to Sleep,"Oregon, United States",Old Hags / Night Attacks / Sleep Paralysis,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Old Hags / Night Attacks / Sleep Paralysis :: Go to Sleep

T his happened just this morning. I woke up early this morning and felt like something was watching me. I knew it was him (him being my beastly friend ). I ignored the feeling and closed my eyes again hoping that it would just leave. I was wrong.

I like to sleep against the wall so I was on that side and suddenly I slid towards the edge of the bed like someone heavy had sit next to me. I felt heavy arms grab me and hold me. I asked it to leave but I only heard breathing other than mine.

I tried to get up on my own but it only held me tighter and said ""Shhh go back to sleep..."" It has done this once before also. He just sits there holding me and telling me to go to sleep. When I didn't, he said it again but this time he said my name ""Tiersa go back to sleep...""

In my last story Michael likes the Rain Too I talked about my first sighting. People gave me the advice to try and talk to him again. So I closed my eyes and said Michael's name over and over again in my mind and asked him to help me. Then all of a sudden its hands let go of me and it started raining and I felt calm once again.

Do you think Michael really heard me or do you think it just decided to leave. Let me know because it's driving my mind crazy

The Old Lady,"New York, United States",Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: The Old Lady

T his story takes place many years ago, where I was born and raised in Spanish Harlem, in New York City. I was a child of about 4-5 when before me, I saw an old lady or hag, she never said say anything to me, she stared at me in a creepy kind of way. According to an older sister who is now deceased, strange things happened, items would disappear from the kitchen, strange lights were seen on the bedroom ceilings. I told my father about the old lady Isaw, and he asked me if she ever said anything to me, I told him no, she just looks at me. I saw her maybe 3 times.

Now, many years later when an older brother passed away, while at his services, my sister just happened to mention that he had seen the old lady too, But of course, he was gone and I had no chance to discuss it with him, and what he had seen, or if she had said anything to him. As best as I remember her, besides being very old, she was very petite and wore her hair in an old fashioned bun. She was wearing a white apron over a long grey dress, she did not look like anyone I knew, but even at that age, I knew what I was seeing was something strange. I have never fogotten this incident, I am now almost in my 60s, so you can see it had a profound effect on me.

It has also made me have a very open mind about the paranormal and supernatural. The apt. building stands to this day, and last Sept. When I visit my family back East, I make it a point to go passed the building. I look up at the window where my family once lived, and know that I had an encounter with something otherworldly. I have retold this story to the best of my recollection, and it is the truth.

This is kind of a follow-up; for newbies I will brief: When I was about 5, I saw an ""old woman"" in the NY Apt. I lived in with my parents. She wore her hair in a bun, and was petite, she never said a word to me, but I knew, even at that age, that she was 'otherworldly'

Through the ""wonders"" of the internet, I was able to track down the company that manages the building. I called and spoke to the manager, a friendly gent by the name of Tony. I explained my reason for the call, and he was gracious, and told me that ""no"", he had never heard of any ""strange"" phenomenon at the building, but that he would keep my phone number, and contact me in the future should anything of this nature come to light. I must admit I was surprised, as I know this apt. had spirits, as well as I believe two other apt.

I have to keep in mind, that the building has undergone renovations over the years, the front of the building looks entirely different from the time my family and I lived there, this building is very old, at least 85 or more.

Now, it seems to me that maybe some people may have, and are hesitant to mention it for fear of being ""labeled"" Maybe some people had the apt. blessed, or maybe no one has ever ""really"" seen or experienced anything.

I would appreciate some feedback, as I know my family and I did experience phenomenon. Regards.

Out of Body Experience,"California, United States",Misc,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Misc :: Out of Body Experience

I was 16 years old when I experienced what I think was an out of body experience. I was sleeping on the floor of my bedroom and all of a sudden I felt like I needed to wake up. The thing was, I was already ""awake"" but I was watching myself from above my body. I don't know how to put what it was like into words other than to say physically I was lying down, unable to move. Mentally, I was scared and wanted to cry and yell for my mom, but I couldn't. I couldn't even open my eyes.

I have read stories on here about sleep paralysis, but I don't think I have read one where the person is also looking down at themselves from somewhere above. I know it wasn't a dream because while looking down at myself I was wearing the same pajamas and I was sleeping in the same position I was when I went to bed. The reason why this tells me I wasn't dreaming is because I have back problems and sometimes have to sleep in any position that is comfortable when my back is hurting. Sometimes it takes me being a human pretzel to be comfortable.

While this was happening I felt as if someone were there, watching me from the doorway, which was to the right of me. Also, when I woke up, it was as if I had done it on my own. It wasn't a rude awakening, if you will.

The next day I told my mom about it, I was expecting her to tell me I was weird, instead she told me that it had happened to her too.

A few years prior to my experience, my mom was in a very bad car accident. While in surgery, she said she woke up and was watching herself being worked on from up above. She never told me about it because she didn't want to scare me, but she did tell her friend. Her friend told her it was an out of body experience.

Presence in EMU Dorms Dislikes Unmade Beds?,"Michigan, United States",Apparitions / Voices / Touches,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Apparitions / Voices / Touches :: Presence in EMU Dorms Dislikes Unmade Beds?

I have an hour gap between my two classes on Tuesdays and Thursdays, and usually I go back to my dorm during that hour and take a nap, since I rarely get to bed at a decent hour. I could use the whole 'college kid, gotta study into the wee hours of the morning' excuse, but usually I'm just farting around the internet, losing track of the time. In any case, I nap.

One morning, however, when my alarm went off to alert me to the fact that it was time to get up and head out to my second class, I decided that it wouldn't hurt me to miss just one day, especially since I was so tired that the very thought of getting up was making my head hurt. Subsequently, I turned off the alarm and fell back into bed.

I woke up again around noon, just as that second class would have been ending, because my roommate had gotten up and was moving around the room to get ready for her own class--the lucky wench managed to get classes that were later in the day. As I was laying there, thinking about who I should email to get the day's notes (I'm not completely irresponsible... Just mostly so), I heard a loud, angry male's voice say, rather quickly, ""Get up and make the bed,"" or perhaps just ""Make the bed...""

This was pretty disconcerting, as, the last time that I'd checked, my roommate was female and had a voice that was hard to mistake for anything remotely masculine. So I sat up and looked out at her, but she didn't even seem to notice that I was awake or the voice itself: she gathered her books and left the room, leaving me to lay back in bed and wonder what the hell I'd just heard.

Encounters in my House,"Pennsylvania, United States",Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: Encounters in my House

H ello everyone, this is my first ghost story so please go easy on me. The encounters I'm about to tell you is totally true, but it's possible that I might of imagined some of them. Anyway, it's up to you to decide!

I was in my room one time, and I was getting ready for bed when all of a sudden I see this orb floating near my bedroom window. I didn't think much of it, but it was a little spooky I have to admit. I believe this was my first ghost experience, and a sign that my house is possibly haunted.

Here's a creepy encounter: On Halloween night, my siblings were watching T.V in the living room while my dad was on the computer. My mom was in the basement, doing the laundry. Everybody was busy doing their own thing, so I was the only one who witnessed this. I was sitting on the living floor... Not really paying attention to the T.V. and I don't know why, but I just happened to glance at the kitchen.

Now, let me explain how my house is set up so you don't get confused. The kitchen is sort of connected to the dining area which leads to the living room. So if you're in the living room, you can get a good view of the dining room and the kitchen at the same time. So, there I was sitting on the floor and then a dark figure walks into the dining room. I thought it was my mom at first, but then I suddenly realized she was in the basement. I couldn't see the figure anymore, because it went all the way in the back of the dining area. And here's the part when I totally freak out... My mom comes out from the basement with the laundry basket. I rushed into the dining room. The figure was gone. I was so confused, that I actually started crying!

I never saw the dark figure after that incident. But I did have another ghostly encounter.

Last month my sister was at this Webkinz club at school. So it was just me, my mom, and my little brother at home. I sat next to my mom on the couch because I wanted to watch Oprah with her. But after a few minutes I got thirsty, so I went into the kitchen for a drink. I opened the fridge and I searched for the Pepsi. When I spotted it, I reached and gabbed it. As I was doing this, out of the corner of my eye, I saw a little girl walk up to me, stopped at stared, and left the kitchen. I ignored her because I was thinking she was my sister, but when I finished my drink I realized she was at the Webkinz club! I was really, really surprised.

Another time, my friend came over and I told her about some strange things that recently happened in our house. She agreed that the house was officially haunted, so we decided to go on a little ""ghost hunt"". That's when we began our investigation. Our first stop was the basement, because our cats always sensed something down there. To make a long story short, we got really creepy vibes like something was watching us. We even heard footsteps and that sent us screaming and running upstairs. It was actually really fun, but scary at the same time.

One day, (this is my recent experience) the cats were meowing loudly in the basement. I guess they sensed something, so I went down to check. I stopped on the fifth step or so because there was this blue, misty fog just hovering in one spot. It was so creepy, it sent shivers down my spine. I'm not sure if this was part of my imagination, but it just seemed so vivid and real.

Well - I hope you enjoyed my story. Sorry if I didn't include many details, but my experiences are kind of hard to explain. I'll keep you posted and if you have any advice, questions, or whatever please comment. Negative or positive, I welcome all!

Sister Turned Mean Because of a Ghost,"California, United States",Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: Sister Turned Mean Because of a Ghost

I heard this story from my mother how she encountered a ghost. A long time ago my mom who was my age (16) and her two older siblings just moved into this really small house. My mom made new friends quickly at school and one of them was named Ashley. She told my mom how everyone thought that the house my mom moved into was haunted because people seemed to see strange things by the house. My mom believed in ghosts, but she wouldn't think that her family would actually move into a haunted house.

Over a couple of weeks, strange things began to happen, my mom told me that while she laid in bed she could hear scratches on the walls and randomly lights would turn on and off. She also told me that when her and her siblings would play checkers, one or two checkers would be missing and randomly show up anywhere with a thumb printed in the checker.

One night my mom was sleeping and woke up. She told me that she just sat up in bed and just looked at the door for no reason what so ever, she just felt the need to look at her door. She could see the hallway from her door and she could see her sisters room across from hers. A pale man with a suit walked into her sisters room. He looked over at my mom and grinned. My mom was shocked to see a ghost walking into her sisters room so she just was frozen in fear.

She told me that the ghost had a hat on with a feather in it. He looked like he was from the civil war. What is weird is that my moms sister, after that night, started getting meaner and meaner. My moms sister hates my mom for no reason AT ALL. My mom told me that over the years her sister has gotten weirdly mean and just terrible and she told me it all happened after that night she saw the ghost.

The Joey Doll,"California, United States",Old Hags / Night Attacks / Sleep Paralysis,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Old Hags / Night Attacks / Sleep Paralysis :: The Joey Doll

I was 11 years old living in Santa Rosa, CA. We rented a small duplex in an old neighborhood. It was always cold and damp, and smelled like mold. My room was in the back of the duplex, it had large sliding glass doors that would go out into the weed infested back yard.

One night in the wintertime at about 2am, I awoke suddenly with my eyes wide open. I felt a presence in the room. My room was only lit by the moonlight. I felt some pressure on my chest, I tried to speak but couldn't, it was a choking, throbbing in my throat. My arms and legs went stiff as a board, I couldn't move them at all. Even my neck stiffed up. My muscles were all clenched up. I could only move my eyes around the room.

I looked up at my bookshelf case. It stands about 8 feet high. On the very top of the shelf I could see my doll sitting there starring down at me. The doll was a gift from my mother, his name was ""Joey"". It was called a Joey Doll. I was so very scared. I'm getting goose bumps even now writing this and I'm 32 years old now.

Eventually since nothing else happened, I fell asleep. But I'll never forget that night for the rest of my life... The doll was still up there in the morning. I took it down and threw it out.

My Mom,Australia,Family / Friends Visits,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Family / Friends Visits :: My Mom

A ugust 12th 2000. It was evening, and we were waiting for bad news to ring on our phone. It was something that we were expecting, from the time it was first diagnosed, earlier that year. The phone rang at about 9pm that night. She had passed away quietly with a nurse aid by her side. At least she wasn't alone when she passed...

My mother was diagnosed with cancer in May of 2000. The doctors did not know what type of cancer because the cancer had already spread itself throughout her entire body. It was already at terminal stage when tests revealed that the cancer had eaten its way through her thigh bone. The doctors informed us that she may have 3 years left in her. We weren't prepared with 3 months. My mother was placed in a Hospice which was in the heart of the city. We were half an hour to 45 minutes drive away, north of the city.

One week before her time, my dad mentioned to her, ""Should anything happen, do I have your blessing to remarry for companionship?"" My mom looked at him and said ""Yes..."" Nothing more was mentioned after that.

On the night she passed, I said to my husband let's go and see her. We were told we could come into the Hospice anytime during the night and the next day to say Goodbye. It seemed so final. My Dad was staying with us in the house, and he told us, if the phone call came during the night, just to let him know the following morning and he would say his goodbyes then. The kids were already tucked in bed and my husband's cousin offered to watch them while we went to see Mom.

We arrived at the Hospice soon after, and walked into Mom's room. The atmosphere was incredible. It was warm in her room. She was on the bed, propped up in a sitting position with her pillows supporting her. I wish I could say that she looked peaceful, but to tell the truth, she looked so empty. Just a few days ago she was smiling through her pain, now, there was no life left in her body. Her eyes were partly opened and she felt cool to the touch. I suddenly couldn't breathe and burst out of the room. All I could think of was to go... Be as far away as I could. My husband tried to soothe me, calm my breathing down. The nurses asked if I would like a cup of tea. I politely denied their offer and asked my husband if we could go home.

We had parked our car on the street, and as soon as my husband turned the key in the ignition, the motor would sound up but then die. He attempted a few more times to start the motor, but it would not budge. The car didn't have any problems during the week or during that day, so we were puzzled as to why it would not start now. Suddenly it hit me. MOM! It seemed it was her way of telling us not to go yet. But I knew I could not go back into that Hospice and back into that room.

Hubby suggested that we will need to push start the car, so it was my choice to steer and clutch start it up or hop out and push. I offered to push. Our first attempt failed as we reached the end of the street. We pushed the car around to face the other way and made our way up to the other end of the street with my husband doing a co-ordination of ignition, clutch and gears. We must've looked a sight. ""Please Mom, let us go!"" I cried and as if by some miracle, the car suddenly started up on its own. ""Thanks Mom,"" I whispered to myself. Coincidence? Perhaps.

But remember when I mentioned about Dad asking for Mom's blessing to remarry? Well, after the fiasco of her funeral and grieving, 2 weeks after, my Aunty approached my Dad with surprising news. Apparently, Mom had arranged another wife for Dad. During her last week, she asked my Aunty to find a lady over in the Philippines. All she remembers of this woman is her name and region where she may still be living. Imagine this, they were school mates in high school, and have not seen each other since then.

So, my Mom had no idea about her life, if she were married, had kids or if she was still alive. My Aunty had many contacts over in Phils and it wasn't before too long, they were able to track her down. She was a school teacher, teaching primary school aged children. She still lived at home, taking care of her own mother and had never married! We were blown away by it all.

Soon enough, my Dad and this woman started to contact each other. She then came to Australia to meet us all. How could I describe our first meeting? She was small and slim, like my Mom. She had the same hair style. From afar, one would swear it was my Mom. But the difference between her and my Mother was the affection. She was 10 times more affectionate than my mother was. She opened her arms and her heart to us and her smile lit up the entire room. My mother rarely smiled. The following year, my Dad married the woman. I now, call her Mom and the kids call her grandma.

To top this story off, whether it's coincidence or it would have some big hidden meaning to it all, my two daughters have the same birthday as my Mom. February 5th.

If anyone has an idea about numbers or the coincidences that seem to happen during these times, I look forward to reading your comments. God Bless

"Sleep Possession, Demons, Ouija Board","Indiana, United States",Ouija Board / Seances,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Ouija Board / Seances :: Sleep Possession, Demons, Ouija Board

I understand as you read this you will be skeptical, but keep in mind, I am writing this to help anyone suffering from night possession, bad dreams or spiritual harassment.

First I would like to start my story by saying for many years I have been a very bad sleep walker. I sleep walk a lot, and I researched it very much. The sleep walking I had was very similar to the way night terrors are described on wikipedia but also very different.

Once I chased my roommates son and tried to hurt him. I have punched doors, walls, broken chairs and other furniture. The scariest two times for me however when once, I woke up and thought to myself ""oh no not again!"". The fact that I could think that and then continued my sleep walk rampage upset me a little.

The other time was when I hadn't slept for a day, and I worked night shift at the time. My roommates were getting ready for work and I was already ready so I sat in a chair and nodded off for about 10 minutes. They were still getting ready, when I stood up, walked up to my roommate and stared at her. Her husband said ""yo bro, you ok?"" and it was then I woke up, the whole time this was happening I could see them but it was like my vision was very shaky. When I woke up after he asked if I was ok my heart was pounding FAST, and I looked down and my hands were in fists and were shaking really bad and I had an adrenaline rush...

And this brings me to the next section of my story. Me and my friends were messing around with a ouija board, finally got it to work but it really was half-garbled messages and stuff, and soon we thought of a another better way to communicate. I won't say how because I don't want anyone else to do this ever. For one, we got VERY lucky during communication and two its very very dangerous. I would HIGHLY advise against using ouija boards or any other form of spirit communication, I know you are curious but try hard to not to it. The information we got was both frightening and comforting.

I know you as the reader are of course skeptical of my story and any story you see on here, but Ive read stories that, with the information I have now I can say ""yes that's definitely true"" or read replies answering people asking for help and think to my self ""yes that person has experience and it will help...""

Some of the things we discovered were, yes, demons are FREAKING real, yes they are and they will try to cut in on ANY spirit communication you have. Two, anyone who is into new age wicca stuff is COMPLETELY wrong, please please please do not listen to them, crystals, salts and all that will NOT help you, you might end up getting into serious trouble listening to them. One of the things I asked the spirits was, if I was being possessed when I slept walk, and they said yes. They told me the name of the demon and everything and told me I would hurt someone. I asked how I can be rid of this demon and I got a very clear message, it said to me ""jesus and love"".

Keep in mind dear reader I am not christian and in fact up to that point I was very anti-christian, I thought christians believed in some middle east myth much like the greek gods and tried hard to push their man made book born mythology onto the rest of us. But when demons tried to interfere with the communication, I used his name and they were scared, it would clear communication up enough for us to get straight answers for a bit. But I want to share with you, and anyone suffering from fear, sleep possession, demon harassment, hauntings, and any would be ouija bored or automatic writer the things I've learned from the communications.

1. Demons are real, the other side is real, and you have spirit guides. Angels are real as well.

2. Rituals don't work, almost not at all, there are two I know of that do, and I will only tell you one, called the family ritual, where the family (blood family only) meet and ask thankfulness from god.

3. Jesus and love are the only things that can save you from demons. Demons hate. They are here from hate, and they want you because they hate. They want two things, they either want to control you or they want you to cut your time here short (die). Demons like to attack in your sleep or when you are otherwise in a vulnerable state. If you suffer from this just try this, just say ""in jesus's name begone"" and it will work.

4. Spirit guides CANNOT read your mind, angels and demons can.

6. The torah is the most accurate version of the bible. The new testament not very accurate.

7. Demons can and will try to jump on the chance to take over and possess during stuff like automatic writing and ouija communication, BEWARE and remember jesus.

8. Demons DO use backwards speech. If you ever get a message in any for that says something backwards, immediately ask the spirit, ""do you love jesus?"" a demon cannot say yes, they can lie about all kinds of stuff but they can't lie about that. Also if you ever see a spirit, it will appear as a SHADOWY FIGURE, mentioned a lot in most ghost stories, beware, shadows are NOT good, EVER.

9. During any spirit communication, constantly verify stuff with jesus name and love and make sure a demon is not cutting in trying to cause harm.

10. If you have trouble at any time, remember, jesus is there for you, and michael the archangel is there for you. Michael can be in more then one place at a time, ask him to banish evil spirits wanting to do you harm and he will help, and jesus will help.

I know I am sounding preachy and talking about jesus a lot, but, I once hated him and when I needed him he was there for me. I no longer sleep walk, I am no longer scared when I'm alone or I sit in the dark. I can live my life now and not have to worry about spirit stuff anymore.

If you are being harassed by something unknown remember what I wrote here, it will help. I have also learned through communications that, most ghost hunters, demonologists, psychic investigators and super devout religious people don't know squat about ghosts, spirits and demons.

If you have any questions on that kind of stuff, send me an email, I'll try my best to answer or find out for you. Just before careful. Once you know you can't go back, and its a scary road.

Heavy Angry Breathing,"Oklahoma, United States",Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: Heavy Angry Breathing

I was fairly young at the time, but it was frightening enough that I did not forget. My mother was in the kitchen, perhaps doing dishes or cleaning something, and my brother and I were in the living room. I was playing in the living room with some toys, and decided I wanted to get something from my bedroom.

I vividly remember walking into my room and looking around on the floor. The floor was a bit messy. There was enough light coming in from the open door for me to see so I did not bother to turn the light on. In all honestly I do not remember what I went to get as I never retrieved it. A few seconds to a minute after entering the room, I felt a presence and a heard a very loud breathing right next to me. The breathing sounded extremely angry, evil, loud, and clear yet I saw no one there.

I was immediately frightened, but at the same time in total disbelief that I was hearing this. I froze and stood still for a second telling myself that I was imagining this. I had to be. After trying to convince myself that it was my imagination the breathing did not stop, so I ran as fast as I could run to where my mother was. I curled up on the floor at her feet screaming, ""PLEASE PRAY MOM! PLEASE PRAY! THERE IS SOMETHING EVIL IN THIS HOUSE!""

Recently I was watching a you-tube entitled Ghosts, Spirits, and Demons! which my son pointed out to me. About midway through there is a clip of a camera on a tripod filming in a dining area. Some furniture and things are shuffled around, a door opens and closes, but what really scared me was when I turned up the volume and I heard a heavy angry breathing in that video which sounded exactly as I heard as a child. I never finished watching that video after hearing that.

I noticed there is a link to that same video on this site. Perhaps some of you can go watch it. Turn up the sound on the part where the camera is on the tripod. You will clearly hear this very same sound I heard in that room.

The Mist of Ward Essex,Australia,Photographs / Videos / EVP,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Photographs / Videos / EVP :: The Mist of Ward Essex

T hose of you who are familiar with my posts may know me to be a somewhat skeptical person of the supernatural, especially when it comes to supposed photographic evidence. So you will appreciate the irony of what I am about to show you.

Some weeks before my encounter I was informed by a friend and fellow supernatural enthusiast of the ghostly figure of a woman that was said to haunt the corner of Ward St and Essex Rd ( Indooroopilly, Brisbane, Queensland, Australia ). Unfortunately, he wasn't able to provide a more detailed description, not having witnessed this ghost first-hand.

Coincidentally (or perhaps not I thought) this just so happened to be near where I live. Having lived in the area for some fourteen years and never having seen or heard anything of a ghost in the area, I was at first skeptical never-the-less, I intended to check it out as it seemed like a pretty good excuse to go ghost hunting.

The few weeks following I was far too busy with uni to give ghost hunting any further thought. It's only now during the Easter break that I've had the chance to do my own investigation.

The following is my account of the events that occurred on the night of Sunday the 23rd of March, 2008:

Armed with my camera, I left the house at roughly 8.00pm. The corner of Ward and Essex wasn't far so I went on foot (I have included a photo of the area with the roads marked). My intention was to observe the area over the next hour, keeping an eye out for anything out of the ordinary and if possible, photograph it.

I took a few test photos with my camera and to my dismay, found that it wasn't well suited to taking photos at night. The only way I could get a decent shot at range was to use an eight second exposure (this was how the aforementioned shot of the area was taken). While the camera did have a flash, it was only practical for short to medium distances. If I did see anything unusual, I would need to be close to it to produce any sort of descent shot.

After about half an hour, I noticed what appeared to be a small but bright light dancing in the garden of the house on the very corner of Ward St and Essex Rd (I have marked this on the photo). Intrigued, I quickly crossed the road for a closer look. What I saw was unlike anything I have ever experienced.

As I approached, the light darted out from the garden. Up closer it appeared to be more of a fluorescent white mist. It darted back and forth rapidly and seemingly randomly for a matter of seconds, during which time I was able to take three photos before it took off at a terrific speed, flying almost directly over my head and disappearing into the night sky. I distinctly recall a chilling sensation as it flew over me, as if it was sucking the warmth right out of me.

I have included the three photos I took. The third one (of the mist as it flew over me) I find particularly interesting as it looks as if the mist is made up of many small orbs. However, this may be a trick of the light in relation to the camera lens.

I fully intend to revisit the site at a later date, hopefully with some better equipment and perhaps with the aid of a more experienced ghost hunter.

Please take a look at my photos and let me know what you think.

The Black Shape in the Dark,"Arizona, United States",Old Hags / Night Attacks / Sleep Paralysis,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Old Hags / Night Attacks / Sleep Paralysis :: The Black Shape in the Dark

I would like to start this story off by explaining a little bit about myself and my background. I was born and raised in Tucson, AZ and spent my entire childhood in one house until middle school when my family moved into an older but nicer house. My parents are very religious and I was raised to be the same. Looking back at my childhood I think I have always been a little more sensitive to the paranormal than most but my parents always explained it away as an overactive imagination or ""spiritual"" attacks. These explanations worked for a long time until the night this story takes place.

About the time I was entering middle school my fathers job was doing very well and we moved out of the little sub-division house into a larger custom house. This house was at least 20 years old but had only had two owners. The older couple we bought the house from were very nice but a little bit ""off"". Nothing too weird mind you just a little bit strange. My parents didn't see it but as soon as I step into the house for the first time I just felt that something wasn't right.

Nothing too unusual, besides this slight un-easy feeling, happened for a couple years until I was a freshman in High School. The old lady that used to live in the house had some ailment that inhibited her ability to walk very well. The one time I saw her, she was walking across the carpeted living room and her feet kind of made this ""scooting"" sound as she walked, because she couldn't lift her feet.

One night during my freshmen year of high school I was up late writing a paper when at about three in the morning, I heard these scooting footsteps crossing the living room. I jumped up and turned on the light and searched the house from one end to the other and found nothing; my family being asleep in the rooms at the far end of the house. To say the least this experience was un-nerving and ended my homework for the night and I went to my room and locked the door and tried to get some sleep.

The next morning, like many people do I suspect, I blew it all off and decided that it was the result of too many hours in front of a computer and not enough sleep. None the less, the next night I didn't spend any time out in the living room after the rest of my family went to bed. My room at the time was little more than a large walk-in closet that the previous owners used as a small work room and for storage. It was in the far end of the house from the other bedrooms and it had no window and only the one door that lead to the hallway to the garage. During the day, with the door shut, this room was as dark as a cave; absolutely no light got in. At night I had to leave the door open just to let what ambient light I could from the dark hallway in order to find my way out of my room if need be.

Due to the previous night's experience I was a little un-easy about the dark but fell asleep pretty quickly anyway. I have no idea what time it was or what woke me up, but suddenly I was wide awake and alert. I did not move a muscle but lay there trying to figure out exactly what had woke me up and if it would happen again.

Nothing extraordinary happened and so I got up to check out the rest of the house. However, as I turned toward the door, this feeling of absolute danger and evil hit me. I look towards the door and somehow silhouetted against the very faint light coming through the doorway, was a huge figure. I'm 6'2"" and 200 lbs of muscle and this shape was at least a foot and a half taller and much wider than I was and from this figure radiated such hate and what I can only describe as evil. The temperature of the room went from cool to absolute freezing and I felt something hit me very hard in the chest and my throat seemed to close. I literally felt like someone was kneeling on my chest and strangling me. I thought that I was going to die, killed by something that I couldn't fight or see.

I can not tell you how long this lasted or what caused it to stop but just as I thought I would black out and die, the weight lifted from my chest and my throat and I could breath again. I could feel that whatever had been there was gone and I was alone again and my room was a absolute mess from my struggle and it was its usual temperature. As soon as I could I turned the light on and all the lights in the hall, kitchen, and living room.

The only sign that anything had happened was the mess in my room and a very slight red ring around my neck. The next morning I told my parents about it and they just passed it off with the usual reasons that it was all in my head or I was dreaming. I know I was not asleep and I am not crazy. It really happened and there was no way I would ever sleep in that room again.

Now I am and was a big guy and I am not afraid of anything ""living"" on this planet but that night I was absolutely filled with terror and not for my life but whatever it was it felt like it wanted more than just my life. I don't understand what it could have been but it only happened that one night and as far as I can tell the whatever was in that house returned to complete rest after that.

I have many more stories about different places and completely different situation but I thought since this is my first story and my first experience that I would just judge by the responses I get whether I will continue to post more experiences. I am really busy but I will try and participate as much as I can with any comments I get.

A Feeling of Sadness,"Tennessee, United States",Psychic / Medium,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Psychic / Medium :: A Feeling of Sadness

F irst let me give some history. My family has always had what you would call psychic abilities, we feel others emotions or know things that most people would never pick up on. I guess it has something to do with our heritage, my Grandmother on my dad's side is Cherokee with some Scottish thrown in, on my mom's side we have Sioux and Irish. Needless to say, with that kind of mix, we have a wide variety of psychic tricks in our family.

I had told my husband about some of my experiences and he had come to the conclusion that, while I truly believed in what I could feel or pick up, it did not necessarily follow that it was real.

My husband grew up in an old, old house, generations of the family had lived there. Some of you are familiar with stories of the old home place since he has written several stories about it and you know that he was sort of a foster child there. His aunt and uncle took him in when he was about six years old but the generations before were not his actual ancestors so he did not talk about them very much.

This particular incident took place early fall 2007. We had gone up to visit his sister who is presently living there in the old home place, and since I love old houses, I told Frank (Frawin) that I would like to see the upstairs of the old house. We went up a narrow staircase and into this big old fashioned room that was filled with old toys, whatnots, figurines, books, old trunks and two or three beds. It was the kind of room you could poke around in for hours.

We had only been up there for a few minutes when I started feeling it. There was an overwhelming sadness in the room, almost a feeling of despair. I started to cry and Frank asked me what was wrong, I opened my mouth to tell him nothing was wrong but what actually came out was ""the baby died"" then I just started sobbing and Frank had to take me back downstairs.

When I finally got myself under control and got the stuff in my head sorted out I told frank that what I had felt was from a woman who had lost one of her new babies and that part of the grief I was feeling from her was that she didn't have time to grieve for him because she had another baby and older kids and that she had to take care of and couldn't take the time to grieve.

Frank told me later that the woman was his foster father's mother and that she had given birth to triplet boys and that one had died about a month later but she had two babies left that had to be taken care of. She lost another of the triplets when he was a toddler but the last of them lived to a ripe old age.

Frank was kind of shocked because this woman was not related to him so he had never talked about her to me. All the time before this when I talked about my paranormal experiences Frank knew that I believed I was having real experiences but now he knew it was real too.

Forsyth in Shadows,"Georgia, United States",Psychic / Medium,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Psychic / Medium :: Forsyth in Shadows

W hen I was 7 I lived in Forsyth Ga with my older sister Sarah and my Mother Jan. Being the youngest of four (and now youngest of 5) no one much listened to me much or believed any of my strange stories. Ever since I was young, strange things would happen to me, no matter where I was. My mother saw this but to keep the peace in house full of children, I was urged to keep them to myself.

I had always been the one with the tough outer skin, but very sensitive ""spirit wise"" on the inside. Maybe that's why none of my other brothers or sisters never really shared their experiences with me. Or maybe, as I was told, they were also sworn to secrecy.

One day after school my sister Sarah and I had just gotten off the bus from school. She was had just turned 10 and I was 7. My other siblings (coming from a home with divorced parents) had already moved away to live with my Dad and stepmother. Mom was at work and we were mature for our age. Able to take our baths and cook small things and do our homework. So it was just another normal day of Sarah and I again. Mom always left the door unlocked under the garage for us, but this particular afternoon, it was locked for some odd reason. We had to run to the neighbors, call mom at work and see where the spare key was.

After finding the key we went inside. I threw my things down by the door and Sarah went to her her room, I can't remember why. I had my back to her room and was walking into the kitchen when I heard foot steps behind me. Soft and slow at first, then growing louder, faster, and nearer. I thought it was just Sarah at first, but I knew, as I began to run that it wasn't her chasing me. I could hear and even FEEL a heavy breathing down my neck. Chills flew down my spine.

When I couldn't run any longer (I had reached the far wall) I collapsed and shrieked and crumpled on the floor with my hands covering my head in sheer terror.

I heard my sister call my name and heard her running from her room. She had been in there the whole time. Nowhere near me or the kitchen. She asked me what was wrong. I told her nothing, that I fell.

Another experience was around the time of my birthday. My oldest sister Misty came to visit and bought me one of those little princess tiara and earrings sets. I loved it so much. Especially the earrings because of what a beautiful blue they were. (my favorite color). I cherished them and kept them in a small glass jewelry box that had a small lock and key (another present from my late grandfather).

I could hear things in the night always. Breathing, footsteps, whispering, knocking, the bathroom door outside my room opening and shutting. (It creaked very loudly) So, naturally, I still had a night light.

One night while I was asleep, I suddenly remember waking for no reason at all. And looking along my wall. There was a shadow there. The perfect silhouette of a human person. I thought it was mom at first so I wasn't frightened until it began to move and there was no mom (no one actually) creating the shadow.

I noticed, even at the young age of seven that it didn't follow the laws of nature or light. It didn't bend with the walls, it didn't move or fade no matter which way it was to the light, even at the corners it stayed the same shape and color and I remember the heavy breathing. I don't really know what happened then. I might have just gone back to sleep or passed out. But when I woke the next morning, my earrings were gone, but my box was still shut and locked. I asked everyone if they had been in my room that night. No one had.

One last thing, then I'll stop typing so much, I promise. One day I was in the living room alone while Sarah was outside playing. I can clearly remember watching sailor Moon and eating peanut butter. Ha ha. When, from the corner of my eye a girl came and sat down beside me. I knew she was there, but didn't think much of it. She had dark hair, but I couldn't tell about any other features really, except she was wearing a pink and white floral dress from what looked like the early 80's. It did not bother me one bit, she came off peaceful and I paid her no mind...

She was still there until I turned my full attention to her and she was just gone. Sad to say I ran out of the house and sat in the driveway with Sarah until Mom came home.

Uncle Roy's House,"Massachusetts, United States",Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: Uncle Roy's House

I n the mid-1970s my Uncle and his family purchased an old house located outside of Boston in a town called Newtonville. Although I don't remember the exact date the house was built, I know it was around the late 1700s. The date had been painted in black on the chimney as most of the houses in this historical neighborhood were. It had two staircases; the first being in the front of the house and the second in the back. The one in the front was very narrow and steep.

We would visit my Uncle on occasion and there was something about this house that I, as a child, just was uncomfortable with but could never put my finger on.

My Aunt and Uncle helped out with the Boston Ballet at the time. Both my cousins were ballerinas, which for an 8 year old girl was the coolest thing ever. They invited me to come to a performance of Sleeping Beauty one Friday night in November. I was then going to spend the night with the younger of my two cousins, who was 11 at the time. Although I wasn't thrilled with sleeping at the old house, the opportunity to be at the ballet and with my much cooler older cousin was much too good to pass up.

That night I dressed in my best dress and headed to the Wang Theater with my Uncle, Aunt, and cousin. I got to go back stage with them and witness the dancers getting ready. I was in awe. After the performance and then dinner, we headed back to the house. My cousin and I changed into our nightgowns and got ready for bed.

I remembered I had to go ask my Uncle something so I headed down the back staircase into the living room. It was dark and very cold downstairs, with a little light coming in from the upper hallway. Once I realized I was alone in the living room. I turned to head back up the stairs. Off of the living room was an alcove that contained a grand piano. All of the sudden I started to hear what sounded like a man moaning. I froze in my tracks. Thinking it was my Uncle trying to scare me (as he knew his home gave me the creeps), I whispered, ""Uncle Roy?"" The moaning continued.

At this point my eyes had adjusted to what little light there was. I leaned down to see if my Uncle was hiding behind the piano, intent on catching him trying to scare me. There was no one there. Then I heard my Uncle upstairs in his bedroom speaking to my Aunt. I completely froze in sheer terror. If my Uncle is upstairs then who or what is behind the piano?! Finally I mustered up the courage to go up the stairs. I don't think my feet even touched the ground. I told my Uncle what had just happened and he did not believe me. I did not speak about this again until a few years later, in fear of being ridiculed.

A few years passed and my Uncle and his family moved out of that house. I asked him if he remembered what had happened the night I joined them at the Ballet. He said he did, and that he definitely felt now that the house they had been living in was haunted. He relayed the following story...

There were times when objects in the house would disappear only to reappear in other places. There were odd noises at night and the attic door in my cousin's room would be closed at night, only to be found open in the morning. Then my Aunt and Uncle made a terrible decision. They decided to use a ouija board to contact whatever spirit might be in the house.

They started off by asking a few questions like, who are you? Did you used to live here? Then the planchette kept moving to ""Good-bye..."" My Uncle kept pushing with the questions. Apparently this ticked off whatever was there. The room became extremely cold and the air turned heavy and oppressive. Suddenly their German shephard dog, who was outside at the time, began to howl. In fear of waking the neighbors as it was pretty late, they dragged the poor dog into the house. They sat in bed and read the Bible until the early morning hours when the bad feeling finally went away. They never messed with a ouija board again and advised me to stay away from it if I were ever tempted.

Once in a great while I'll run into my Uncle at a family gathering if I'm back east and this story always comes up. He still reminds me to stay away from the ouija board. I'd have to say that is pretty sound advice!

Are You Ready?,"Georgia, United States",Apparitions / Voices / Touches,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Apparitions / Voices / Touches :: Are You Ready?

I was laying in bed one night when I was 7 (which seemed to be the peek of when I experienced paranormal phenomena) tossing and turning, completely unable to sleep. I rolled onto my stomach, covers half off my little body.

Just as I was beginning to doze off, I felt someone sitting on the end of my bed and heard it creaking. I assumed it was (again) my Mother coming to check on me like she frequently did.

I called out to her, but she never answered. I felt the pressure of what I assume to be a hand on my back. Then I could feel her leaning down next to my face. The soft voice was not that of my mother's.

""Are you ready?"" She said. It as female, no doubt, but NOT Mom at all.

In fear I wretched the covers over my head, too afraid to move anymore and drifted off to sleep sometime later.

I asked my mother if it was her who had come into my room and said that, but she said no, then asked me what it said. I told her it asked me if I was ready. Ready for what we didn't know.

Sure enough the following Sunday... My Grandfather (who I was very close to) died in his sleep in his favorite arm chair. I never even got to say goodbye.

I guess my guardian angel was just trying to prepare and warn me.

A Collection of Strange Encounters,United Kingdom,Misc,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Misc :: A Collection of Strange Encounters

A lthough this collection is small, the events happened and I thought it would be pointless to publish them separately, so I put them into one post. The first encounter that I had was at my grandparents house in Birchington, Kent, England. I was about 9/10 years old at the time. It was a party, I can't remember what, may have been New Year celebrations, but I was sitting in the hallway when I caught something in the corner of my eye - a strange white mist floated past the front door.

I sat there frightened. I wanted to tell someone, but all the adults were in conversations, so I went up to the door, didn't open it, but waited to see if it came past again. It didn't. About 5 minutes later, the house went quiet to a large growling and barking outside the backdoor. It sounded like a large vicious dog waiting to be let in. My uncle rushed to the door, flung it open, but it was deathly still outside - A pin drop would have been heard. I was in the kitchen, which led to the door, at the time and I recall seeing a silhouette at the door at the moment of the barking. It hasn't been seen or heard to this day.

The second encounter came about a month or so after my grandfather's death, in May 2006, at my home in Welwyn Garden City, England. It was 2 weeks before my 14th birthday, and the night before his funeral. I was discussing it with my brother upstairs in his bedroom before he went to bed, to settle his nerves and concerns, when the radio turned on by itself and it was playing ""You'll Never Walk Alone"". This frightened the life out of my brother and I, but I became relaxed, because I knew my granddad was telling me that there was nothing to worry about and he would always be around.

The third encounter I am writing about is very fresh in memory because it happened last night. It was 2:00 AM, and I was working on some coursework in my bed, and I fell asleep. What happened next had me very confused when I woke up four hours 3 hours later. I had fallen asleep with my laptop on, never a wise thing to do, but when I awoke, I found it to be neatly placed on the desk next to my bed. I didn't think at first how it got there, only thinking about the work that I had left. I was dead scared that it hadn't been saved, but to my surprise, was saved. I was in shock. My parents had gone to bed before me and they didn't wake until 7:00 AM. What had gone on that night? One word came to mind. Granddad

Memories of Brian,"Massachusetts, United States",Family / Friends Visits,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Family / Friends Visits :: Memories of Brian

B rian was the son of my Godmother. Although we weren't related by blood, we considered each other cousins. He was three years younger than myself and was one of the most wonderful people I have met in this lifetime. I was 21 years old in the late 1980s and I was visiting my younger sister who was attending Salem State College at the time. This was the weekend before Thanksgiving.

During that visit, my Mom called us to let us know that Brian had been killed the night before in a horrible car accident in Virginia. He was only 18. I walked around in a state of shock and was inconsolable for a long time to come. He was the first person I knew even close to my age that had passed away and I took it extremely hard.

During the short Thanksgiving week I would leave work on my lunch break and go over to a nearby church to pray or just think. On one of those occasions I asked Brian to ask God for a little snow for Christmas that year. We always anticipated the first snow fall and this was a very dry year for us so far. I forgot about this request and went on trying to get back to normal while still mourning his loss.

A few weeks before Christmas I was driving home from a babysitting job when I got to thinking about Brian. I cried all the way home. I drove to the top of the driveway where our house sat on a hill and cried some more. Something on the windshield suddenly had caught my eye. Flakes of snow were falling on my windshield and melting. I stopped crying and watched them come down and slowly melt into beads of water. I remembered my request at the church but did not think the two were related. That is until I stepped out of the car.

I stared up at the sky expecting to look up and see more snow falling and what I saw shocked me. It was a beautiful cloudless night with a million stars shining in the sky. The bare trees moved in the breeze. I stood there with my mouth open. Where did the snow come from? What had I just seen? My Mom drove up the driveway just then and asked me what I was doing. I told her what had happened and she just nodded her head. I don't know if she believed me or not but I didn't push it. We entered the house and she asked me if I was alright. I started to cry again.

From upstairs I could hear my Dad yelling for either myself or my Mom to come upstairs quick. I ran up to my parent's bedroom only to find my Dad kneeling in front of the large picture window as if in prayer. ""Come here, you have to see this,"" he said, waving me towards him. I had no idea what he was looking at and I suddenly felt frightened.

I knelt down next to him and he pointed out the window to the sky. ""Keep watching the sky,"" he said. I did and seconds later a glowing green chunk dropped from the sky and burnt out as it neared the earth. We were witnessing a meteor shower. This was followed by several shooting stars. I don't know if this is related to the snow on the windshield or not but I had this overwhelming feeling that God, a greater power, or something understood my grief and I was not alone. I wanted to run to my room and throw the covers over my head. It was such a very powerful feeling.

The following summer my family had planned to rent a beach house for a week on the Maine coast. This was a yearly vacation and Brian had been present for this vacation most years. I remember him arriving at our house with either his surf board or boogie board in tow. He was what you would think of when you pictured a typical surfer boy; tan skin, sun-bleached hair, and Ocean Pacific clothing.

I was dreading this vacation because of the hole his death had left in my life. At the time I had just taken a new job working as a sales person and was constantly traveling. I was in an area that had a shop where you could get your tarot cards read. I felt this pull to go in. The reader started to tell me different things about my life and about the future when she suddenly stopped. She looked at me and asked if I had recently lost a brother or a cousin in a car accident. I asked her how she knew that. She said he kept coming up in the cards. I burst into tears. I was really embarrassed to be crying in front of this woman but I couldn't help it. She said that he didn't want me to be sad anymore and that I needed to stop crying because he was okay. I spent the rest of the day in shock.

A few weeks later I dreamt of Brian. He asked me why I was crying. I said it was because I would never see him again. He looked at me as if to say, ""you know better than that..."" Then he had to go.

On the morning of my wedding in April of 2006, I felt him near me. I took this as a sign that he was happy for me and approved of who I was marrying. My Godmother flew out to be at my wedding and when I told her that I felt her son near, she said she felt him as well.

A few weeks ago I was searching through the garage for pictures to include in my story "" The Spirits of Goodale Cemetery ,"" when I came across a picture that was taken many years ago while on vacation on the coast of Maine. My sisters, Brian, and I would always meet other kids our age also vacationing with their families. It was the last day of our vacation and we had decided to take a picture of us all before we left. Someone thought it would be a neat idea to build a human pyramid.

Brian, being the lightest of all us, had the job of being at the top. There in the picture of that wind swept beach, with smiles on our tanned faces, was Brian; his sun-bleached hair toussled in the breeze, and one hand raised up towards heaven. This is how I will forever remember him. Rest in peace my friend.

Soda Can Whacked Off the Cabinet,"Maine, United States",Poltergeists / Physical Manifestations,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Poltergeists / Physical Manifestations :: Soda Can Whacked Off the Cabinet

I live in my grandmother's old house. It's an older house, though not terribly old. My grandfather bought it unfinished, and finished it on his own. My uncle swears up and down the house is haunted. He's spoken of kitchen cabinets opening and closing, and things of that nature. I am a skeptic, so I never took his words TOO seriously. (Okay, I might have when I was a child, but as an adult, I've always been a skeptic regarding paranormal things.)

In any case, after my grandmother passed away, my family had the opportunity to rent the house from my father. My husband and I and our three children moved in with no problems. I'd forgotten completely about the supposed haunting of the house until one summer day a few weeks after we'd moved in.

I had been busy during the morning, and decided to take a break. I grabbed a can of Pepsi and went into the living room. I sat in my grandmother's old favorite chair in the corner of the room, cracked open the soda and a book, and relaxed, enjoying the peace and quiet. (My husband had taken the kids out, so I had the place to myself.) It was pleasantly cool and I was thoroughly enjoying myself. I put the soda can down on a small cabinet next to the chair and started in on my book.

All of a sudden, my soda can took flight and slammed against the wall, spilling all over the place. I looked up in shock and saw nothing, and heard nothing. No one was there. Yet if I didn't know better, I'd say someone had deliberately whacked my can of Pepsi off the cabinet and against the wall.

I haven't noticed anything else strange happen in this house since that one incident (and we've lived here for about two years now.) I still have absolutely no idea what caused my drink to be hurled from the cabinet, but it's enough to make a skeptic... Well, skeptical.

Trailer #350,"Michigan, United States",Psychic / Medium,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Psychic / Medium :: Trailer #350

T his took place in the 1980's in the run down trailer court my sons and I lived in. Cheryl my friend from the park, her and I would often walk around the trailer court at night time. Usually it was in the summer time and was too hot in our trailers and cooler outside. We walked pass trailer 350 many times in the years I lived in that place.

But one night as we passed by that trailer, I told Cheryl ""Something bad has happen or is going to happen in that trailer"". So while we are walking around. Cheryl said ""lets go tell the manager, maybe something is going on in that trailer"". So we did tell the manager. She got a couple of guys near her (the ones that helped her run the place) and they took a walk to trailer 350. They knocked on the door, a lady came to the door, she was asked if anything was wrong, she said no. So the manager and her dudes left. Cheryl and I just kept walking around the trailer park.

From that one night forward, even when we walked in the day time hours around the park, I felt that something was not right with that trailer. Again and again we tell the park manager and again she and some guys go there and check it out. And again nothing was going on. Finally came a time when we tell the park manager, that something was not right with the trailer, that she didn't bother to investigate anymore.

One night late in the summer, as Cheryl and I walked by the trailer #350, I said ""did you see her?"". Cheryl asked me who? I said the lady in the window. She said she didn't see anyone in the window. So we walked around again. Came to the trailer, I said ""Look she is in the window now"". Cheryl tells me I am seeing things. We stopped right in front of the trailer, we both looked at the window, I seen a lady looking sad out of it, she seen nothing.

Winter came upon us, and we didn't walk as much around the park anymore. However we did and I would say ""Cheryl something is not right with this trailer"". She finally told me to stop that, I was making her frighten. Her trailer was just two from this one. I was five trailers away from this one. We do our walking and I didn't say anything to Cheryl anymore, but still felt something wrong with trailer number 350. When I see the park manager, sometimes on our walks in the park, I tell her something is wrong with trailer #350. She just tell me ""okay I will look into it"". But Cheryl and I knew she didn't bother.

Spring came around, and our walks continued more often. One night into the summer I said to Cheryl ""Do you smell that?"" She tells me no. I said there is an odor coming out of trailer 350. She told me not to tell the park manager, she would not look into it anymore. I told her I knew that. She thought I made it up.

I had to pass the trailer, to go to the other end, and get my son off the bus. I stood in front of the window of the trailer, there was that lady, looking at me with sad eyes. When I looked away and then back again, she wasn't there. I told Cheryl about this, and she told me to stop thinking that way.

Some days later as I had all my windows open, I had to close them up. My trailer was starting to smell like trailer number 350. I asked the two neighbors on each side of the trailer, if they smelled something awful from the trailer. They told me they couldn't open there windows anymore due to the smell. So the two neighbors and I went nearer to the trailer. Oh my gosh the smell took our breath away. I got sick, one gal threw up, the other ran home. I asked the gal with me ""What do you think that is?"" she said ""It smells like something dead"". I said yes I think so.

We went to the park managers house, told her what we smelled from that trailer. She said to me ""Okay not again, I thought you gave up on that"". I said it's not only me it's two other people who smells this. Come to find out, it wasn't only me that smelled this, others besides the neighbors on both sides smelled it too.

We followed the park manager to trailer number 350. She knocked no answer. She had one of her dudes knock the door down. Oh my gosh I was so sick, everyone had to cover their noses up. The smell that came out of that trailer was horrible. Her and the two dudes with her went in. We can hear them coughing and gagging. They came out all white, and breathing hard.

In the trailer, near the door they found a dead woman, it appeared she had an abortion and bled to death by the door. In the back bedroom was where abortions were taking place. Under some mattresses was many fetuses in different stages of their life. Some were pretty big babies, that could of lived, but instead were left to die.

The police came and did an investigating into this, they found more then 50 fetuses under the mattresses. Lots of dried up blood. The dead woman who appeared to have bled to death. The trailer was in danger of contaminating all of us who lived in the park. It was hauled away, many pictures taken of the trailer and the contents on the inside. It was hauled off some place and burned, after all the finger prints and stuff was done on it... The police circulated the picture of the woman they found in the park. Her finger prints were filed away and so were her toe prints. I had to see what she looked like.

When I seen the picture of what she had looked like, before this was done to her (as the police had someone, draw a sketch of her before her death), I got faint feeling. I had to sit down. I said ""I seen her in the window, I seen her in the window"". She had a mark on her left cheek, a bruise, a birth mark some kind of mark, looked like a half moon shape

When this happen, I went to my house, sat on the steps and shook so bad, I kept throwing up. I had a major headache, stomach ache and weak feeling. Had a major panic attack. Cheryl came home, she seen me on the porch and asked what was going on. I tried to tell her the best that I could. ""OH NO"" she said you knew this was going to happen. I told her I didn't know this was what was going to happen. I just knew something was happening in this trailer. I felt it was going on, even when it was looked into, by the park manager. Just it didn't stink then, so no one thought anything of it.

I told them (the police) I seen her in the window, but I could tell they didn't believe me, especially when they asked Cheryl and she didn't see any woman. Sometime later the police told our park manager that the woman that was found dead, did bleed to death, and had been dead a long time. When I first seen her, I now felt she was either near death, or had just died, and was trying to get help in some way. To draw attention to the trailer to be looked into. She made it from the back bedroom to the front door, where she may have been to weak to go any further. Sometime after this too, we read where many woman who had  had abortions were found in dumpsters, in alleys, in deserted houses, that were put in the papers. And the police did find a guy that was involved with these, but he got away. Hmmm sounded fishy to me. It always made me think why did they let him get away.

This park had prostitute's, pimps, drug dealers in it. Shootings went on, on a monthly basis, people were killed and no one seemed to care. Kids were ran over by people on drugs. Drunks beat their wives and kids up. Perverts were around the corners, peeping toms, sex crazed men grabbing the innocent kids and dragging them to the woods to rape them or molest them. People would shoot and kill animals for the fun of it, take them (the dead animals) to the woods and cut them open. Teens had sex in the day time, in the field across from my trailer.

The guy across the street from me held drug parties every night. Little kids would find the syringes in the day time, and take them home to their moms. Lots of break ins. You would hear shooting all hours of the day or night. I think there were more roaches (bugs) and guns in the trailer court then there was kids. They (teenagers) often ran around the park naked. I never heard anyone dying of a stab wound, just bullets.

My one son, I and Merry we often seen animals that were cut up, wondering around the park. Only to discover, when we went to help them, they disappear in front of our eyes.

I had no other place to live at the time. My children and I lived there for several more years, after this happen. Finally I had enough saved to flee from that hell hole. Moved to a wonderful country home, where we were always safe. The trailer court still is in that city, but has moved from the 3rd worse trailer park in that county to the #1 place now. More people have been killed. Their trailers all shot up, like Wanita's was the day her son was killed.

Other people would move their trailers on that lot, and soon they moved them else where. I never seen a trailer stay on that lot more then a couple of months, before it was moved elsewhere. When Cheryl and I would walk by that empty lot, I always got the shivers even when it was really hot outside. Merry (not real name) said she often heard a baby cry, thinking it was her own. When she check on her baby, her baby was sleeping. Her trailer sat next to this one, with the abortions done in it. I never heard a baby cry.

Cheryl and I often use to talk about, the feelings I had before this happen. The park manager just thought I was making stuff up, that was until she found out what, was going on in that park she managed and in trailer #350.

And NO, NO, NO, don't anyone ask me to go back, and to see what is happening on that lot now. I would have to go back fully armed, with bullet proof from head to toe, and a machine gun in a tank, in order to get me back into that park again.

Skeleton Apparition,"District of Columbia, United States",Apparitions / Voices / Touches,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Apparitions / Voices / Touches :: Skeleton Apparition

M y first ghostly encounter I can remember was when I was about 6 or 7 years old. My mom, her boyfriend, my sister, and me had just moved into a house in Pleasantville, NJ. In the room me and my sister slept, there was an attic door. I felt very uneasy living in the house and especially uneasy sleeping in that room with the creepy attic.

I dozed off to sleep and around maybe 3 or 4 in the morning I awoke and saw the attic door open. I tried to wake my sister, who was sleeping beside me in the same bed, to get up and close the door. She would not move at all. All of a sudden I saw something move in the corner of my eye. The movement came from the left side of my vision, about 4 or 5 feet from the bed. It was very dark in the room, but the moon shone through the window and provided a little light.

At first I thought my eyes were playing tricks on me because of what I saw. I wiped my eyes, blinked, and pinched my arm to make sure I wasn't still asleep. What I saw almost made me pee on myself. Looking directly at me through empty eye sockets was a skeleton. It had on a black cape and the inside was blood red. I know how this sounds, but it is very true. I couldn't scream. I couldn't move, I was in shock and scared out of my mind. I closed my eyes and hid my head under the covers.

When I looked up it was still there, which really made me believe I wasn't dreaming. Finally I mustered up enough strength and ran out of the room. Leaving my sister and the ghostly figure (or what ever it was) behind. I ran to my mom and told her what happened.

Of course she didn't believe me, but stayed with me until I fell asleep. To this day I don't know what it was, which is why I am deeply interested in the paranormal.

Creepy Closet,"District of Columbia, United States",Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: Creepy Closet

W hen I was 13, I lived in my grandmother's house with my mom and my sister. The house was old (I'm not sure how old), and there was a furnace door across from my room. I came home from school one day and no one was there. I did my homework and laid on my bed to watch t.v. It was around 7 or 7:30, because Wheel of Fortune was on the t.v.

I heard a noise in the furnace room and opened the door to see what it was. I thought it was a mouse or something, but there was nothing in the furnace room, so I closed the door back. After about 10 or 15 minutes I heard it again and knew it was coming from that room.

All of a sudden the knob on the door started to turn. First it turned slowly and then it turned faster like someone was trying to open the door. I jumped off the bed and closed my door quickly. I did not want to see what was trying to get out of that room. After about 5 minutes of me closing my door, the furnace door flew open with so much force, it banged up against the hallway wall.

I put my nightstand up against my door and stayed there until my mom came. I did not tell her about that incident. I told my sister and she let me know that she had also had an encounter before my mine. She also informed me that she found a Ouija board and had been playing the game.

Man in a Trench Coat Staring at Me,Canada,Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: Man in a Trench Coat Staring at Me

A fter being considerably bored at work one day, I decided to google ghost stories (as I have personally seen and dealt with them before) and came across this site. I love reading the stories and it got me all jazzed up to tell mine.

It probably all started when I was 14 (I am now 24). My family and I were on a week long camping trip when my dog passed away. This dog that we had, (Max was his name) was the family dog but being at a young age when we got him, I became the closest to him. After I had learned that he died, I was so upset that my family had to cut the vacation short, just to get me home.

I had just moved in to a room in my parents basement, and it had no door to it. Now, where my bed was located, when looking out the door, you could see the furnace to the house. One night I woke up and grabbed a sip of water from a water bottle I always keep beside my bed and happened to look to the entrance of my room. Sitting in the doorway was my dog Max! Now, since this happened so long ago, I have constantly said to myself that this was a dream only because when I started calling Max to me, I remember specifically his eyes glowing red and him then jumping on my bed and trying to attack me! That ended up scaring the bejeezus out of me!

After the whole dog ""dream"" I have not seen Max since. Later when I would wake up/roll over, I would steal a look to the door and I would see a giant man, like a silhouette, standing in my door frame staring at me. To me, it looked like he was wearing a huge trench coat with some sort of hat with a huge brim. The first time this happened, I was so frightened that I dared not to stare at him too long as he would attack me like my dog. It became constant, like every night I would see him and for the first while it scared me to no ends but I became used to it and later when I would see him, I would just roll over, smile and go back to sleep.

One morning, after seeing the dude in my doorway the night before, I was speaking with my parents about a bad dream I had the night before. My mom chuckled as my dad also had a nightmare the same night and told me to go ask him about it. When I asked pops about his dream, he told me that he was dreaming about a guy who broke in to the house, made his way into my sisters room and ended up killing her. This woke him out of his sleep and when he looked out the hallway into the kitchen, he said he actually saw someone leave my sisters room (the two rooms are right beside each other that lead into a hall that leads into the kitchen) and walk into the kitchen. He said he got up and ran to the kitchen and when he flipped the light on, no one was there. It was then that I told him that I always see someone standing in my doorway every night and he just told me it was the furnace!

After I turned 18, I was still seeing this guy. My friends would spend the night and in the morning they would explain to me how they saw a guy standing in the middle of the room thinking it was me, and then explain what he looked like! That was when activity in the house started to pick up. My family and I would constantly see things out of the corner of our eyes, my mother one night told me about a ""floating person with a tiny smile on their face waving to her, loud unexplained noises followed up by things (one night it was all of our empty bottles lined up on our freezer, which I thought was hella cool) moving unexplained.

I feel I might be dragging this on, and I have a bit more to talk about so I think I will make a part two about my experiences in the future. Looking back to them I think things only get worse for me (nightmares with ghosts/demons) and we ended up getting the house blessed! But like I said, that will be another story!

Creepy Green House that Made Me a Bad Girl,"Texas, United States",Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: Creepy Green House that Made Me a Bad Girl

T his story takes place in little Ozona, Texas. We lived in this house in Aug. 2004 for only two weeks. The first time I set foot in that house, I got that strange feeling but just didn't think anything about it. Finally, we moved in. We set up everything in the house, and had our first supper of Fried Chicken on the living room floor.

We didn't real live like a family in this house. First of all, we all made our living room our big bedroom. I only fell asleep in my bedroom one time because there was a man in the doorway. Before I tell you anymore we had a newer and older part of this house. The newer part had the living room in it, and the older part had the Kitchen, Dining room, Three Bedrooms, and two baths.

This is the weird part. Four days after we moved in, I had to start 1st grade. All was fine for about a week, I liked my teacher and I was making new friends. The second week was a different story. I didn't want to go to school, I wouldn't let my new step dad take me anywhere, my mom always had to, but she was working days at the Care Center (6am to 6pm) so that was hard. This got so bad, the Principle had to walk me into school with me crying! I was acting like a evil little girl! That made my mom so scared! She missed her sweet Barbie playing girl.

After that second week, we found a trailer house because the person we rented the house from raised the rent. The day we started moving, I was as sweet as can be, and as we pulled away I couldn't believe my eyes, out of the front window, a Man, Woman, and little Girl stood there just staring... With evil eyes.

Unseen Danger?,"Kentucky, United States",Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: Unseen Danger?

Y ou might have read my other story about using a ouija board and nothing really big happened except my basketball goal disappearing. Well ever since I've stopped using the ouija board, every time I get out of the shower I feel dizzy like my eyes black out and I see darkness for a couple of seconds, the other day I tripped and fell because I couldn't see until I got out of the bathroom. And no I'm not drunk/on drugs or anything like that and my vision is well, I don't need glasses/contacts.

Other times in my house especially in my room it is FREEZING. I have to use four blankets on me to fall asleep. Also this happened a couple of nights ago, I was hanging out with my friend Sam, and we were watching tv and sometimes I get a cold chill then all of a sudden my arm starts to hurt really bad like it feels like someone is forcing their finger in my bone. And yes I've gone to the doctors and they said it's probably me being stressed, but what would I be stressed about? I never have anything I worry about even though I'm a teenager, I do worry about a couple of things, but nothing big.

Last night really creeped me out though, I just painted my room so I had to sleep in my living room, and I woke up around 3:30 a.m. It was pretty dark in my living room, yes I'm afraid of the dark, so I pulled the covers over my head and closed my eyes. Suddenly something whispered my name, it was a raspy voice and it said ""Tanya!"" Like it whispered to me, but it kind of screamed at me if you know what I mean. I was so afraid to move, I started to sweat because I was frightened and this is the first time I've heard something whispering my name. I have two older brothers, but one of them has moved out and the other one was at his friends house for the night.

My parents of course were in bed so it couldn't have been them. Also I have one of those water dispensers in my living room, its across from the couch I'm sleeping on. So after hearing that whisper, I froze and then heard, what I thought someone was using the knob to get water from the dispenser. I uncovered my head from the blanket and looked over thinking it was one of my parents, nothing was by the water dispenser, but the water kept bubbling, and no that's not normal, it only is suppose to bubble when someone is getting water. So yeah that freaked me out and I ran upstairs to my parents bedroom and slept on the floor.

So am I being haunted by something? Is it just my imagination because I have been reading a lot of these ghost/demon stories on this site, but I'm POSITIVE all of what I said has happened. Thanks for reading.

My Neighbours Haunted House,Canada,Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: My Neighbours Haunted House

T o start off I'd like to thank everyone who has been responding to my experiences! I really appreciate it. Lately not too too much has happened in this house of mine, I've been hearing a women speaking, and also her speaking with another presence (I don't know if its a man or women but I know she is talking with someone). Who she is, I have no clue. But I've heard her.

Also, 2 days ago, I was putting my shoes on getting ready to go out, I looked down to the kitchen and saw this yellow looking light (the size of a head) just flow threw my kitchen area. It looked a bit blurry or foggy but it didn't scare me, I didn't get any bad vibe off it... But other than that, no major update that I can recall.

I have received questions about my neighbour-hood and if there was any hauntings that occurred here, and there has actually been a severe one next door.

I live in Montreal, Quebec. In the West island. In 2000, I had once again a new neighbour (it was the like 6th person who has lived there since I have been living next-door, which is odd). So the neighbours had a girl named Camille, and her and I were the same age and became best friends. We were always together and still are. She had started to tell me that she was very scared to be home alone (she lived with her single mother which was very irresponsible and neglected her, she often left her home alone). Therefore I would always go to her place and stay with her, we would hear cupboards slamming and opening, the dogs barking hysterically, footsteps, voices... I then knew she wasn't crazy, and over the years I kept on hearing stories from her about that.

Camille and I were young at the time, late teenagers, and we one day decided to skip school and hangout at her place all day, although my mom had decided to stay home from work that exact day so I went to school, Camille stayed home alone all day. She fell asleep at around 11am on her couch watching TV, she lived in a fairly big house and was alone.

Camille got woken up by a phone call, she then answered the phone and it was the police. The cop or operator on the phone said that someone had called them from inside the house asking for help and that someone was here. Camille hung up the phone, started crying, and ran to my house which was right next door. My mom opened the door and saw her crying her eyes out, terrified.

The cops showed up to check the house, they had to come because they had received a phone call. Camille doesn't understand how that happened and still to this very day has no idea. My mom still remembers how much she was freaking out, I found out when I got back to school because she was at my house and didn't want to go back home until her mom was there.

Camille moved away a year later, we still talk all the time but she now lives 1-2 hours away... Since she left we have had another 3 people moving from that house.

Dark Shadows and Light Shadows,"Texas, United States",Misc,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Misc :: Dark Shadows and Light Shadows

F or the past couple of weeks, I've noticed an increase of shadows around me. I've been seeing those fleeting black shadows out of the corner of my eye, and on occasion, the ones that linger to let you get a better grasp on their shape. These have been ranging from tall, human shapes to small cat-size, elongated shapes, to even smaller, like a bird. Fast moving and annoying!

I'm not the only one who has seen them. I was picking up my boyfriend at his mother's house one night, and he was waiting for me outside on the driveway. When he got into the car, he asked if I'd seen the tall black shadow duck down behind the car when I turned onto the street. I hadn't. That freaked him out, he hadn't noticed it until it moved against the headlights.

Within a couple days of the dark shadows, I noticed tall, human sized white hazy shadows mixed among them. If I saw any black shadow, it was followed by a white one. Regardless of the size of the black shadow, the white shadow always seemed the same tall human one, no size change. This is not the first time I've seen the ""mingling"" of the light and dark shadows. Always the dark running from the light ones.

I've thought about it, and I seem to see these dark shadows when there is about to be a emotional upset coming in my life. Almost like harbingers of unrest. A few days before whatever news is coming arrives, I start seeing the black shadows. I just don't know WHAT is changing, just that it will be.

I've also noticed when the light ones are near, things may be upsetting, but the situation is for a good reason and usually some sort of spiritual growth or life change that benefits me, even though the time is a trying time. Almost a clearing of the air, getting things that bother me out on the table, dealing with things and getting back to my life. It can be anything, relationships, loss of friends or family, major changes at work. Anything, but not minor upsets, larger ones that require solitude and introspection, life-altering changes in course.

I sort of feel the black ones feed on the negative emotions that are running high, and the white ones are there to temper and protect, to influence at the least, or at MOST, let the natural course of emotion take place, without the interference of the negativity.

I do admit to find it highly amusing when I am upset and the black shadows are crisscrossing the hallway, and the white shadows are right behind them, and the dark ones scurry away. It seems to make me smile, as if somewhere in my subconscious I must know the black ones are there for absolutely NO good except to make things darker, and the white ones are light and protection, and apparently fairly fierce, since the dark ones flee IMMEDIATELY!

I like knowing that the black shadows are afraid. Oddly enough, it's comforting to watch.

Does this sound like a reasonable assumption? That the dark shadows are feeding off sadness, fear and unknown change, and the white shadows are there to protect and buffer? Or do they bring the emotional upheaval and the white ones come to offset it?

Since so many of us have these shadows around, I was wondering if anyone else has noticed them at specific emotional times more than at other times. Also, as soon as my emotional ""crisis"" is over, no more shadows of any kind.

My Dad Appeared to my Friends,South Africa,Family / Friends Visits,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Family / Friends Visits :: My Dad Appeared to my Friends

M y dad passed away in 1993 in a helicopter accident in Malelane, South Africa. We were very close and I still miss him dearly. In the year 2000, me and a few friends went away for a week to a secluded place on a game farm.

It was raining outside on the 3rd evening, so we all decided to stay indoors and do the marshmallow thing over a candle light. We made jokes and shared stories about our lives. I was sitting with my back to the corner, with my friends sitting around me in a circle. Later on I got tired and lied down on my friends lap.

It was getting late so I started falling asleep. The next moment it went all quiet and I opened my eyes. I looked straight into my friends eyes, but she was looking at something else behind me and the friend whose lap I was lying on. The look on her face gave me such a fright that I didn't want to turn around. I remember praying that it wasn't people breaking in and wanting to hurt us.

Eventually, after what felt like hours, I looked up and saw that it was all misty behind us, and then it was normal again.

The 2 friends that saw what was behind us, didn't want to speak about it and we left it. It bothered me the whole time and I kept on nagging them to tell me.

Eventually they told me that they saw a man behind us. Just sitting there and smiling. When I got up, he disappeared.

These 2 friends of mine are very trustworthy and I would never think that they would lie to me. This whole thing puzzled me because nothing like this has ever happened.

A few weeks passed when the 2 friends came to visit me at my mom's house, we walked passed some old photo's of my dad and that's when the girls freaked out. Apparently my dad is the man they saw sitting behind me... Smiling!

To this day I still can't figure out why my dad would appear to my friends and not to me. Why he was smiling and why he disappeared. when I got up.  They say he looked content and happy.

Why not appear to me if I'm the one that was missing him so much ? I just think it's so unfair...

Lady in Blue at the Train Station,"New York, United States",Apparitions / Voices / Touches,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Apparitions / Voices / Touches :: Lady in Blue at the Train Station

T he photos were taken close to the time of the incident but not by me. It's weird but TRUE! Here is the story of The Lady in Blue. I was born and raised in Pleasant Plains on Staten Island, NYC. In the mid 1960's when I was around 15, I like all the other kids in NY neighborhood, hung out downtown in front of the corner Drug Store.

One afternoon one of the girls who lived a few towns away needed to leave for home so I offered to walk her to the train station.

Both sides of the train station in our town were elevated. About 20 feet above street level. Both only had one way up and down and no way to get from one side to the other without going down to the street and crossing under the trestle and back up the other side. Otherwise it was a long drop if you tried to jump. The south bound side had 3 or 4 flights of stairs leading to the platform with only a small overhang for shelter. The north bound side (first photo is looking north on northbound side) had about the same number of stairs but went straight up to the platform (to where the lady is standing in the photo). On the northbound side was also a building (see photo) that had the old ticket counter and waiting area. You could still get inside for shelter but it wasn't used for much else at the time.

As we walked down the sidewalk toward the station we had to pass the south bound stairs go under the trestle and up the north bound stairs to get to the north bound train. As we approached the south bound side, sitting on the bottom step was a very old woman wearing a nice blue dress with big wide brimmed blue hat. As we got closer we could see that she was not pale completed but white with bright red lips. As kids we laughed to ourselves and commented on how bad this old woman looked with all that white make up. It would be the last time we would laugh that day.

We passed by within a few feet of her and she looked as real as anyone, just a bit stranger looking. She seemed pleasant however and smiled a big smile at us as we passed. We then walked the next 100 or so feet, went under the trestle and turned to walk up the stairs to the North bound side. We took the first step, then looked up to the top and there was the old lady looking down at us smiling (she was standing about where the lady in the photo is). We quickly looked at each other in amazement and then back, but she wasn't there anymore.

We continued climbing to the top of the stairs which were at the northern most end of the platform. When we reached the top the lady was not on the station platform. We walked half way down the platform (where the man in this second photo is) and into the waiting area but she wasn't there either. So we came back out.

Sort of half laughing about the whole thing when we noticed the lady was standing at the top of the stairs where we just walked up and where we first saw her. But we didn't pass her? We stepped back inside for a brief moment to get hold of ourselves and when we came out again she was at the far opposite end of the platform with her back to us looking in the direction of where the train would come from (we were standing about where the man is. Looking toward the far end in the photo).

We went to the right and to the opposite side of the platform (where the woman in the photo is) from her to wait for the train as the girl wanted to get on the first car. We stopped and turned around and the lady was no longer there. Now we were concerned that maybe she had fallen off the platform or that we were totally crazy. Maybe we just missed seeing her all those times. But, we hadn't turned our backs on her long enough for her to get to the waiting room and now the train was in view coming into the station. We could see the whole platform and it was empty except for us.

I told the girl I would go check to see where the old lady went after she got on the train. We stood looking in the direction of the incoming train with the full station in view. The train pulled in and stopped. The girl got on the first car (I was standing about where the woman in the photo is standing) and I went up to her window and knocked on it to say goodbye. I waved goodbye as the train pulled out of the station only to have my blood run cold when I noticed the lady in Blue sitting behind the girl smiling at me as the train pulled away.

I ran home and kept calling the girl until she got home and answered the phone. I told her what I saw and she said that when she paid the conductor she changed her seat and there was no one else there in the car.

Now not many people believe this story but we both experienced it. I never saw the girl again and never told the story until I was in my thirties. Since then I have heard of a few other people having a sighting there of the lady in blue.

The Cross and the Car,"New York, United States",Misc,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Misc :: The Cross and the Car

D uring my younger days in NY during the 60's. My friends and I used to take turns borrowing our fathers cars on a rotating basis (without their knowledge) but, not unlike many other guys. We would all get together and one guy would sneak his dads keys. Then the guys would push it out of the driveway very quietly then down the street where it was, anything goes from there on. As long as the car was home before dad woke up. After a night of driving around the island we would go home and coast the car into the driveway and no one was the wiser. We always had a good time until one night we decided to visit a cemetery at the end of a dead end road.

There were four of us this night. Nothing out of the ordinary. It was my turn to take my dads station wagon. It was a fairly new Oldsmobile vista cruiser. It had no roof rack. (this is relevant to the story)

We pushed it out of the driveway and down the street. Little did we know that this night wasn't going to be just another ordinary joy riding experience.

It began just like any other night. Nothing special and it was even getting boring just driving around. One of my friends suggested that we go to a graveyard. He just said a lot of cool things could happen in a cemetery. We figured it had to be better than what was going on so we headed toward the river. On the way one of the guys said he knew of this cemetery at the end of this old road. He gave the directions as we went. Sure enough all by itself at the end of this lonely old road was a very old cemetery.

I remember there was just one street light at the entrance but the cemetery was dark. I drove up into the cemetery until the road ended. I am not sure why now but, everyone got out of the car except me. Maybe I was nervous, or maybe concerned for my Dads car. They were all acting goofy. You know how young guys act. A couple of the guys started acting like the Night Of The Living Dead. Climbing on my car etc, until one of them broke my dads rear view mirror off the car. That took the fun out of it for me so I yelled for everyone to come back so we could leave and go to Wetson's for a burger at the other end of the island.

The guys came back to the car and one was carrying a wooden cross. It was one of those temporary markers used for graves before the headstone is put on the grave. It was faded, dirty and some of the paint was missing. The guy wanted to bring it with us but everyone objected saying it was bad luck. He held it by the end of the longest part below the cross and tossed it with a full swing into the darkness. Then he jumped in and I backed the car out of the cemetery onto the road.

Now under the street light the guys told me to burn rubber. (something we said in the 60's meaning to spin the tires) I tried and tried but could not break the tires loose from the pavement. So everyone but me got out to lighten the load. I tried and tried but still couldn't. (It was a family station wagon!) I then drove up the street and backed up as fast as I could and threw it into drive but the car would just come to an abrupt stop and stall. (Now here is a very significant part) One of the guys saw an old tire and tried to put it on the roof to see if the car even had enough power to knock it off. I told him no, it would scratch the paint and he dropped it. Well, the guys all got a big laugh about that. They all got back into the car and we drove down by the river road. It was a windy road that went up sort of the west side of the Island. As we drove along one of the guys suggested we stop by this closed bar he knew of. He said they threw away their empty kegs behind the bar and we could get a few.

So we went and I backed in and two guys go out and started loading the kegs. I should have known that they were lying and the bar was open and a few kegs they took were full. Well, the bartender had seen or heard us. We took off and now we had the bartender after us in his van. Racing down that winding road. Me screaming at them for lying to me and taking the kegs. Them rolling the kegs out of the back of the station wagon in front of the guys van until the guy broke off the chase.

By now we are all excited and I am very nervous and agitated. Just then someone yells, ""Take a right""! So I slammed on the brakes and made a right up a road with no houses. My friend said that he had been down the road a few days earlier and they had put down fresh tar to make repairs. (they did that back then)

He suggested that I make one last try to spin the tires in the new tar. I drove for a little bit and he yelled there is the tar, STOP! I did. Being in the excited state that I was, I slammed on the brakes and the car came to a full stop. Then, (after the car came to a full stop) we all heard a scraping noise on the roof of the car and a bang on the hood.

There on the hood of my fathers car was the wooden cross that everyone saw my friend throw away more than an hour before. We had driven miles, made sharp turns, sudden stops and drove quite erratically to evade the angry bartender. Yet the cross held on? OR DID IT? I don't see how with a smooth roof and no roof rack. (remember I said that in the beginning) Also, the one kid had tried to put the tire on the roof and no one saw it. Did it just get there somehow? One of my friends was beside himself, very upset and yelling at us to get rid of it. The friend who originally found it swore he threw it away. (we did all see him do it) He said it was an omen and we should keep it. I got out of the car, took it off my hood and gave it to him. We took it and talked about it the rest of the night. My one friend never was comfortable with keeping it.

We finally drove to the other side of the Island that night to Wetson's. On our way back home we got stuck driving behind another car. All of a sudden, in what seemed like slow motion, the entire area lit up as bright as day but with a strange orange glow. Then there was an explosion louder than anything I have heard to this day. The car in front of us and mine were pushed into the oncoming lane by the shock and we both screeched to a halt. By now my one friend was really upset, saying that we should have never taken the cross.

Well, it wasn't the cross' fault. I don't think. It was a huge oil tank from a refinery in New Jersey that exploded. Talk about scary. Well, we all went and watched the fire from across the river before going home. That ended our night of adventure. Our parents never knew.

I got hold of and talked to the friend who took the cross just before I originally wrote this the first time. I asked him one last time if he had put the cross on the car somehow? Nearly 40 years later he swears he did not, even explaining that if he did, how would it have stayed on the car so long and no one saw it when they were out of the car a couple times. I had to agree that I had no explanation either.

Oh and one last thing. Remember my friend that was so upset about the cross. It turned out that when the cross was cleaned and examined, the name on the cross was his Grandmothers name... We talked about this for many years...

An Old Lady's Voice,"Arkansas, United States",Apparitions / Voices / Touches,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Apparitions / Voices / Touches :: An Old Lady's Voice

I live in a nice sized town that is very historic, but not very often do you hear of a place being haunted. I never thought my new house was haunted, maybe the one we used to live in because it was old but the current house we live in is only about 20 years old. Not old at all! I think we're only the 3rd family to live here and I'm not saying my house is haunted but I did have a very odd experience.

One day my mom was at work and I was home alone. I love to stay home alone because I don't have to listen to anyone. So it was just me and my cat home. Well for a while I couldn't find my cat so I started calling her name and I heard an old ladies voice say ""Yes?"" I kind of freaked out but I told myself I was hearing things. I continued to call for my cat, I couldn't find her in my house.

Finally I heard the same voice say ""WHAT!?"" then I heard a meow... Ok so I was very confused. I finally found my cat under a table in my mom's bedroom, she was looking up at me all innocent and everything. I am basically refusing to think that my house is haunted because that's never happened before so is it that I can communicate with animals? I'm starting to think so.

I Broke the First Rule of Ouija Boards,"Missouri, United States",Ouija Board / Seances,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Ouija Board / Seances :: I Broke the First Rule of Ouija Boards

I 'm beginning to believe that my house has a demon. I was stupid, and broke the first rule of ouija boards, and played alone. Nothing responded, but something was there. The air thickened, and my room became colder. Later on that night, my dad asked if I had heard something, and I had, but I wasn't sure what. I thought that maybe, I had heard my cat, on the roof.

Then there were footsteps, heavy ones, like an angered man, stomping across the roof. I was freaked out, and ran downstairs. I told my mom someone was on the roof. My dad grabbed his shotgun, went out onto the roof, and said,""Whoever it was, they got away...""

I was officially freaked. My dad, he's blind, but he said he saw a shadow jump down, and go into the woods. I went upstairs, locked all my doors and windows, and took the ouija board (mine was homemade and secrete since my mom doesn't allow them ever since she played with one as a child) folded it in half, put the planchette with it, and placed a paper clip on the side to keep it from coming open.

Later on that night, I waited for a while before trying to go to bed, and when I closed my eyes, I heard something growl, like a cat. I thought maybe Tootsie (my cat) had snuck into the house or something, but when I looked around, I couldn't find her. I closed my eyes again, and there was the growl. I was freaked out, and kept quiet about this with my parents, because if they ever found out, I'd be dead.

Beam of Light,Canada,Orbs / Lights / Mists,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Orbs / Lights / Mists :: Beam of Light

I go to a boarding school, and apparently it's haunted, by many things. I have yet to encounter anything, but my friends have. Even though I have maybe seen things out of the corner of my eye, I'm not quite sure I believe it yet, but one thing that really weirded me out was this: My friend and I were walking on a hill, that is behind our school at night, just looking at the stars and talking.

Now, behind our school is a big forest, that is very spooky at night, and we were in front of it. I saw a beam of light move very quickly across the trees but of course I thought it was just my eyes playing tricks on me so I didn't really think much of it. My friend right after I saw it, then said ""Oh!"" I turned to her, and asked what? She said she forgot something (I can't remember what she said exactly) and I got alittle disappointed because I thought she had seen the same thing, I looked down and then she asked me what was wrong? I told her I thought she saw something, and then she looked at me, and asked me if it was the beam of light. I was scared but yet excited, she saw it too, but she had also just thought it was her eyes playing tricks on her.

I don't know what it could be, just a orb? Please, say your thoughts!

We Saw our Friend as a Spirit,"Arkansas, United States",Apparitions / Voices / Touches,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Apparitions / Voices / Touches :: We Saw our Friend as a Spirit

A t the time I was about 9 years old and my best friend Celia had just had her birthday the day before and turned 9. Me and my other friend Greta stayed the night at her house. We had a normal fun night like any kid that would stay at their friends house.

The next morning we got up and we played our favorite game to play at that age, hide and go seek. But we decided to mix it up. Celia would go hide and me and Greta would both seek because you see, celia was a VERY good hider. Me and Greta were in celia's moms bedroom counting and by the rushing footsteps we could tell she was having trouble trying to find a place to hide.

Finally we finished counting and stood up. We yelled ""Celia you better find a place fast! Were coming!"" and we stepped out of the bedroom to see ""Celia"" rushing into her bedroom (which was directly across the hall.) Me and Greta thought Ha! We've got you now! But this ""Celia"" was kind of foggy looking and didn't exactly have anything from the hips down and she floated through her bedroom door. For some reason me and Greta paid no attention to this and barged into Celia's bedroom. We looked all over that bedroom and Celia was no where to be found. She couldn't have possibly gotten out without us seeing for her bedroom wasn't exactly big.

So me and Greta, still in celia's room, shouted ""Celia just come out we can't find you!"" and the next thing we know Celia came from the living room. Me and Greta exchanged a glance as to say ""I thought I saw her go in there?"" at that moment I said ""Greta was it just me or didn't I see her do into her room?"" Greta was like... ""no... I saw it too..."" celia stood there wondering what the heck we were talking about. I then asked celia how she had slipped out of her room without us seeing her. She said ""I was never in my room I was behind the couch the whole time"" Then me and Greta started to think about how we had seen her. She was transparent, glowing, kind of foggyish, had no legs, and walked through the door. But it looked EXACTLY like her! We told celia what we had saw and we just though about it for a while.

The first thought that came to mind was GHOST! And we did what any smart little kid would do, we ran into the dining room to her mom to tell her what had happened. Her mom told us we were imagining it but I know we weren't. We spent the whole day trying to figure out what had happened and I thought maybe Celia's life was slipping away and her spirit had gotten out of her but she was technically still alive. You get what I'm saying? But celia said she felt just fine and never felt as if her life was slipping away.

Does anyone know what this could have been? Celia said she didn't even feel like she was out of her body or anything. I am now 13 and we still have not figured this out. It puzzles our mind even today!

The Haunted Catfish Plantation,"Texas, United States",Ghost Tours & Haunted Hotels,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Ghost Tours & Haunted Hotels :: The Haunted Catfish Plantation

L ast year, during the summer in July to be exact, I visited the Catfish Plantation restaurant in Waxahatchie. It was known for notable hauntings, and paranormal phenomenon. Basically, its an old haunted house turned into a theme restaurant. Me, being very interesting in paranormal incidents, I had to visit this restaurant. It was me and three of my girl friends, sitting at a small table enjoying the spooky environment, hearing tales and legends of the place from our waitress.

Sarah, one of my friends looked at the waiter and said, ""I don't believe this, ghosts aren't real..."" Our waitress stared at her in utter confusion, ""Well if you don't believe in ghosts then go around the property and take some pictures and look around, I'll be damned if you don't find something that will make you believe this place is haunted..."" Well, that's exactly what all of us did, we took out our cameras and searched the place.

One of the strange things we came across was a white smokey figure that was found in one of my other friends, Carly's, camera. It was a picture of a glass case that contained T-shirts. We all figured it had to be a smudge on the glass that showed up on film that way. Well carly walked over and took at picture of the same glass, and to our surprise, the smokey figure was gone.

But this is where the story gets strange. Before leaving the restaurant we took a picture at the front, of all four of us. In the background was a window, and it is said that you can normally see a ghost of an old woman. When we got in the car we zoomed in the window to see exactly that. A blurry figure of a woman. We were all shocked and couldn't wait to show everyone.

We arrived at my house and I ran inside with the camera to show my dad (who is very superstitious and loves the supernatural.) I showed him the picture and he said to me, ""You know, whatever is on that film may not like for you to bring it home, I would delete it..."" At that moment we heard a loud crash came from the closet. Four shelves in the closet had fallen. These shelved were glued to the walls, let alone nailed to them. ""Delete the pictures, now..."" Said my dad. ""I told you, whatever was in that picture followed you home and didn't like you having that picture...""

As for my friends who still have the pictures, they have told me the same things have happened, stuff falling unexplainably, and things being thrown down an broken.

White Lady and Fire Swirling at 2am,Philippines,Apparitions / Voices / Touches,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Apparitions / Voices / Touches :: White Lady and Fire Swirling at 2am

T his story actually happened to my cousin. One night, he and his friends decided to have a sleep over. My cousin's room has a double-decked bed. There were actually 4 of them. Two of his friends were sleeping on the floor, he was sleeping on the top bunk, and his best friend was sleeping at the lower bunk.

At around 2am in the morning, weird things started to happen. His best friend was awaken because my cousin was shaking at the top bunk. As if somebody was strangling him or as if he was having a bad dream. He was about to get up and check on my cousin but was terrified, as he saw a lady in white staring at him at the foot of the bed! The apparition lasted for about less than a minute, then the lady in white disappeared. He immediately jumped out of his bed and awaken my cousin. Two of their friends were awakened as well, so they then discussed what happened.

The next morning, we received a phone call from one of our neighbors. They just witnessed a weird incident at around 2am. The same time that the lady showed up. Our neighbors said that around 2am, there was like a fire swirling at the roof of our house and it lasted for about a minute.

They were about to call the fire station as they thought that our house was burning. Was there a connection between the things that happened? It is a mystery up to now.

Weird Voice,"California, United States",Misc,"I was a senior in high school when I experienced something I can't explain and have only told one person (my mom) about.

I was getting ready for my prom and I had a great time doing so, I had an even greater time once I was there. After the prom, me and my friends went to a party. There wasn't anyone there and everyone decided to go somewhere else, I told my date I just wanted to go home because I was tired.

He took me home and as soon as I got there I changed into my pajamas and made some food. My mom was out at a marketing dinner and because she would be home soon, I decided to wait up for her. I was in her room eating and watching T.V. when all of a sudden I felt as if I were half asleep and as if I were somewhere else. I don't know where. The next thing that happened was that I heard a man calling me. His voice was deep, but not creepy or evil sounding. He wasn't mean or pushy about it either. When he called me I told him that I wasn't ready. I wasn't speaking out loud, it was more like I was ""thinking to him...""

He said it was time to go and I again told him that I didn't want to and that I wasn't ready. And that was it, I snapped out of whatever it was I was in and I started crying because I was so scared. I then had the urge to write my mom a letter to tell her what happened and to tell her how much I loved her because I felt as if something were going to happen to me. For whatever reason, I didn't just fell asleep somehow.

I woke up the next day and I told my mom what happened and she said it was probably just a dream. I told her it wasn't and she could tell by my face I wasn't lying. Also, my eyes were swollen, so I knew for sure I had been crying. She then asked if I had been drinking, I hadn't. She also asked me why I didn't call her. I didn't know. This is what keeps tearing me back and forth. I know it happened because I experienced it, yet I am not 100 percent sure because I WOULD have called her. I call her for everything big or small, she is my best friend. It was just something so different that I can't make sense of.

I am open to ALL thoughts and ideas, please feel free to ask any questions.

Making His Presence Known,"Virginia, United States",Family / Friends Visits,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Family / Friends Visits :: Making His Presence Known

T his ""haunting"" took place in an apartment that my Mom and Dad were sharing in Hampton, VA. My dad had died back in October 1994 after developing complications after heart bypass surgery. I arrived from Colorado the next day to attend his upcoming funeral. That night, I stayed in a small bedroom in the apartment, which may have been occupied by my dad when he was alive.

That night I was able to go directly to sleep. At some point during the night, I was awakened by what sounded like someone violently rustling a plastic bag at the foot of the bed. I didn't dare look in that direction for fear of who (or what) I might see. Gradually, as I listened, the sound of the rustling died down until I couldn't hear it anymore.

At that point, I decided to look toward the foot of the bed. There was nothing there. I assumed it was my dad, who was just letting me know that he is still around. It really scared me and I had a fitful sleep that night. My dad's funeral was still another couple of days away, so I knew that I'd be spending another few nights in that room.

The following night, before going to bed, I spoke to my dad as if he was there in the room with me and said to him that I would prefer if he didn't disturb my sleep while I was there and that I was really frightened. I never experienced that noise again and was able to sleep peacefully in the room until I left.

However, my mom has said that she has heard him call her name and has seen his shadow going up and down the stairs in the apartment. This occurred for several weeks after his funeral until one night she saw his shadow go down the stairs toward the front door. He was never seen again after that.

I Asked Him What Heaven Was Like,"North Dakota, United States",Family / Friends Visits,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Family / Friends Visits :: I Asked Him What Heaven Was Like

I was in the USAF stationed at Grand Forks N.D. in the early 80's. I had a friend who worked with my husband. His name was Scott, but we called him ""Lurch"". He worked on the airplanes. That morning, him and four others were working on a plane that had just come back in. It was business as usual. The plane blew up, and all five of the airman were killed. It was caused by human error.

I was at home (base housing) at the time of the explosion, it shook the whole house. A couple of nights later I came home from work (swing shift) and the house was like an icebox. I checked the heat and it said 75. I just could not get warm. I went to bed, and I was in a half asleep, and half awake state. I rolled over and Lurch was sitting in a chair next to my bed. I looked at his eyes, they were such a beautiful blue, just like in life. I said ""Lurch what are you doing here""? ""Your suppose to be dead..."" I asked him what heaven is like, have you seen GOD""? He said ""I don't know, I don't want to be dead"". He said that ""I've got a new baby, and a wife"". ""I want to be with them..."" I told him that he could watch over the baby, and his wife from heaven. But that he had to go to the light. He said okay and then he disappeared.

The next day I went over to his house to pay my respects to his wife, and family. I so wanted to tell her what I had experienced, but I was afraid that I would upset her. So I never told her about it. I assured her though that Lurch was with GOD, and that he would watch over them.

A Sudden Appearance in the Road,"South Carolina, United States",Orbs / Lights / Mists,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Orbs / Lights / Mists :: A Sudden Appearance in the Road

T his episode occurred in South Carolina in a very rural (wooded) area called Poston, which is where I grew up. There are a lot of dirt roads in this area and a few sets of railroad tracks running through it, and we would get the occasional freight train rolling by.

One evening when I was about 11 years old, I was riding my bicycle to my Great-Grandmother's house. It was just getting dark outside, which is a bad time to be out near those woods alone, especially with the stories that were told about the weird things that people encounter in the night.

As I approached a small, fensed-in corn field on the left side of the dirt road, I suddenly noticed that a sort of mist started to form in the middle of the road near the corn field (my eyes are getting a little misty just thinking about that night). I continued to ride my bike and the closer I got to this mist in the road, the more it started to shape itself into a human form. I started thinking about all the stories I've heard about ghosts of folks long gone roaming these dirt roads at night.

I kept riding toward it with my mouth open, ready to let out a scream. And just as I was about to yell out, it vanished. By that time, I was almost close enough to touch whatever it was. But, it was gone. While I was at my great-grandmother's, I dreaded having to take that ride back home because by then it was really dark outside. But, I had to get back home so I plucked up some courage and rode my bike back down that road.

Luckily, I never saw the figure again. That was a very scary moment for me that I shall never forget.

Ghost of Eastern State Penitentary,"Pennsylvania, United States",Ghost Tours & Haunted Hotels,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Ghost Tours & Haunted Hotels :: Ghost of Eastern State Penitentary

H i, my name is Ana and I went on March 21 to philly with my fiance and his aunt, I had seen the penitentiary first mentioned on America's Creepiest destinations, so I thought ""oh cool my fiance is into mobsters and all and I like a good scare"". We took the 12:00 pm day tour and proceeded to see all the exciting rooms in the jail and it was awesome hearing all the stories and history.

I was snapping away at all the rooms I could and looked in every nook and cranny, I was curious about this place so I wanted to capture all the good stuff. Well we went to death row cellblock, I kind of wandered off away from the tour, I stayed like 15 ft behind looking at the greenhouse and saying ""cool I like this tour"".

Behind me was 2 young girls and their dad, when I was looking around I heard something say ""hey"" or ""hello"" I wasn't paying mind because I thought it was the dad talking to the girls, but the second time I was peeking into the greenhouse, I heard it again this time in my ear, I was like ok and I looked around, the girls looked around and I was like ok I am not crazy, so I asked the girls and their dad ""did you hear that?"" They said I heard that too.

We Feel a Presence in our Apartment,"California, United States",Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: We Feel a Presence in our Apartment

I have always loved anything that involves the paranormal. I always thought it was cool to have a haunted house, until now that I actually live in one. I moved to Redlands, CA to be closer to work. Many people know that the city itself is very old and spooky. Lots of ghost activity and many cults.

My fiance and I moved to an apartment thinking nothing of the paranormal. Never really thought about apartments being haunted, until things started happening. Lights would turn on and off, soap being thrown at my fiances back, door knobs turning back and forth. One night a candle was actually lit by someone or something. It was even a Jesus candle. Water focets would turn on, a lot of little things that we just blew off as nothing.

But as time passed, we could feel a presence in our master bedroom, I get a heavy male presence, and it really scares me. When we are laying in bed, I feel like something is hovering over us, not wanting us to sleep. My fiance Ralph always feels like someone's face is right next to his.

Ralph also told me he felt like something was hoping on our bed as he was laying in bed. What really confirmed things was when my 3 year old step daughter said ""Look,they are dancing in my room!"" When I looked in her room, it was empty. I looked at Ralph and decided to ask Lauren some questions. I asked if it was a boy or girl, she said it was a girl with ""vicki's hair"" (MY NAME) I'm guessing she had black hair. I also asked if she is good or bad, Lauren said ""oh she's really nice"". I am beginning to think that there is more than one ghost. Lauren seems to think this one is really nice, when me and Ralph feel the male in our room is not.

If someone can please help me out, Its just beginning to get really stressful. Its a bit embarrassing being a 23 year old woman still sleeping with the light on. What can we do to get rid of all the ghosts in our home? I've tried telling them to go to the light but that doesn't seem to work.

Also one night me and Ralph were just laying in bed talking about pretty much everything when the subject of the devil came up. He told me he once read on the internet that there was a web site of demon names... He said he logged off because he got scared. During our conversation he had mentioned a few of the demon names, could that have brought other ""things"" in to our home just because he said their names? It scares me to think about it.

I'm a person with very big faith so I try and pray a lot in our home but nothing seems to stop. If anyone could spit some advice to me, it would be very much appreciated.

Ghost Copying People and Other Things,Iceland,A Haunted Life,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: A Haunted Life :: Ghost Copying People and Other Things

I haven't been around as of much lately, mainly because I've been busy with school and work and I've been lurking on paranormal forums around the web. I've decided to come here again because I like the general atmosphere and how people here can actually have a serious discussion about the paranormal.

In my last story I wrote about an experience I had at my boyfriends parents house , since then we have moved twice, we rented an apartment for about 2-3 months and now we've bought a home. I've had experiences in both places that I'm going to write here because of the stuff that happened in the apartment are too short to put in a different story.

We moved there in October last year. We were living on the top floor in the middle, the smaller apartment. With the apartment you get a decent sized storage place in the basement, which just looks normal, nothing creepy, painted white, the floors were carpets, but I couldn't go down there. The reason for this is because I'm rather sensitive about spirits and I've always felt a dark angry spirit there. I just hated going down there I'm not sure what it was, so I just let my boyfriend go down there.

The ghost in our apartment seemed to be rather friendly, he didn't do much except move the toilet paper and hide things, he never really scared me. He copied things we said, which only happened on two occasions that I remember.

First incident was when me and my boyfriend were going to go to bed, and all over a sudden the porch door bursts open, now this is in winter in Iceland so it was windy and rainy, so my boyfriend runs and closes the door (Nothing paranormal with the door, the handle was broken, we had to tie the unbroken part to the oven so it would stay closed, we forgot to do tie it that night) Now he's struggling the door and I'm laying in bed when I hear something standing in the doorway talking exactly like my boyfriend and saying ""omg"" over and over, my boyfriend has a habit of doing that so I just thought it was him, the figure walks over and sits on the bed, I just thought it was my boyfriend until not 2 minutes later my boyfriend comes in and goes to bed.

During Christmas break we had our friends over every night until the wee-hours, we'd play guitar-hero, board games, Dungeons and Dragons and did whatever we felt like.

On one night we were all playing D and D, our friend who was the dungeon master (He plays all the characters we encountered) would change his voice for each character he was acting, one in particular was a character named Kurt. We played all night and when they left me and my boyfriend just went to bed, not feeling very tired.

After a while I hear ""Kurt"" talking, it startled me but it was over quick, I remembered then reading about ghosts that sometimes copy what you do and shrugged it off as just that.

In January we moved into the house we are in now. It sends a welcoming vibe, it's old compared to other houses here and I feel in love with it as soon as I saw it.

Before we moved in we wanted to do some painting, my boyfriend works as a fisherman so he wasn't there at the time, I was painting and listening to music when I heard little kids running on the stairs. I knew for a fact that there weren't any kids in the house. I just smiled and kept painting.

A few nights after that I invited some friends over to help me paint the living room. I had to go pick one of them up, when we were driving back I saw this eagle fly past my windscreen, probably bigger than me, nonetheless I slammed the brakes, then realized that they aren't any eagles here. I'm not sure whether this is related but it scared me.

We arrived the house and start painting, we were getting into it and I felt something touch my hair. I looked around that there was nothing that I could've caught my hair like that, I accused everyone for touching my hair, and they just thought I was crazy.

So after we moved in and have been living happily, everyone says that this house has a good vibe. But there is some strange activity going on.

Firstly when we are upstairs in bed we keep hearing a clicking sound coming from downstairs, like someone is turning the light switches on and off. Each time we go to investigate it stops. My boyfriend has twice heard a strange sound that he can not describe and friends tell me they sometimes hear strange voices (other than my own) when they're talking to me on the phone and I'm alone.

I had an experience a few nights ago actually, I was sitting here in the computer room, now we have an airmatress here so whoever is using the lappy can sit comfortably while the other is on the PC, I saw a little grey spotted kitten walk over the mattress. We do have a cat, but she's completely black. Sunday morning our little ghost kitten came up and laid on my bed, our living cat was outside, and when I turned to look at the kitten she was gone. I named her Julia after that.

And last night we saw her again, walk from underneath the closet. There was also strange music coming from downstairs, that stopped as soon as my boyfriend went to check on it.

I work in the evenings in the Icelandic equivalent of UPS, I drive out packages and stuff like that, so I'm usually alone in the post-house at nights. There's a guy there that walks past the beeper that beeps when people are coming in.

My friend (Who is very sensitive to ghosts) was helping me work one night as soon as she went into the building she had this horrible feeling of dread and hate. She just wanted to lie down and die.

Another work related incident... I was going to someone's house with a package, when I saw a little boy standing behind me, I jumped and thought maybe he lived there. When I blinked he was gone.

I found it strange that within the last few months I've seem to been experiencing more than I do usually, I'm wondering whether this is a warning

But alas, I have written enough for one night, I'll keep you updated if you're interested.

Just to add one thing; I saw fire in my window yesterday, I poured the nearest liquid over it, but there were no burn marks (Window is made out of wood) Could this be related?

The Eye and Other Unwordly Beings,"Maryland, United States",Non Human Entities,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Non Human Entities :: The Eye and Other Unwordly Beings

M y first demonic experience happened when I was only five-years-old. The year was 1995 in Sykesville, Md. I was sleeping in our guest room because my little bed had broken recently. Because I was little, I think the demonic beings I saw were presented to me in a way I could understand. Still, at the time, and even now it's very chilling to think about.

For instance, I did not see anything particularly ""scary"" at first. I remember that night I was sleeping on a couch when it happened. I was fully awake and I started to see things. At first, I stared out the window and then I saw a small ""cartoonish"" broom appear on the end of the bed that was a couple feet away from the couch. It moved back and forth in a sweeping motion. However, I found it more interesting than scary.

I continued to watch that little broom until out of the corner of my eye I was something flying around. I looked over to my right and saw a equally small, equally cartoonish flying carpet. It seriously resembled that magic flying carpet in the Aladdin story. It hovered for awhile, but then started flying around the bed. At this point, I looked back to the broom to see if it was still there. It was still ""sweeping..."" I finally concluded that this was funny, but tried to shut my eyes to go to sleep.

I turned on my right side for awhile, and this is when I saw the third thing. Something black was crawling on the floor beside the couch. I guess you really couldn't call it crawling, it was more like loping. All I saw was its back. Then I saw another one. Then I saw another one. One-by-one, these small hunched figures passed by the couch. I don't know how many there were, but I'd say I saw about thirty pass by.

The room was mostly dark except for the moonlight shining in through the window, but I could still see those things. Their darkness was way blacker than the darkness in the room. After watching these things pass by the couch, I didn't know what to make of it. I was frozen with fear and began to break out in a cold sweat. I turned back on my back so I wouldn't see them anymore, but was still too scared to call my mom.

Finally, I mustered up enough courage to look to my right again. The figures were still passing by. I looked at the place where the broom had been sweeping. It had disappeared. The ""magic carpet"" had also disappeared.

That's when the fourth and final thing appeared. While those hunched figures were passing by the couch, out of the darkness an eye stated to appear. It was huge, it was menacing, it was ugly. It just stared at me while I stared back, terrified but too scared to call out to my parents. I stared back at it for a long time.

Then, it stated slowly growing bigger. I felt like it was going to kill me. I suddenly realized it wasn't getting bigger, it was just coming closer. At that moment, I shut my eyes only to open them a few seconds later to see if it was still there. It was. Finally, I kept my eyes closed for a long time. When I opened them, it was gone. The hunched figures had also vanished. Everything was back to normal except me. I was sweaty, scared, and about to cry.

Finally I called my mom. I called her numerous times, but she never heard me so I stopped calling. I couldn't move because I was still so scared. Finally I was able to go to sleep.

To this day, I don't know why it happened while I was so young. However, I did learn that my Dad's mother had a demonic experience in the same room one night when she was still alive. My mom heard her screaming and went in there to find her wide eyed and afraid of something that was in the room. So my mom prayed and she calmed down. I don't think my experience had anything to do with demons being in that room though. This is because I don't think demons are in that room. I think my experience happened as a test - a test that I failed. Because I was so young, I didn't know about praying to God. In fact, it never occurred to me that these strange things were in anyway related to satan. They were just scary.

However, I have since then come to realize just how scary satan is. I have also come to realize that my God is 100 times more powerful. Since then, there have been more experiences involving demons that have been usually as frightening. However, with God's help, I have been able to overcome these situations.

This eye has appeared to me one more time since that night. The second time it appeared to me, I was 13 years after the first appearance. I was taking a nap when all of the sudden I woke up. I looked out my window and saw that it was getting dark out. After this, I glanced up at the ceiling and that's when I saw it. A black form was hovering above me. It was like a blob. It had a form, but it didn't. It was all very strange. Because I have had similar experiences with demons, I immediately started to talk to God in my head.

Pretty soon, the oh so familiar paralysis set in and I felt like something was suffocating me. I didn't try to move because I knew it was hopeless. I kept my eyes open, and soon, the black form started to take the shape of an eye. This eye was the exact same eye mentioned above. It stared at me, and I got really scared then because I have never had the same thing appear twice to me. I immediately shut my eyes and started praying faster. I suddenly felt like I was being shocked. It hurt so much, but I couldn't fight it so I didn't try.

After awhile, it stopped. I didn't open my eyes however, and I'm glad I didn't. I began to feel something on my forehead. Someone was tapping their fingernail on my head. It was insistent and wouldn't stop. It hurt. I think the demon was trying to get me to open my eyes. I prayed and prayed for God to save me from this attack.

Finally, I tried saying the name of Jesus. However, I could hardly move my mouth. So I tried saying ""Lord"". Finally, I was able to get ""lod"" out and kept on saying it over and over out loud until my tongue could move more freely. Finally, everything stopped and I opened my eyes. Everything was back to normal.

The last time I had an experience, there was no eye. I was in my bed but couldn't sleep when suddenly I felt like I had been given a sleeping pill. I couldn't keep my eyes open and fell into a deep sleep. But before I fell asleep, I felt a shock run through my body.

A little while later, I woke up to the sound of growling beside my bed. It was a horrible sound and I was too scared to look over the side of the bed. Immediately I started praying. But as I started praying, I felt that shock and then felt like I was being made to fall asleep again. As soon as I started sleeping, I ""woke up"" in my mind. Maybe I was dreaming, but it felt like I was in my head. I was in a toy store and there was a baby doll and it was crying.

Suddenly, someone behind me told me to touch its finger. I didn't. They told me again to hold the doll's finger. I wouldn't. Finally I did and felt a shock like I have never experienced before. Then, everything changed. I was in the middle of a circle of... things. They were all around me telling me their names. Their names I cannot remember now, but then they said they were going to shock me again. So they did. I felt like I was going to die.

Suddenly, I remembered to cry out to God. I started saying ""LORD"" over and over again. I really meant to say, ""Lord, please stop satan from trying to hurt and scare me"" but all I could get out was ""LORD"". So over and over I repeated that name and gradually I woke up. I woke up saying, ""Lord""

Now, when I think back to that time, I realize that it was a test. I had not been waking with the lord during that time. But still this experience reminds me that The Great Rescuer will always come to your aid. You have only to call his name.

Angry Grandmother?,"North Carolina, United States",Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: Angry Grandmother?

H i. This is my first story and I'm going to try and be as detailed as possible so forgive me if I go overboard. My family is from a small mill town just outside Charlotte NC. Both my parents were born and raised there, but when I was five my dad got transferred and we moved to SC. The house that this took place in is my dads parents house that he grew up in. My grandmother (his mom) passed away about 10 years ago and my grandfather lived in the house until 3 years ago when my dad had to put in a nursing home because of his dementia. My dad was transferred back to NC so he and my mom moved into the house and began remodeling.

Now, and this is important, my grandmother and my mom did not get along. My grandmother, god rest her soul, was a very unpleasant women. She was manipulative and hateful. She wasn't a good mom to my dad. He is an only child. They had many, many issues that, unfortunately, were never resolved before she died. She never thought my mom was good enough for my dad. I remember lots of tension as a kid. She even went as far as to storm out of our house on Christmas day because she didn't like the present my mom got for her. So needless to say I'm sure my mother living in her house and remodeling her things is making her roll over in her grave.

Now, this all happened Thanksgiving of this past year. My husband, our two kids and I, all live in SC so we spend the night at my mom and dads whenever we come visit. The day was like any other Thanksgiving, food, drinks and all my family together. Strange things had been happening since they moved in. Things out of place, doors closing on there own, the doorbell ringing at random, all things that my are easily explained away.

This particular evening was not out of the ordinary. Nothing strange happened. We had a lovely dinner. After all my family said goodbye we got the babies ready for bed. They both sleep in my moms room. The house is fairly small. Two bedrooms one bath, living room and kitchen. The bedrooms are side by side. Me and my husband sleep in my dads old room.

So it gets late and we all go to bed. Now, my husband does not believe in ghosts. He is quite the skeptic. So when we get up the next morning and he tells me that he thinks the house is haunted I'm shocked to say the least. He tells me that about 2 or 3am he woke up because he thought he heard our son crying. He laid there for a few minutes because he knew both kids were in my moms room and she would take care of it.

As he laid there listening he realized that what he heard was not our son at all. It was a women's voice. He thought that my mom had gotten up and possibly was talking to my dad. He said he was rolling over to go back to sleep when the voice got louder. He described it as a women calling out, but he couldn't understand what she was saying. He says this went on for about half and hour. He just laid there trying to rationalize in his head all the things that it could be. My parents have 3 cats so maybe it was them playing. Or maybe it was something outside. But he said the longer he listed the more he realized it wasn't any of those things. It was definitely coming from inside the house. He finally fell back asleep.

The next morning he tells me and my mom this story and we both just laughed it off. Ha ha it must be Jane (my grandmother) harassing you. So we all just let it go.

That day things in the house were weird again. The doorbell rang 3 different times when no one was at the door. My dad finally got enough and disconnected it. Stuff in the kitchen was out of place. My coffee somehow managed to make its way from the counter where I sat it down to the top of the bookshelf while I was in the bathroom. My kids were fussy all day which may not have had anything to do with a ghost. My daughter who is usually very independent clung to me all day long. The cats were very spastic. Running about and being weird. They usually just lay around. The bathroom door refused to stay open all day. It kept slamming shut. Again all things that are explained away.

So that night we all went to bed. In the middle of the night my husband starts shaking me to wake me up. I roll over about to ask him what the hell he's thinking, I'm very unpleasant when woken up, when he covers my mouth with his hand and says ""listen"". So I lay there listening intently when I hear it. A women's voice. It sounded like it was in the hallway. I wasn't able to make out what it was saying, but it did indeed sound like it was calling for something. So we're both laying there listening and giggling like two school girls at how ridiculous this situation is. I begin whispering that I'm sure its the cats or something.

After a few minutes I get up the nerve to go investigate. I open the bedroom door and see what looks like a cloud of mist in the hallway. It immediately vanishes when I step out of the bedroom. So I'm standing there certain that I'm seeing things when the DISCONNECTED doorbell starts ringing. DING DONG DING DONG DING DONG. Over and over. Wakes everyone in the whole house up. My dad goes and checks the wires and they're all just as he left them. Disconnected. This goes on for a good 2 minutes then just stops. My kids are hysterical and my poor non believing husband is convinced satan himself is coming to kill us all.

We finally got the babies back to sleep and all went back to bed. The rest of the night was calm. We went home the next day. Since then my dad has gotten rid of the doorbell all together. Things still come up missing or out of place, but my mom says she hasn't heard anything at night.

Now maybe this is a ghost maybe not. My question is if it is indeed my grandmother and she's pissed off that my mom is living in her house and remodeling why isn't she calling out to her? Why bother my husband, who never even met her? I'm open to all suggestions.

A Whisper in my Ear,Ireland,Apparitions / Voices / Touches,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Apparitions / Voices / Touches :: A Whisper in my Ear

I have to begin by saying that I am, I guess, confused, on the whole issue of the existence of ghosts or spirits. I am not necessarily a ""believer"" but I also am not narrow-minded, and who understands everything about life, while we are living or dead? It seems possible if not probable that when we die some of our energy lives on, either with those we knew in life or at a place of significance to us. We are all energy.

A few months ago I was fast asleep on a regular weekday night and woke up in the middle of the night. I couldn't really say what time it was, at a guess around 3 or 4 maybe. It was unusual for me to wake up in the middle of the night, I'm usually out cold until morning! As I turned on my side in bed facing the wall I heard as clear as anything a female voice whisper the word ""WOW""! In my right ear. It was so unbelievably clear that I turned around quickly but my room was still. Of all words I don't understand why it was ""WOW""! As I have said before I do not know what to make of this, but I do know that it was real for sure. I didn't sleep for the rest of the night!

If I hear someone say ""WOW"" now I kind of am reminded and wonder if it has any significance and if I should pay extra attention to them or what they are saying!

I Think a Ghost Was in my Room,"Oregon, United States",Apparitions / Voices / Touches,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Apparitions / Voices / Touches :: I Think a Ghost Was in my Room

I was asleep in my room at about 2:00 AM. I had my T.V. on so that it would shine brightly on my wall, because sometimes I can get scared when I have just watched ghost mysteries or Horror Movies. I opened my eyes to the wall that the T.V. was shining on, and I saw a figure go across the wall, as if someone had walked behind me from my door to the other side of the room. It was like a light black type person. So I looked back, and nothing was there.

I was so scared I thought my chest and heart were going to exploded! I prayed to god that whatever it was for god to protect me from it. And this happened on Thursday. Since that night, it hasn't happened again. I don't think my house is haunted. But I do think it was a visiting spirit. So if somebody can tell me what I saw, please tell me.

And I swear to god this happened. So please believe me. I'm am not sure what it was, but it DID NOT hurt me or harm me. And I am telling the truth. But I have a tip for you guys. If you see something you're not sure what it is, just pray to god to protect you and he will protect you. So don't be scared if you see a ghost or a spirit, just do what I told you, just pray to god. God loves you, and doesn't want you to be afraid.

Ghostly Bedroom in Mayfair,"Pennsylvania, United States",Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: Ghostly Bedroom in Mayfair

T his one happened while we were living in Philadelphia. At that point, I was about 2 and my parents and I were living in a townhouse on Bleigh St. In the Mayfair section of Philadelphia. Although I was too young to remember living there, my mom swears that the house was haunted and she is a pretty level-headed woman.

There were several strange occurrences that happened that really have no logical explanation. One time, my mom realized that she was missing $100. Thinking that my dad had taken it, she asked him about it and he denied it. A few days later, someone punched her jewelry box, leaving the imprint of a fist in it. Once again, she just figured that it was my dad that had done it and thought nothing more of it.

A few weeks later while my aunt was at the house, my mom suddenly got the urge to pull up a corner of the carpet in the living room. When she did, she found five $20 bills arranged in a perfect fan under the carpet. Knowing that there is no way that the money could have been arranged there and stayed in a perfect fan after the carpet was put down and pulled back up, she figured that some other presence in the house was paying her back for the money that had disappeared.

Aside from those few events, most of the paranormal activity was centered around my bedroom. I don't know if these memories of mine are real or not, but I seem to remember laying in my crib and seeing flying balls of red and green lights swirling above me crib. I must have seen something, because I would cry and scream ""Out, out!"" not stopping until my mom had taken me outside onto the sidewalk in front of the house.

Several of my aunts and uncles had also stayed in that bedroom at times, getting equally freaked out. When my uncle stayed there, he slept with a shotgun on his chest, because he said that it felt like someone was coming to kill him the entire time he was asleep in there.

We've long since moved out of that house, but I would love to know the history of it and try to talk to the person living there now and see if they have experienced anything. Does anyone know any way that I could find out the history of the house? My mom should remember the exact house number and I would love to know what exactly I experienced.

Just Passing Through,"Arizona, United States",Apparitions / Voices / Touches,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Apparitions / Voices / Touches :: Just Passing Through

P rior to moving into my home in 2003, I had lived in an apartment in the Phoenix neighborhood of Ahwatukee. I lived there alone with my three ferrets. There was no other strange activity that had happened before or after the incident I am about to relay, but I will say that the area had been inhabited by Native Americans years and years ago. The apartment building was within walking distance to a state park where petroglyphs are still visible on the rocks. For those that don't know, petroglyphs are designs and patterns that the Native Americans carved into the rocks many years ago. They are quite amazing.

One evening I woke in the middle of the night and heard paper rustling near my computer desk. Having ferrets and all I just assumed it was one of them getting into things. Ferrets, like cats, love the sound of rustling paper and plastic bags. Sometimes I would let my ferret CJ, sleep on the bed. I called out, ""CJ,"" expecting him to come to the bed when he heard my voice. Then I remembered that I had made sure all three were in their cage before turning in for the night. For some reason I did not feel completely scared out of my mind. It's amazing how brave you become when you live on your own with the nearest relative being 3,000 miles away. I listened some more to the rustling wondering what the heck it could be. There was no breeze. The ceiling fan was not on -- Nor was the air conditioning. Knowing I had to be up early for work the next day I decided to ignore it. It seem to stop.

Right when I was just about to fall asleep, I started to hear what sounded like someone plucking the mattress springs like a guitar. I could feel the vibration of it through the bed. Instead of getting scared, I actually felt annoyed. I wanted whatever it was to just go away so I could sleep. I felt like it just wanted my attention. When I refused to give in, it went away. I never experienced anything like that again in the apartment but I wondered if it was just a wandering soul that was trying to get a rise out of me.

Once it realized it wasn't going to have the desired affect on me, it left. It was a very strange occurrence which luckily did not repeat itself throughout the duration of my lease. Still, I found it odd. Thanks for reading.

"Hands, Voices and Haunted Objects","Louisiana, United States",Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: Hands, Voices and Haunted Objects

I don't know where to begin. My mother and I both had similar encounters when I was about seven, but I only learned about hers last year. Now that I've put the pieces together, its even stranger than I thought. I always figured that my seven-year-old brain was just showing me what I wanted to see, you know? I always thought the house was haunted when I was little; I still do. But looking back, I know I was only partially awake, and I wasn't just seeing things.

I was asleep one night, when something strange woke me up. Afterward, I couldn't remember my first few moments awake until about a year ago. I must've accidentally blocked it out somehow. Something, many things, were whispering, and I'm guessing that was what woke me up. At first, I didn't pay very much attention to it; I wanted to go back to sleep. But after a few minutes of awareness, what the voices were saying was clear.

""Erin Go to your parents room Erin Its not safe here please leave your parents can protect you Erin..."" each voice and statement melting into the others. This whispering repeated for a few minutes, slowly becoming louder and louder until I was almost halfway convinced that I should do what the voices said. Then one of the voices did it. It sounded like it was about an inch away from my face, and it said ""Erin, please. Go to your parents' room..."" I was up, alright, but I wasn't as nearly as functional as I would've hoped.

So I hopped out of bed and left my room, but halfway down the hall near my parents room, I realized that I needed to go to the bathroom, and the bathroom was behind me.

My hallway is a weird one. There's a corner you need to turn if you want to see my bedroom door or the bathroom, but I already past that point by a foot or so when I wanted to go. There weren't any lights on in the house that I can remember, but I could see clearly enough. I turned halfway around so I could go back to use the bathroom, but I stopped in my tracks before I could completely turn to face it.

There was a hand (maybe it was two, I can't remember) about two feet away from my head on the other side of the turn. Of course, I was fully awake then. The thing looked like it was made of - don't laugh at me - cool whip, and it was pure white with a sort of bluish tint where the shadow would be. It felt like I stood there for a hour or two to stare at it, but I know that it wasn't even a full second before I started running. I didn't scream, I just ran. To this day I think that was the fastest I have ever run. Impossibly fast.

When I ran into my parents' room, they were still asleep. I quickly slammed the door behind me and let out a breath that I must've been holding when I saw the hand(s). My parents woke up when the door slammed and turned on the light. I crawled into bed with them, crying my eyes out and muttering about hands and cool whip. I think they thought I had a bad dream or something, but now I know that it wasn't just me that was seeing ghosts.

Last year, I told my mom I remembered the first part of my experience, and she decided to tell me one of her own. At around the same time - when I was seven or so - my mother heard someone walking in a circle in our attic. My dad was in his office, and I was in my room, so it couldn't have been us. Eventually, the walking stopped. She told my father about it, but to this day he thinks me and my mother are both nuts. Lucky him.

That year we got my dog. She's a Doberman, and she's absolutely horrible as a guard dog. She never barks or howls or anything; she just groans and sits around all day doing nothing.

Well anyway, my father's friend came over for a visit, and he heard the footsteps too. He told my mom that she might have some sort of object that possessed a ghost. He suggested masks, for some reason. Anyway, after he left, she went up into the attic and searched for anything that felt out of place. She found a mask that she was going to give me to color. She had found it at a garage sale, and spray painted it white before she would give it to me.

Well apparently it looked out of place, so my mom took it downstairs. When her foot hit the ground of the first story, my dog -- the lump that does nothing all day and doesn't make a sound - sat up and howled at the top of her lungs. As you can imagine, my mom freaked and burned that thing in our outdoor fireplace.

To this day, we aren't sure what happened when I was seven. It hasn't happened for a while now, but I'm starting to wonder about those voices when I woke up. Is my house some sort of battle ground for the paranormal? Good God, I hope not!

My Grandpa Knew,Canada,Family / Friends Visits,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Family / Friends Visits :: My Grandpa Knew

G randpa: ""when am I going back home?"" Mom: ""July 15"" Grandpa: ""No, find an earlier flight, that's too late"" Mom:""How do you know?"" Grandpa: ""Albert told me"". This conversation is the first time we noticed that my grandpa was able to see and communicate with his deceased brother. My grandpa was diagnosed with a serious liver disease and his life was being timed. My mom got a flight for july 15 but he said no. So my mom got an earlier flight.

My grandpa was talking to us then, telling us that Albert (his brother) would be picking him up when he got to the airport in philippines on july 13. My mom ignoring this fact she got a flight for july 11.

The day that he was leaving, they were still in my house, my grandpa started to wave at the ceiling. My grandma, dad, mom, brothers and I all looked up to see who he was waving at, he said ""Albert"". By this time we got the chills. Then he continued to say ""he's reminding me that he's going to pick me up at the airport""

My grandpa traveled from Canada all the way to Philippines in two days, he arrived noon of July 13 pronounced half dead. He had no control of his body, his eyes were closed, though he was still breathing. We realized that Albert had ""picked him up"".

Grandpa Always Has The Last Word,"Connecticut, United States",Family / Friends Visits,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Family / Friends Visits :: Grandpa Always Has The Last Word

M y paternal grandfather was as cantankerous and ornery as they come; however he was fiercely loyal to his family and friends. He built the house my Dad was born and grew up in, always had grease under his nails from his job calibrating heavy machinery, and drove a 1966 Chevelle that most of my high school friends would have given their eye-teeth for. He was still driving it up until his death in 1999.

Grandpa took guff from no one and if someone were to start an argument with him, they more than likely would not win. He was a tough nut to crack and very few crossed him. Up into my thirties he was still handing me a dollar bill and with a wink of an eye would tell me not to spend it all in one place. You were either a Dumb-Ass or a Smart-Ass in Grandpa's book. Both words were interchangeably and were a regular part of Grandpa's vocabulary.

Grandpa came for a visit one year in the 1980s. I was about 16 or 17. Being the 80s and all, I had just spent a half hour in the bathroom with a can of Aqua Net hair spray to perfect that defied gravity look that most teenage girls my age were doing at the time. Grandpa took one look at me and exclaimed, ""Jennifer, what the hell did you do to your hair?! Did you comb it with a pitchfork?"" I, being ever so smug, responded,""Sorry Grandpa, I'm just a product of the music I listen to..."" He shook his head, walked away and under his breath I heard him say, ""Smart-Ass...""

On another occasion my family went up to Burlington, VT for a getaway weekend. We were out with Grandpa driving 30 mph in his old Chevelle down a 55 mph road when we stopped at a general store to pick a few things up. Apparently I was taking too long. Grandpa was leaning on the horn and shouting for me to come out. After turning about six shades of red, and paying for my Coke, I quickly got to the car. Grandpa beeped the horn one last time for good measure as I placed my hand on the door handle. ""Get in the car, Dumb-Ass,"" he shouted. I wanted to hide under a rock, I was so humiliated.

Right before the turn of the new millennium, my sister called me to let me know that Grandpa had passed. I was sad but in all honesty he and I were not that close (as if you couldn't tell already). On the following afternoon before we ventured to Connecticut for the funeral, I was walking through my apartment when I could literally smell my grandfather. I could smell the grease that always coated his hands and also the smells of his home that consisted of cooking smells and cleaning products. If I had shut my eyes I could have sworn he was right there. I started to cry and I said out loud, ""I'm sorry Grandpa that I didn't visit you more. I'm so sorry..."" The smell faded after awhile.

The night before the funeral I learned that as rough as my Grandfather was, he had been supplying an underprivileged family with money for years anonymously. He helped many people when they were down on their luck and never brought it up or bragged about it. He was tough on his kids and grand kids as his own parents were to him. It was an extreme form of tough love.

On the morning of the funeral while waiting my turn for the shower, I decided to go down to the basement and poke around Grandpa's old workbench. He had quotes he had gathered over the years written in his own handwriting with a lead pencil all over the workbench. I started reading them and suddenly felt nostalgic. There was even a message from my Aunt, his youngest child, and it was dated 1960. As I continued to read and reflect on the hidden parts of his life that I had just found out about, a block of wood dislodged itself from the workbench and landed on my foot. Man, did that hurt. I reached down to rub my foot when I happened to notice the following quote that had been obscured by said block of wood: ""Your looks may be fading but you will always be a Dumb-Ass. Nobody likes a Dumb-Ass...""

I didn't know whether to laugh or cry. Even in death Grandpa indeed had gotten in the last word.

Trailer Spirit,"Texas, United States",Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: Trailer Spirit

I lived in a trailer with my dad after my parents divorced. One night, as I was making dinner, I heard a knock at the door and when I looked out, there was no one was there, it kept happening all night long. I just ignored it, I thought that maybe it was some sort of echoing since the trailers were so close together.

The next following months were ok, nothing really happened. After I graduated high school things started getting strange. While taking a shower, I could hear what sounded like stomping, and my dad was rarely there (always working, I guess). In the 2nd bathroom, there would always be a sulfurous smell, like rotten eggs or something, the back room (where I slept) would always have a chill. It was even cold in the summertime, I started sleeping in the living room and night after night a pair of headlights would always illuminate the room, there was never any headlights because as soon as it would happen, I always peeked out the window and it was always pitch dark.

Things never seemed to work right, the television would turn on and off, the heater would turn on in the summer, the shower would always turn on and off. Everything would end up in the weirdest places, the salt shaker would end up in the bathroom, can food would be on top of the fridge, there was always flies in the house, I mean just everything was always missing.

I reconciled with my mom and ended up going back to live with her. About a month later, my older brother separated from his wife (like father, like son), so he stayed with my dad and it was easy for them because they both worked together. I visited my dad and brother quite often and my brother started telling me things that were happening, of course I related and told him that even though it was spooky, nothing bad ever really happened.

Exactly 1 week later my brother moved out and didn't give any real explanation to my dad, he ended up telling me that he was there one night alone and his wife was going to come over and talk about the marriage. He said that someone kept calling on the home phone but nothing showed on the caller ID, there was whispering and static noises, he said that he could kind of hear a man and woman arguing, and that each time he could hear the woman say, ""you don't even love me"", he said that's what she would say over and over again, barely above a whisper.

As soon as his wife got there it stopped, he said that when she came in the trailer she felt like she couldn't breathe and that she felt this sense of sadness. He just ended up leaving because he said that it scared him. I think the phone ringing was what made him really leave.

My dad ended up moving in with his new girlfriend and one night we were all out. Myself, my brother, his wife, my dad's girlfriend. Well we started talking about the trailer and how creepy it was (mind you, we never told my dad about what we heard or saw) he told us that one night after we were all gone, he was asleep on his bed (which was directly on the floor) and he felt like someone was choking him, he woke up and just thought that maybe he was dreaming. He went back to sleep and he said that something was pulling at his arms and legs, pulling him into two different directions, he turned on a small lamp and said that he could see someone's reflection in the window, that it was a man with a baseball hat on, when he tried to get up it vanished. He said that maybe it was a dream but it didn't explain why his arms and legs were hurting.

My dad called me before he finalized the move out and had me come get some figurines that I had left in the back bathroom. I didn't know what he was talking about so I went over there and went to the back bathroom and before I could really make it there, I heard glass smashing, it was the figurines. They all were thrown to the ground, but the weird thing is those were not there when I packed up and no one knew where they came from. We also found a shoe box full of old pictures, and inside we found a few pictures of the man that my dad saw.

To this day we still have those pictures, it's like we can't seem to throw them out, the landlord said he didn't know who the previous owners were to that trailer, he bought it at an auction. I have some more incidents to share, so if you'd like to hear more than you can let me know, and I will email them to you.

The Occult Adventurer: Why I Do What I Do,"California, United States",Ghost Hunting,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Ghost Hunting :: The Occult Adventurer: Why I Do What I Do

T he home at Brougham Way is a strange home. When HPI (Haunted and Paranormal Investigations International) got wind of it, Shannon sent out two teams of seasoned investigators that retrieved 8 EVPs from this home. Shannon also sent me to do a second preliminary with two other seasoned investigators. The second investigation resulted with no EVPs and no photographic evidence. The occupant asked if I could have a Scouting Mission at her home, with ghosthunters-in-training. I ran it by Shannon and she said ""why not?"" I told Shan, since the place is not haunted, it will be fun for the newbies to experiment in scouting a private residence. Shan told me, that the place is haunted, because the first preliminary investigation resulted with 8 EVPs captured at the residence. I didn't know about the first preliminary investigation, nor did I know about the 8 EVPs. I was surprised.

When I did have a Scouting Mission at this residence, we conducted a seance that produced amazing results. Results that stunned 15 newbies with the sounds of a little girl giggling and saying ""hi"", something that we could all hear with our own ears. The sounds of the wall echoing with a ripping effect, and later a series of knocks on the wall. Something that we could all hear and we all witnessed. A seance that was so frightening to the newbies, that many broke the circle, some were crying and many who did not want to continue with the seance.

On March 29, 2008, Saturday. 2100 hours. Seasoned paranormal investigators arrived to the Brougham Residence. They were: Shannon McCabe, Paul Dale Roberts, Chris Grissom, Jennifer Baca, Tim Hawkins, John Wachter, Michele Paykel, Angela Kesti, Donna Reynolds, Kristen Sheley, Michelle Stump. We were equipped with all kinds of ghost hunting equipment, such as temperature gauges, EVP Readers, numerous video cameras, digital cameras, dowsing rods, digital audio recorders, Listen Up Sound Enhancers. We were prepared to document the events of the second seance.

After I briefed all of the investigators on what occurred during the first seance, we prepared to conduct three seance sessions in 2 rooms that seem to have the most activity. I was completely jazzed after the briefing thinking that what occurred at the first seance, will happen again and this time we will have video evidence of what transpires. One of the reasons why I do what I do, is because it's my 'high'. I get an adrenaline rush when I witness true paranormal activity. It doesn't happen very often, but when it does and I can witness the events with my own senses and not just with machines, is the ultimate 'high'.

On this night the three sessions of the seance were conducted. It is said that the former owner, a man named Harold, haunts this home, also a little girl (name unknown). During the seance session, we talked with the little girl first and at some point the walkie talkie turned on and we could hear a little girl saying ""la, la, la, la"" during the first transmission. Then the second transmission, she repeats herself. There were 6 walkie talkies in the bedroom, all placed on the same channel according to Chris Grissom, and only one walkie talkie had the voice of a little girl. During the time the walkie talkie turned on by itself, John Wachter was feeling something near him or on him. The temperature gauges that were pointed towards John indicated a cold spot. Jennifer saw what appeared to be a small shadow move along the wall. Michelle Stump felt a cold spot in the hallway. Shannon watched the TV monitors and discovered some unusual orb activity.

With three sessions of seances that began at 2100 hours and ended at 0100 hours, it was time to call it a night. I decided to stay the night in the most haunted room. With the video camera running and recording my sleep session, I later learned nothing of significance happened during the whole night I stayed in that room. I was disappointed that more didn't happen. My adrenaline had run down to an all time low.

What keeps me going with these investigations is that I know the afterlife exists, I experienced the paranormal with my own senses, I have no doubt that the paranormal is all around us. If I hadn't experienced the paranormal, I would have quit the ghost writing business a long time ago and moved on or reinvent myself to some other persona. What keeps me going is the adventure.

I have always been an adventurer. It's probably because I am the direct descendent of Captain Bartholomew 'Black Bart' Roberts, a Welch pirate. Adventure runs in my DNA. That is probably why I worked with US Army's C.I.D. (Criminal Investigation Division) in Germany and became so prolific with my busts, the lead special agent would tell me ""Porkchops (my code name), you are a legend"". With trench coat, sunglasses, long hair, beard and a packed .45, I went throughout Germany busting the bad guys. Working undercover, pretending I was a former soldier that was now a major drug dealer and sometimes a pimp.

I joined the Army twice, once in 1973 and the next time around in 1979, in which I joined Military Intelligence, with another code name 'Hollywood'. During my break in between Army tours, I was a professional dancer, that once danced 205 hours, with 5 minute breaks on every hour for the Guinness Book of World Records. I also was a firefighter for a while. Yes, I sought out adventure and I had the energy for it. To be a good ghost hunter and ghostwriter, you must have four ingredients, they are: energy, being fearless, being adventurous and being prolific. Most writers will spend a couple of weeks on one article. I whip out articles in perhaps 2 or 3 hours, being prolific with my writings and getting out the information as quickly as possible.

Since I have experienced the paranormal, I keep seeking it out for that adrenaline rush. I head out to every location, with fast music resonating throughout my car the 'Ghost Tracker'. I never listen to slow, dull music, it must always be upbeat and fast. It gets me pumped for the night!

I left the Brougham residence in Citrus Heights and headed to Stockton, CA. I had Rick James' Gold Album blasting fast tunes to keep me pumped up as I headed to a location in Stockton to interview a lady that witnessed a doppelganger. To be a successful ghostwriter, you can't be shy, you have to confront people in the street, you must engage them to get the story. At times, I am somewhat of a maverick, but Shannon keeps me on the straight and narrow.

When I first met Shan, I learned she had a very diverse background also, she was a woman that sought out adventure and her life story compares close to my life story. We were two peas in a pod and now we pump out the investigations and we pump out the stories!

Shan has touched the edge-of-fame and so have I. Shan with her singing career and I, with my former dancing career. Shannon and I are currently working on a T.V. Show called ""Ghost Girls"" with Nancy Bradley, the Celebrities Psychic, and Shan has appeared on Nash Bridges, and Tylenol commercial. All the while, I was participating in dancing movies like Rollerboogie and Skatetown USA. Shan has reinvented herself and so have I many times over. I have reinvented myself from military undercover cop to firefighter to professional dancer to military intelligence to OPFOR Army instructor to Governor's Office of Emergency Services to comic book critic to freelance journalist to Ghost hunter/Ghostwriter.

The natural adrenaline rush of any adventure is experiencing life to the maximum, that is why I probably parachuted from a plane once, took flying lessons for a Cessna airplane and later a helicopter, para-sailed in Thailand or rappelled down the Moaning Caverns. I seek out the thrill of the rush. I never thought ghost hunting would pump me up, but like I said when you experience the paranormal firsthand, the excitement is hard to contain.

The disappointment is also hard for me to contain and when this second seance didn't produce the results I wanted, I felt let down by the ghosts of this house. Perhaps Michelle Stump's theory is correct, she believes that since the newbies did the first seance, their fear was an exhilarating energy for the entities to feed on. When the seasoned investigators participated in the second seance, there was no more fear to feed on and nothing resulted because of that. Who knows why ghosts do what they do?

Most seasoned investigators are fearless when it comes to the unknown and everyone in this HPI group is fearless. There are so many possibilities to dwell on, I wouldn't know what theory would be more feasible. But, I must admit I favor Michelle's theory.

Chris Grissom one of the lead investigators, during our break session from the seance, described what happened to him recently on a lone wolf scouting mission to a haunted warehouse. While in the warehouse, he saw a black dark mass by some pallets. He watched the black mass dart swiftly through the door and heard the door slam violently. The door never opened, nor did it close. This was his first time witnessing the paranormal with his own eyes. When he first told me the story, you could feel his adrenaline rush from this experience. That is exactly what I am talking about.

When I left the Brougham residence, I headed over to Stockton to meet Eissu Gown at Starbucks. My interview with Eissu was amazing, she is the first person I ever interviewed that described her encounter with a doppelganger. She was at an airport, ready to catch a plane, when she was confronted by a person that looked exactly like her. This doppelganger that caught her eye vanished into the crowd and it left her feeling odd and strange. While she was surprised to see her double, her double didn't act surprised, but merely looked at her with a glazed look. This was Eissu's only encounter with the paranormal, but it is an encounter she will never forget.

Well, now that you know why I do what I do, if I had never experienced anything paranormal, I would have left this business a long time ago, but after 80 plus investigations and experiencing something significant three times, where my own senses were involved, I keep going and going and going, like the Eveready Bunny.

Now as I close this article, let's see what Shan's findings and conclusion is on the investigation and seance session on Brougham Way. Shan take it away!

SHANNON'S FINDINGS: We got some orb activity on my video camera. My camera, Sony 30GB IR, NEVER picks up orbs. We got 1 EVP from the walkie talkie, but we need to really analyze it first.

SHANNON'S CONCLUSION: This house is haunted. We have numerous EVP's from prior investigations, and some interesting evidence on www.HPIparanormal.net. You can find the investigation under ""Home in Citrus Heights"" I just wish it would have been a little bit more exciting when we were there, I've heard so many stories! I wanted to really experience the walls ripping apart for myself!

Shaking With the Ouija Board Pointer,"Arizona, United States",Ouija Board / Seances,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Ouija Board / Seances :: Shaking With the Ouija Board Pointer

M y life is weird. I have the ability to see spirits, and communicate with them. I know how to access the spirit realm, using meditation, and I am very fond of the spirits I see regularly. Apparently, it is a gift. I have many spirit encounters that would frighten the average person quite a bit every month, but I have gotten used to them. And, for some reason, I can teach other people how to do this. I have taught three of my friends in the past. I know why I have these powers, but I will go into that in another story. This story is about one of my Ouija board experiences.

I have an Ouija board. For some reason, we can never find it when we want it, except on rare occasions like this one. A few years ago, me, my older brother and my older sister were using the ouija board, and we asked the ouija board a few questions. We found out his name was Earl, and he died in 1985. After about 15 minutes, I went and asked it a question. ""How did you live your life?"" First, The pointer started shaking, then, I started shaking with it. I wasn't breathing until my sister removed the pointer from the ouija board. I knew something like that was going to happed, since I am well known in the spirit realm. After that, I wasn't allowed to use the ouija board. But now, I want to do it more than ever. Can someone please tell me what I did to anger the spirit?

Unusual Ghost in my Sister's House,United Kingdom,Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: Unusual Ghost in my Sister's House

J ust to clarify, my sister has moved out and now lives with her boyfriend about 10 minutes drive away. She's pathetic when she's on her own at night and every time her boyfriend goes out I have to sleep over in the spare room.

At roughly midnight I was watching TV when I heard a strange noise, kind of like when you get ringing in your ears but not in your ears, then I heard footsteps in the kitchen downstairs, obviously it wasn't me or my sister, at first I thought it was the cat but then it became increasingly loud.

The footprints then seemed to proceed up the stairs, my sister kept a toolbox in the spare room because of the boiler, so thinking the footsteps were an intruders, I grabbed a hammer and a screwdriver and slowly crept towards the landing, the footsteps carried on, but there was no-one there, so I thought I was imagining it until I felt a hand grab my leg, when I looked down there was a skeletal hand with a blue aura surrounding it, not thinking I slammed the hammer at the hand which, believe it or not, did absolutely nothing.

I then saw footprints in the carpet leading to wards the bathroom so I slowly pushed open the door and I saw a young girls face in the mirror, then she smiled an evil smile the mirror smashed and that was that.

I told my sister in the morning and she told me she often heard footprints and clattering in the bathroom but never dared get out of bed.

Shadow Baby,"Texas, United States",Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: Shadow Baby

A few months ago, my wife and kids and I were staying the night at my mothers house. In a room that was added on later on after building it. My mom was renting the house from this couple. This room was always kind of freaky. On night my wife said she saw this Cylinder shaped object floating in the room towards the door. I thought that was strange. But nothing compared to what she saw next.

On the night that we last stayed there, my wife, my two little girls and I were sleeping on a king sized bed. I was asleep so was my oldest daughter. My wife was sitting up in bed rocking my other little one in her arms. She swears she was still awake but kind of dozing off. With nothing but the light of the Computer Modem (not the monitor) on only gave little light in the room. Enough to make out the shapes of the objects in the room. Also everyone else in the house was asleep. So no sound other then the buzzing.

The Bed was in the corner of the room. She was sleeping near the wall and I was on the outside of the bed. She said she looked in my area and saw something kind of moving, like the very top of someone's head. More like a child in the crawling position. She told me later that it was moving really slow down the side of the bead. She was so scared. She double checked to see if it wasn't neither of the girls that may have gotten up to play or something (they both aren't scared of the dark). They both were a sleep.

Slowly it kept ""crawling"" towards the foot of the bed until it got to the corner. When it got there she told me that it poked its head up just enough to see the black of the eyes. But without hesitating it ducked back down the turned the corner crawling a little faster towards my wife. She told me that she lied down as fast as she could thinking it saw her. But again she swears that she was awake. She shook me and whispered my name over and over until I woke up. He sat up quick and asked what was wrong. She told me and I looked for it. I didn't not see anything. And I admit I was freaked out too. All of the strange experiences that I have had all my life from a kid to a grown man sort of gotten my nerves all crazy.

That is the event that happened that night. My mom no longer lives in that house.

The bathroom in that house always scared me. When I would take showers there, my face would get numb all the way down my arms.

Haunted Squad Bay,"California, United States",Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: Haunted Squad Bay

A s everyone can tell from my user name, I am a Marine. These stories occurred while I was going through Boot Camp in sunny California. And in case your wondering, I didn't get to enjoy any of it! While in boot camp we lived in long open squad bays that had an entrance to the head and and shower rooms at the front and a single back hatch that was never opened.

Part of the training that we went through involved standing watch by the front hatch. This watch was posted starting as soon as the lights went out at 10:00 pm and went in shifts until 5:00 am when everyone had to get up. It is easy to understand that on a military base where the recruits are miserable and a very small minority just lose it and decide to end it all, that some ""interesting"" things can happen while standing post particularly late at night.

The first incident I experienced occurred around 2:30 in the morning. I was touring the squad bay as ordered to keep an eye out for any of the recruits violating the rules or any recruit that might be trying to harm himself or others for some reason. When touring the head I heard a strange noise coming from one of the back stalls in the restroom. The stalls in boot camp didn't have any doors on them so it was easy to see that there was no one back there. I turned to leave when I heard it again, it sounded like something was rubbing on that top bar that runs across the front of a line of stalls.

Of course I ran back to look again but there was nothing there! Slightly on edge because I took my duty seriously and something was giving me a strange feeling every time I went in to that room I went and woke my relief. He claimed to be ""tuned"" to the paranormal. He heard the same sounds and said he felt something was wrong about that room. Later after graduation we asked our instructors and were told that 40 odd years before a recruit had hung himself in that exact stall!

The second incident that I experienced occurred while on duty in the last couple weeks of boot camp in the newer 3rd phase squad bay. I was walking towards the front of the squad bay when a humanoid figure comes running from the entrance to the head and straight down the center of the squad bay and in to the uniforms that we had hanging in the rear of the squad bay for inspection. I, of course, thought it was one of the recruits messing around so I chased after the figure until it went into the uniforms. I got mad thinking that the ""recruit"" was going to mess up the uniforms and so I started aggressively searching for him. After 15 minutes of searching through every rack of uniforms and up every single row of bunks and not seeing anyone out of their rack and all quiet is started to think that it wasn't a living human recruit after all. I never found out what or who that might have been but it was interesting to say the least.

Both of these experiences were just the start of paranormal experiences I have had while in the military. I have and quite a few for one person and I have heard even more.

I was in my room when all of a sudden I hear this thumping noise over my head that sounded like a cane hitting the floor, but we don't have an attic so there shouldn't be a noise above my head. I called my mom to come into the hall, she was in her room, but when she did, the noise would stop (this happened about three times before it stopped). She said she didn't hear anything except the clock ticking, so when she back into her bedroom, the noise started again, it was louder than before.

That night when I told her what I heard, she said that there was an old woman who lived here before us that would walk with a cane, after hearing that I got the chills. I started to think of ways that noise could have been made, maybe it was a squirrel, but it was too late for squirrels to be out, so I thought that it might have been something else, but I just couldn't think of anything that would work ,I really didn't know what it was.

So ever since then I been thinking that it was the lady that my mom told me about just telling me that she was still there, so she probably didn't mean to scare just to let me know.

Final Goodbye from Grandpa,"Arizona, United States",Family / Friends Visits,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Family / Friends Visits :: Final Goodbye from Grandpa

I really have enjoyed this site, and has inspired me to write about my experiences. I have many stories, but this one is my favorite. It happened in Phoenix, AZ.  I'll give a bit of background first. My grandpa was an amazing man. He was born in 1912 in Grand Junction, Colorado. He met my Grandma there and they were married in 1937.

They moved to Prescott, AZ due to work, and lived there for years. In the mid 40's, then moved to Phoenix, and have remained here since. He was a good man, always followed the rules and was both hated and loved for it. Unfortunately, he was a smoker most of his life (I am too... I know, dumb).

So, as the years went on, his health began to fail. He was diagnosed with emphysema in the late '70s. I was adopted in 1984 by my parents, and was brought to my grandparents house. I was his favorite (being the youngest, and a girl!) He was on oxygen the rest of his life, and I cherish the memories I had with him. He was in and out of the hospital in the late '80s for complications due to his condition. He passed away on September 17th, 1990. Now to the story.

The last time I saw him was the previous evening. We were all visiting him in his hospital room, talking and I'm sure the adults were speaking of things that a 6 year old was unaware of. I was allowed to feed him that night, and he told me ""Slow down! You're feeding me too fast!"" We eventually went home, and I was sent to bed.

The middle of the night, I was awakened to someone sitting on my bed. I was fully awake and sat up. There, sitting on the edge of my bed was my Grandpa, I remember he looked kind of ethereal, and had a glow about him. He didn't have any oxygen on. I asked him why he was there. He just smiled and patted my head. I felt calm (usually I am terrified when these things happen). I laid back down and went back to sleep.

The next morning, my mother came into my room and told me that Grandpa had died last night at 2:30am. I told her what happened, and she started to cry. I, to this day, am blessed that he chose to say goodbye to me that night. I miss him so much and wish that I'd have known him better.

Thanks for reading my story, and trust me, I have many more to come as I have experienced the paranormal from a very young age. Hope you enjoyed.

Haunted House and Doppelgangers on Hancock Street,"North Carolina, United States",Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: Haunted House and Doppelgangers on Hancock Street

W hen I was 11 my family decided to move to move to an old house in Oxford, NC. My parents were stumped as whether to buy this house or another, so they had us kids kind of make the final decision. We loved the place. It was huge... Well, compared to other places we lived. It was constructed in the early 1900s, and had been added onto through the years. My sister Therra and I loved it. My little brother Eric was too small to care.

The strange stuff started happening almost immediately. It was to be the first night we were going to stay in the house, and we had already mostly moved in. My mom was cleaning and dusting the kitchen and unpacking, while my dad was out picking up another load from the Henderson house. I was riding my bike up and down the sidewalk.

Upon passing one time, I looked through the wispy curtains into the house, and could see my mom placing a fancy porcelain soup dish on the dining room table. My stomach rumbled.

I rode my bike down the driveway and stashed it in the garage. I ran in one of the back doors into the kitchen, grabbed a bowl and spoon from the drainer. My mom asked what I was doing. I told her getting some soup! She asked, what soup, as I pushed through the swinging door into the dining room only to find it still empty. The table wasn't even in the house yet! I told my mom what happened, and she said maybe we had a ghost welcoming us home.

After that we had a series of strange instances, what can only be described as a doppelganger. Everyone in the house would experience someone in the house calling them... Only the person who had done the calling either wasn't there, or hadn't really done the calling. My parents still experience this, even now that my sister and I no longer live there. It mainly occurs right before we show up for a visit too.

Another instance of the doppelganger, skipping ahead in time a little, was when my sister and I were waiting for one of our parents to get home for work so we could go out for the night, Friday night! Therra and her group of friends, and my whole group of friends were all hanging out in the front yard. I was in my bedroom hanging out with my boyfriend. Well suddenly we heard my dad pull in the driveway. I saw the headlights and heard the music blasting and everything. So we headed out to the front yard and waited. And we waited and waited for my dad to come out. I peeked down the driveway thinking maybe he was finishing listening to a song or something. Low and behold, there was no car in the driveway! All of us kids kind of freaked out. And just as we were all in the driveway exclaiming to one another, my dad pulled up for real.

The car pulling in the driveway happened quite a bit after that. Even when I got the Volkswagen Fox, we had seen that night, and dad got a Toyota Tacoma, and mom got a Toyota Rav4. It mainly happened with whatever vehicle dad was driving for some reason.

The first Sunday we lived there, and many there after, we all would smell bacon, eggs, and sausage cooking in the kitchen around 7 am.

Another instance happened when I was about 15. Me, my sister, my mom, and my brother were all in the living room. I was on the floor watching playing with the cat, mom was helping Eric with schoolwork, and I don't know what Therra was doing but she was on the big couch. Suddenly, our dog Abby, and Tabby cat Steve, started going haywire at the area in the dining room, where there was what the Realtor explained as a Strawberry stain, on the rug, (I always thought it looked more like a blood stain.) Abby went mad barking, and the cat fizzed up hissing like crazy!

Ever since then, me and my mother will occasionally see a shadow that roams from the dining room, to the kitchen, and sometimes from the back room (adjoining the rear of the dining room, and is next to the kitchen) and go into the hallway, which is left of the dining room.

At the age of around 16, me, my sister, and my brother all got ""new"" furniture from an auction. It was antique mahogany and mine was an antique cherry set. I got a four post bed, beautiful dresser, and matching drawers. After this, me and my sister experienced our beds shaking, lightly, like the washer was on, and off balance on spin cycle. I never thought much of it until I experienced it, and I noticed the washer wasn't even on when I had gone to the kitchen for a drink. When I got back the bed was still shaking when I lay on it. I thought maybe it was my heart beating, and it wasn't the same rhythm. I also experienced the scent of a soft perfume wandering through my room sometimes after we got the new furniture.

When hurricane Fran hit us, shadows were darting everywhere around that house, and there was a definite charge in the air other than the excitement of the storm. It really felt like there were more people in that house other than us family, worrying. My skeptic father even mentioned something of it.

One last thing I think might be attributed to the friendly ghosts in that house was the welcoming feeling everyone would say they had at that house. Family and friends alike. You would just get a good feeling like you were where you were supposed to be. A sort of home coming feeling.

In my sister's room, there was a definite uneasiness. But that is the only place I really ever felt uncomfortable. That is all I can remember about that house. If I can think of anything, or my sister or mom reminds me of anything, I will post it.

Oh I just remembered something. This was kind of scary. When we were younger, my father had built me and my sister a loft bed. It was a queen bed on top, and my sister's twin bed and her desk underneath.

I lay on top not really able to sleep. I was staring down at the floor, when I saw a flash of a red dot. I perked my head up thinking that was odd. I remember suddenly getting a really bad feeling. Then I heard this growl. Shivers went down my spine. Then I hear, ""Steph? Are you awake?"" ""Yeah,"" I say to my sister. ""Did you hear that?"" ""Yeah,"" I told her. ""Can I sleep with you?"" ""Uh huh!"" And with her bed right next to the ladder she scrambled up like a monkey with a lion on her tail.

Shortly after she moved into my brother's room, and he moved into what was the family room. I remember seeing something that looked like a giant cocoon in the corner one night. I read about someone with the same exact experience on another site. But never could get a response from him. He had the growling, then later the cocoon thingy. Strange.

That is definitely all I can remember now! Thanks for reading! I look forward to your input!

Ghost Cottages in Belfast,Ireland,Apparitions / Voices / Touches,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Apparitions / Voices / Touches :: Ghost Cottages in Belfast

M y mother experienced this event when she was 14 years of age and she wrote it in her diary the same day as it occurred so this is an accurate account. On St James' street in Belfast, N.Ireland on 14th June 1970 at approximately 2pm my mother and her sister boarded a bus which followed a route from the suburban area of Belfast in towards the centre of the city and back again.

The pair of siblings boarded the bus that morning on its return journey. They had just been on a shopping trip and each had heavy bags of items and they were in a reasonably good mood.

The bus made an uneventful return journey to the suburbs of Belfast ahead of schedule so they decided to exit the bus early and enter a shopping centre called the Park Centre and purchase ice cream.

The street leading toward the shopping centre was a busy main street with heavy traffic and large numbers of pedestrians. Half way down the road were two warehouses with peculiarly large amount of space between them but when the pair of siblings drew level with the warehouses they noticed that the space was no longer empty. There was a straight line of wooden rubble beginning at the wall of one of the warehouses and ending at the wall of the other. In the very centre stood a battered wooden cottage which was filthy and with jagged holes in the roof and dried moss coated the wooden walls which my mother touched and it came off as green powder on the palm of her hand.

They passed a small window which was set in a rotting wooden frame. An elderly woman was wiping the glass with a cloth and as they passed she opened the window and greeted them casually. They responded politely and walked on. My mother wandered if she had just imagined the space between the warehouses but her sister asked where the battered cottages had come from. She was considerably disturbed by this unexplainable event and she tried in vain to figure it out.

They continued down the road and entered the shopping centre and she pushed the thought of the cottages out of her mind.

They passed the site of the cottages on their way back from the shopping centre. The cottages were not there. The site was bare and empty as it usually was. They were confused and frightened; they hastened home to tell their parents but they did not believe them. They have not seen the cottages ever since.

My mother and I visited the site recently but over the thirty eight years which had passed since the incident, the warehouses had been demolished and houses built on the site.

Family Hauntings Around my Home,"Alabama, United States",Family / Friends Visits,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Family / Friends Visits :: Family Hauntings Around my Home

I 'm about to tell you two things that have happened in or around my home, the first one being when I was seven years old. It's about my uncle Eugene. Eugen was always my hero from when I was two, until I was seven. My mother passed away when I was two years old, so I moved in with my grandparents and uncle, and my dad moved to another town.

Now don't get me wrong, I still saw my dad every weekend, but for the majority of those 4 years, my main role model was my uncle Eugene. So you can imagine how devastated I was when I had to watch the paramedics come into my house, put my uncle on a stretcher and then into the ambulance. They took him to the hospital, but it was too late, he had passed away from an asthma attack, the same as my mother.

Well, I cried myself to sleep that night, and my grandmother decided that me and my sister should sleep in her room for a few nights because Eugene's room was right next to ours. So the night after he had died, we were sleeping in there. My grandmother turned off the lights, and her and my sister fell asleep. I've had problems getting to sleep all my life, so I laid there for about two hours trying to get to sleep. I opened my eyes for the hundredth time and realized there was a light on somewhere in the house.

I looked to my left and right, my sister and grandmother were still asleep, and my grandfather was at work. So I slowly sat up in the bed and stared through the doorway. The light was on in Eugene's room. We also had this breathing machine in our kitchen that he would use when his asthma would get to him, and as I stared in horror at his bedroom door, the machine turned on, and I heard him breathing into it. I laid back down quickly and closed my eyes as tight as I possibly could. And somehow I fell asleep.

That was the story about my uncle, here's the one about my great grandmothers house.

This one actually took place a few weeks ago. My great grandmother fell about 3 months ago and broke her hip, so she's been in and out of the hospital, when she's not at the hospital, she stays at our house, her house is right next to ours. I play bass guitar in a band, and I needed to get some practice in, so I went out there top practice, because I would be all alone out there.

I played through a few songs that we have, then I started playing this one we based off of a 50's song, and every time I would play that particular song, from the back room in the house, I would hear what sounded like the closet door open, something bump, and then footsteps pacing around the room. This would happen every time I played that song. And just recently I found out my grandfathers brother had died in that house, and also it was a house my great grandfather had built, so I don't know what's going on out there.

Mommy Ego,"Texas, United States",A Haunted Life,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: A Haunted Life :: Mommy Ego

I grew up in a town called Austin, when I was a kid my aunt used to watch me after school along with her son and my little brother. We were the typical trouble making kids who always went out on our little adventures but there was something horribly wrong with not just my aunts house, but the whole neighborhood. I remember this like it happened earlier today and I will never forget the things that happened to us back then.

The start of everything was my younger cousin mike telling me and my little brother about this woman he called ""mommy ego"" and how she would follow him wherever we went, I used to think it was all made up and that he just wanted attention. One day we were all watching TV after school, my aunt had gone out to do something, she was super proactive in the schools and all. A commercial for one of those sink attachable water filters came on and a woman asked ""would you like a refreshing glass of water?"" as soon as that question had been asked, every sink in the house turned on all the way, cupboards flung open and that was it.

Needless to say we were totally bewildered, mike just sat there like it was nothing out of the ordinary. I got up and turned the sink off in the kitchen, walked into the bathroom to turn the sink off in there too. When I looked up I noticed the small barred window, there were snakes (at least 10) winding around the bars, sliding up the glass as if they were trying to get in. I freaked out and called mikes dad. He told us to stay inside as he went to the side of the house with a garden hoe and killed the snakes. Eventually my mom came over to pick me and my brother up and that was the end of the day.

Sometime later, the 3 of us were out and about in the neighborhood, exploring the creek that was near by. One of our favorite places to go was the bridge that crossed over the creek, there were dozens of mexican free tail bats that lived under there and it was fun for us to go down there and try and look at them. The smell was horrible, as we slid down the cement drainage ramp down into the clearing the water makes when the creek floods, we saw something dart off into some of the bushes on the other side of the bridge (under where all the bats were), we were curious so we ran along the water line under the bridge, terrified that a bat would bite one of us so we were definitely in a hurry.

As we went further down the creek into a brushy area that seemed very out of sight from the road, we noticed something in the water. It was a dead lamb, well the skeleton of one anyway... Inside its ribcage there was a snake coiled up under water, it was so strange. We freaked out and ran back home.

This is where it starts to get serious. One weekend we had come over to spend the night, mikes older sisters were in charge of baby sitting us, we were in the age area of about 11-13. Everything was normal until around bedtime. Mike said something about ""mommy ego"" being mad at him. We shrugged it off as usual. At about 2am we heard a scratching noise from the other side of the bedroom door. They were very slow and deep sounding. We were all huddled up in the same room on some bunk beds, when the scratching noises started getting louder we all got up on the top bunk together. The scratching stopped and for a minute I was relieved until we heard the soft voice of a woman, it was distorted and hard to understand what she was saying, it almost sounded like she was singing a lullaby. We were dead quiet trying to listen to what was happening with the occasional whisper from one of us asking ""what did she say?"" or something like that.

The cabinets in the kitchen started opening in closing, we could hear the dishes falling to the floor and then we suddenly heard mike sisters screaming, we all ran out of his room across the hall into his sisters' room where they were both hiding in bed. At this point we were all scared and didn't know what to do. The closet doors in the bedrooms started opening and closing over and over just like the cabinets in the kitchen were, the lights were blinking on and off, along with the tvs, the water turning on and off and everything seemed to be out of control.

Since the doors in the girls room were being insane we didn't stay in there long, we all ran into the living room, we were all terrified. We all got on the couch together, threw blankets over our heads and just sat there. All the door slamming and what not stopped, it was somewhat quiet again so we got up and looked around as a group. Mikes bedroom door had deep gashes in it, like someone had taken a chisel to it and carved out the door along the grain, wood chips were everywhere. They were long flimsy strips of wood at least a foot long, it was unexplainable. The house was a total wreck from things falling out of cabinets, and off shelves, however, we came to notice nothing in mikes room had moved an inch save the carvings into the door, so we all piled up in there for the night.

Before we got ready to try and go back to sleep we decided to let the dog in to ""protect"" us, her name was lucky, she was a big white lab. We locked ourselves in mikes room and just as we were settling down with some movie on his little TV the power went out. Everything was quiet again. We heard the woman's voice coming from outside the door accompanied by what sounded like foot steps, every so often we would hear a thump, getting louder and louder as it got closer to the outside of the bedroom. Terrified we all sat curled up side by side watching the door. The scratching started briefly then stopped. Lucky started to wimper and she crawled under the bed which did nothing to boost our confidence. The door knob started to jiggle gently and then more violently in what seemed to be frustration, something started pounding on the other side of the door as the door knob shook more and more. Suddenly the door flung wide open, so hard the door knob punched a hole in the wall, then everything was still. It had stopped.

We all said a prayer, closed the door and eventually fell back asleep. This was not the only incident at this house OR one of the areas in the surrounding neighborhood. Frankly I get the chills recalling the memories, and writing them creeps me out. I enjoy hearing other experiences knowing I'm not totally insane.

We got blamed by her parents for what had happened to the house, and to this day that house still gets brought up every now and then when we see each other. I have many other stories about what has happened in that area as well as some of the other places I have visited. I recently went back (as an adult) to revisit my childhood stomping grounds. No one lives in that house and it looks just as demented and creepy as it did back then. I revisited the creek, the bridge, and some other places that I will write about later.

Maybe ill write about my reunion with that place next time, but for now I can surely say that the eerie feeling I get when I'm there hasn't changed a bit.

Seeing Is Believing,"Pennsylvania, United States",Photographs / Videos / EVP,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Photographs / Videos / EVP :: Seeing Is Believing

I was recently taking pictures of myself for my boyfriend. And I was using my web cam. I am not the greatest picture taker. The lighting in the room wasn't very good, the sun was streaming in through the curtains and the room was also dark.

So as usual I had to adjust the picture. You know the drill, lightening the picture and trying to rid the bright sun from the pictures. Of course I had to do some major adjusting of my pictures; being that I am the worse picture taker.

I wanted to take the best pictures as possible and tried to look my best. I figured any amateur could adjust the picture. It may take a little practice. So I would attempt to do this and send a few decent pictures to my boyfriend.

I made the attempt and the first ones seem to turn out decent. So I tried fixing the rest of them. And I was pretty excited at how the pictures had turned out. Yeah me! So I sent him the few pictures I had taken.

Of course he wanted more. And I waited a few days to send him the rest I had taken. However, the last ones I was going to send him seemed to be either too light or too dark. I tried to adjust them and it just didn't seem to turn out right. So I gave it one last attempt. And the picture I had the most problem with caught me by surprise.

It showed two people in it or some beings. I could see the legs of a person and the figure of another. The one I recognized as a female the other looked as though they had something in their hands.

I have often seen and experienced strange things. But this topped the cake. I now had proof of capturing this on tape. Seeing it makes a believer out of me. And the proof was now in my hands.

Someone on the Other Side of the Door,United Kingdom,Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: Someone on the Other Side of the Door

I am writing this on behalf of my 18 year old sister as she doesn't feel comfortable joining the site. It is only because I told her my story and where she could read it that she has come forward with her own experience.

About 3 week ago she was home alone at 2pm in her bedroom watching television with the bedroom door closed. She heard creaking on the landing floorboards at the same time as the front door sounding as though it was being opened then closed. The door has a very distinct sound, although no sound was heard on the stairs. She walked out of the bedroom to look at the bottom of the stairs (the front door is opposite the staircase) to see if it was me and my kids coming to visit (as apart from her, my mum, and my step dad I am the only one with a front door key) nobody was at the bottom of the stairs as nobody had come in. She then went back into the bedroom and still heard the creaking on the landing floorboards. This continued every few days for the next fortnight, the door however was only heard 3 more times.

Last week when she was in her room again with the door closed, she stood up to leave to go downstairs. As she approached the bedroom door she suddenly had an intense feeling that there was someone else on the other side of the door, she froze, sat on her bed and didn't leave the room for an hour! When she got the courage to open the door there was nobody there, as the feeling had left. There were always rumours about our parents house when we first moved in, about a boy in his bedroom either dying or committing suicide. We never listened though.

Now she gets feelings on most doors upstairs that there is someone on the other side of the door, or in her bedroom she thinks someone is in her doorway. She does have a belief in the after life, ghosts etc, she would just like to know other peoples thoughts on this.

My Shoes on Top in a Straight Line,"Florida, United States",Poltergeists / Physical Manifestations,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Poltergeists / Physical Manifestations :: My Shoes on Top in a Straight Line

I have recently written about happenings in my home and on two occasions now a ""funny"" thing has happened with my shoes. One day during the week of March 17th, my sister was over and we were watching a show on the Paranormal and the host was showing how to use a pendulum. He held a coin in his hand and if it was an odd number the pendulum moved left to right over his hand and if it was an even number it went to and fro.

So I got out mine and tried it and it worked. He then showed how to use a dowsing rod so I took my set out and was showing my sister how it worked. Well shortly after that, she had to go home and I had to get some sleep because I had to leave for work later that night. I work 11 pm to 7 am at a hospital. When we when to the front door my shoes were in the middle of the hall, one on top of the other if a very straight line. I usually keep these shoes under the kitchen table and put them on just before I go to work. The table is about 10 feet away from the hall.

We were wondering as to how it happened and my partner suggested that the dogs knocked the shoes into the hall when they were playing ball. I argued that the shoes would not be in a neat straight line and on top of each other, but rather scattered about. Well he said he was just stating that it could be how the shoes came to be in the hall, and that our ghost(s) don't always cause things to happen.

On Easter Sunday, we were telling the story to the family and once again we argued (in a joking manner) that was it the ghost or the dogs.

That night, while I was on the computer I also had a paranormal show playing on the tv. Shortly after that, I got into bed to watch a show with ""S"" and we decided we wanted popcorn, so I got up and put some in the microwave. Now when I go to the kitchen and walk back, I pass the hallway and there was nothing unusual at that time.

A few minutes into the show, we realized that it was a repeat so we turned off the TV and ""S"" decided to get some sleep, I being restless decided to get up and get a book from the living room. I got up and when I passed the hallway, there were my shoes again, in a straight line, on top of each other but closer to the front door. I called ""S"" to the hallway and he then agreed that the dog hadn't been playing ball, and also in the 10 minutes that had past since I made popcorn, it had to have happened and he and the dog were in the bedroom so they couldn't have done it.

One other thing about the shoes, when I picked them up I noticed just how tight they were shoved together, they weren't just placed on top of each other but toe into heel and jammed in tight.

So now every time I pass the hallway, I look to see if my shoes are there but so far it hasn't happened this week.

Feeling a Presence Around Me,Canada,Misc,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Misc :: Feeling a Presence Around Me

Y ou may have read my other story Beam Of Light , in it I say that I have not experienced or seen anything really weird, but that does not mean that I don't feel weird presences, or hear things.

I've said before that I go to a boarding school, which is apparently very haunted. I'm starting to believe it more and more. I don't know what it is, but ever since I came back from spring break, (which was a week ago) I've been having these really weird feelings that someone or something is around me, just watching. It's not occasional either, it's all the time, even when my roommates are with me in my room, I feel there is something around me. I don't get it though, how come I can't see it? Why hasn't it tried to communicate with me, I want to communicate with it! I've even said, ""If you do not have good intentions, please leave me alone..."" and ""If you do have good intentions, please talk to me..."" But nothing happens.

We sleep with all the lights off, and now I'm just so scared to do that, I never used to be afraid of the dark. I sleep alone in my room at home in the dark, with the door closed, and I am never afraid nor do I ever wake up in the middle of the night feeling that something is watching me, but at school I wake up in the night very often, feeling that a presence is around me.

Now, I have experienced one thing at my home that probably scared the living day lights out of me. I'm not used to paranormal activity so this really freaked me out. I was home alone, during the day and I was looking at my cupboard to see what I could eat, half day dreaming as well. When all of a sudden I heard someone yell my name very loud. It was a man, and it felt like they were outside in my yard. I turned around so quickly and no one was there, so I went to see if someone was in my yard and nothing. It couldn't have been my neighbours because they don't even know me, or my name.

Is there something following me? I played Ouija Board with my friend once, a couple of months ago, and apparently a boy named Thomas is with me at all times, (I had a imaginary boyfriend named Thomas as well which was really freaky). Is he trying to tell me something?

What should I do? I want to communicate with it, but it's not like I want to wake up in the middle of the night and see it standing at the foot of my bed. It's possible that I am just paranoid but what I heard was definitely something. I'm in desperate need of advice, please share your thoughts!

Imp Shaped Shadowy Figure,"Michigan, United States",Non Human Entities,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Non Human Entities :: Imp Shaped Shadowy Figure

A t the time I was searching for an apartment, my daughter also needed to move out of her apartment. I found the perfect place, in a big house that was converted into several apartments. We took the tour of the one at the lower right side of the house. We parked in the back, and used the back door to enter a large kitchen; I immediately fell in love with it.

Off of the kitchen to the right was the long narrow bathroom and to the left was a small living room. To the left of the living room was an extra large master bedroom, which I got an eerie feeling when I entered it, but quickly brushed it off as we left the room.

To the left of the living room was another small room with beautiful French doors. When I found out my daughter's boyfriend would also be moving in, I gave them the master bedroom and I crammed into the room with the French doors.

About a month later I started seeing a shadowy blur, or more like a gray fog, which at that time I knew was a spirit often rush past the door inside of the master bedroom, I just credited it to the possibly wandering of spirits from the cemetery a block up the road. I didn't feel and fear, and neither my daughter nor her boyfriend mentioned it, so I didn't worry about it.

One morning about 5:00 a.m., I walked into the living room heading for the bathroom as usual, and saw a shadowy, gray fog figure, shaped like the mythical imp demon. It clumsily hobbled as if its right hind leg was shorter than the left, and its left front leg was shorter than the right coming out of the master bedroom. I was used to seeing the shadowy things so I paid little attention to it until I had forgotten something. I turned to go back into my bedroom and noticed the figure seemed to back up. I retrieved the item from my room and the figure was in the living room in front of the master bedroom door. I consciously watched it out of the corner of my eye while facing straight ahead of me. It seemed to stay on the other side of the room exactly opposite me. I tested it and stepped forward the back and it stayed opposite me each time moving back and forth with me.

It was at this time that I realized I have never been so physically close (only two arm lengths away) to one of these shadowy figures and I've never seen one as an imp shape. I froze; I could see fairly clearly, a side view of the back of its head, its body, and tail. I wanted to get a better look and fear of the unknown arose at the idea of looking directly at it; wondering if you are supposed to look directly at these things and if I did would it have red glowing eyes that would freak me out. Since it seemed to match my movements would it look at me and freak me out or attack.

I overcame my 'what if fear' since the creature itself did not scare me and slowly turned my head in its direction. It did not face me; if stood there frozen in time, giving me the impression of an animal playing dead or a child with the idea 'maybe she won't see me' I don't know. Anyway at this point, it appeared to be shaped like a large lion with an unkempt mane. The body still on all fours did not show any straggling hairs/fur the tail, and it had no glowing eyes.

After about a half a minute, I turned my head back enough to still have somewhat of a visual as I moved toward the bathroom, it moved toward my room. In the straight path it was traveling it would have gone through the wall and into my room. After showering and getting dressed I needed to get back into my room. I slowly opened the door and looked on the side of the room it would have been and didn't see it. I looked around the rest of the room and saw nothing out of the ordinary. I step into the room, there was nor weird feelings. I went about my day as usual, but never forgot what I saw. I saw it often passing through the living room at different time of the day.

Most of my immediate family has seen a paranormal image (I call it the gift of sight) so I asked my daughter if she ever saw any ghosts in the apartment. She said yes and described it as a huge dog. I didn't think to ask her where in the apartment she saw it, is she was alone when she saw it, even if others were in others parts of the apartment, or if any of her company saw anything.

The Popular Classmate's Spirit,"Nevada, United States",Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: The Popular Classmate's Spirit

I n October of 2002, I moved into my very own townhouse. I was 19, and a single mother of a 1 year old. Well, when we first moved into the town home, my son was always afraid to sleep in his room as if he seen something. I decided to search through his room, cleaning out any junk from the boxes I had just moved-in. I came across a box with obituaries inside. These were obituaries of my father's mother, my cousin who was also on my father's side, and then a obituary of my classmate who had committed suicide by hanging herself. This box had been under my son's bed. I immediately removed it and put the obituaries in my room. My son is now 6 and since that move he hasn't been afraid to go into his room.

With that being said, let's move on to the weird encounters I, as well as my next door neighbor have had over the span of 5 years. First I'll begin with the classmate. Back in high school, there was a popular girl who everyone knew. She was in one of my classes and we may have said hi a few times.

Well 2 years later she supposedly went home, got a chair, and a rope and used it to hang herself. But rumors surfaced that she slipped and it was an accident. Soon after her funeral which I attended, my mom did a police report for a depressed Hispanic woman who you would never guess, was this girl's mother, because the girl was obviously mixed but she did not look Hispanic! Soon after, I started having dreams of my deceased classmate.

In every dream she's cold, her eyes glow, and she never moves. The girl's eyes are hazel and they were the most noticeable feature on her. Weird encounter: my ex who stayed with me off and on always claimed she seen a little girl. I never told her about my classmate until after. I believe the girl is her. She was only 15/16 5'2"" 105lbs or less. My next door neighbor claims that while we stood outside she looked up at my bedroom window and saw a figure with its head hanging to the side as if the figure was hanging. Note: I never told her about my classmate dying until after.

My neighbor and I stood at the bottom of my stairs. At the top is my bathroom as well as the bedrooms. Well we felt a strong cold breeze come from the top of the stairway. We looked at one another and froze. I said to her ""Oh! That's just the air..."" WRONG! 1 minute later the a/c came on. We immediately ran out of the house.

Another encounter: I called a friend up to come over. It was late and we were watching TV. She proceeded to use my phone but said that there was no dial tone, just dead air. (This was not a cell phone) I got on the phone in disbelief, like yeah right, I just called you to come over here so I know its working. I got on the phone and nothing! I tried everything. A few times I picked up the phone and it was just ringing for no reason. We immediately ran out of the house and got in her car and went to the gas station to use the payphone. I dialed my number, dead air. Dialed it again, no response.

So I waited a while and the phone was busy. I called my mom who is religious as well as what people call clairvoyant. I told her something was wrong with my phone and told her to meet me back at my house. I arrived home and tried to use the phone again, nothing.

My Mother arrived a few minutes later. I was panicking and angry. I handed my mom the phone and said ""See Mom, this stupid phone isn't working!"" She took it and pressed talk. She replies ""What are you talking about? It's working just fine, see!"" And it was dial tone and all. Ok so my friend and I calmed down. As soon as she left, we got back on the phone and dead air once again...

The Apartment Man,"Pennsylvania, United States",Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: The Apartment Man

U p until this past summer, my boyfriend has lived in an apartment in Allentown, PA. We started to date over two years ago, recently after he had moved in. I was a second semester sophomore at a college that was an hour away. My roommate and I did not get along, and we were going through an especially hard time. I needed to get away from her, so my boyfriend allowed me to come and spend the weekend at his apartment.

That Saturday he had to work a 10 hour shift, so I brought all my homework, a good book, and some movies to keep me busy until he returned home at night. Before this I had not spent much time at his apartment so I was not worried about spending the day there by myself.

I had got there that Friday night and everything was fine. We had discussed what we were going to do the next day. Since he would be leaving for work early the next morning, he told me that he would not wake me up. He told me that if I get bored and wanted to go anywhere that he would lock the door as he left and slip the key for me through the mail slot. The apartment complex that he lived in was not in the safest area in town, so he kept the door locked at all times, especially when I was there.

The next morning came, and since I am such a light sleeper, I woke up before he left. I had said goodbye to him and witnessed him locking the door and slipping me the key through the mail slot. This was the only key he had to get into the apartment, so he was officially locked out at that point. I was still really tired so I decided to go back to bed for a few more hours before I got up to get some of my work done. I do not recall how long it was after I had dozed off that I was awakened by a noise.

In my tired state, I did not think much of it and closed my eyes. I then heard what sounded like walking through the apartment. I had opened my eyes just in time to see a person peaking in at me and walked right back out. Since I had been sleeping, my eyes did not adjust quick enough to see clearly who it was. The figure looked like my boyfriend, so I figured he had forgot something in the apartment and peaked in to make sure I was ok. I then heard him walk down the stairs and out the door.

After that, I decided to get up for the day, still thinking that what had just happened was my boyfriend. I got dressed, cleaned and watched some movies to try to keep myself occupied. For some reason, I just did not feel right. I felt really tired and constantly had the feeling of butterflies in my stomach. I had no idea why I felt this way, so I convinced myself that it was just the stresses of school hitting me.

Around lunch time I decided to go down the street to grab something to eat. It was at this moment, when I walked down the stairs and saw the keys on the ground, that I watched my boyfriend put through the mail slot, that I knew the person who peaked in on me was not my boyfriend. There was no way that he could have gotten back in after I watched him leave the first time. I started to get really scared. A ghost was not the first thought that ran through my head, I thought it might have been the management of the apartment building (who do have keys to get in) coming in to check on something. All day I had convinced myself that that was what it was.

The feelings of anxiousness when I got back into the apartment after lunch made me feel really sick. I laid down on the couch and watched some television to calm my nerves, but this feeling never went away. It was not until my boyfriend returned home that I finally felt a sense of calm and peace. I had told him what had happened. I first asked to make sure that it was definitely not him. He assured me that after he had left that morning that he never came back until after work. He also told me that if it had been the management they would have had to notify him first by calling, so it was not them.

We stopped talking about it for a while. It was not until after dinner that he told me that his two friends, who had spent the night a few times out in the living room, had experienced a figure of a man walking in the hallway. This of course freaked me out, but I refused to believe that he was telling the truth and was just trying to scare me.

After that day, I always got a sense of anxiousness when I hung out in his apartment, especially when I was alone. More than once I had seen a bright yellowish white light zoom passed the hall entrance from the living room heading towards the front door. I also, more than once, had objects move to a different place that I had put them when I would go to a different room. I always tried to convince myself that it was my imagination.

One day my boyfriend left me alone in the apartment to go over to his neighbor's apartment to drop something off. I was not too fond of his neighbor so I had to pick the lesser of two evils, so I decided to stay in the apartment by myself. I didn't mind being alone during the day but once it started to get dark out I did not want to be alone in that apartment. He was gone for a longer amount of time than I had thought he would be. I had gone into the kitchen to get something to drink when I heard what I thought was my boyfriend coming up the stairs. I did not hear the front door open but I figured that was because I was rummaging through the fridge trying to find a bottle of juice. I walked out into the living starting to talk to him, but I noticed he was not there. I then checked the bedroom and the bathroom, but he was still no where to be found. I went over to the window to look outside and I saw him just leaving his neighbors house. I knew for a fact that he could not have walked upstairs and back down again (without me hearing the door open and close), walk across the street and to his neighbor's apartment between the time that I heard the sound of the steps and the time I got over to the window.

This is when I officially got really freaked out. I ran down the stairs and out the door. It took a good three hours for him to convince me to go back inside and that everything was ok. I refused from that point on to be left alone in that apartment at any time of the day.

I still have not been able to explain what I heard that day or the different experiences I had the entire time he lived there. The day I helped him move out of his apartment, was the first time since the first experience I had, that I felt comfortable there. The sense of relief that filled my body when we loaded the last box into the van this summer was so overwhelming, that I almost cried. I have never experienced a place giving me that much of a negative feeling before, and never had I ever experienced anything quite like that.

A Gift from the Other Side,Malta,Family / Friends Visits,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Family / Friends Visits :: A Gift from the Other Side

T his literally just happened today 1st april 2008, and no it is not an april fools joke. I was talking to my dad on the phone and he told me that the most amazing thing had just happened to him. He had been out with his friends and arrived home at about 5 in the morning when he found that the statue we keep on the t.v. fell on the ground, although this always happens even though there are many statues on the t.v., this is the only one that falls.

My dad then went to sit on the bed when he noticed a strange flower lying on the bed, my dad decided he would ask my grandmother in the morning if she had placed the flower there. He then lay on the bed and just as he was about to sleep, he felt someone gently touch him although no one else was in the room.

In the morning ny dad went to see my grandmother upstairs and ask her if she had placed the flower on his bed but she couldn't have as she is 90 and finds it difficult to walk, he then spoke to my aunt about it and she told him that she didn't even go in his bedroom.

One very strange thing that happened since the manifestation of the flower is that for the first time in 3 years my grandmother actually said she was happy when asked how she was feeling usually she always replied that she was depressed or lonely. My dad was also filled with joy and happiness and everyone noticed it.

I truly believe that this flower is a gift from God or someone who is watching (maybe my deceased grandfather) over us to tell us not to despair and to have faith and be happy.

Sorry if my story is not scary though my experiences are never scary but rather comforting and show that even after our loved ones leave us they are never truly gone.

Pepe's Unfortunate Fate,Philippines,Family / Friends Visits,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Family / Friends Visits :: Pepe's Unfortunate Fate

A s a little girl I loved hearing ghost stories (I still do). This tragic story I'm about to tell is of my dad's. I have always thought that my dad just made it all up, until I heard it from another relative. So on to the story.

This happened way back when my dad was still in grade school. I think he was just about 10 or 11 then. Back then the land where my house is standing now was the shore. Nothing but sand and sea. After coming home from school my dad and his friends would go straight to the water and catch some fish (the water was just knee high and they use their bare hands), given on account that their houses were just a few meters away and times was hard then, kids had to work for food.

So after a few hours of catching fish, it was finally getting dark. My dad and two of his friends stayed behind because of the luck they're having, good catch don't come often.

One of dads friend, Pepe, ventured a little far from my dad and his other friend. Having too many fish to hold, he decided to put one in his mouth, head first! Which is not a good idea, and he found that out a little later. When the fishes tail touched the water, when he bent down to search for more fish, it started to wiggle, and it being in his mouth, pushed itself to Pepe's throat. My dad and his other friend suddenly noticed Pepe struggling to breath.

My dad ran to Pepe and tried everything to pull the fish out of Pepe's mouth but he couldn't, the fishes head (the blade like thingy that opens when they breath) kept on hooking on his tonsils. The other friend panicked and ran away (so much of a friend).

So my dad was left there with his dying friend. My dad didn't know what to do but he had the mind to carry Pepe on his back to look for help. While walking or running he felt his friend getting heavier and heavier. To make it shorter Pepe died on my dads back.

So here's the scary part. After all that has happened my dad somehow got the chance to forget about that ordeal. But not long after forgetting. One night he woke up to take a whizz, on the way to the bathroom he heard a faint voice not sure who or what it was he stopped and he listened, it got louder and clearer, calling my dad. It was saying ""condring"" (my dads nickname) ""help me"" ""help me"". Horror-stricken my dad turned his head to where the sound was coming from. There and then he saw his dead friend all pale with both arms raised reaching asking for help. My dad ran to his parents room. And since then he never went to pee on his own.

Sorry for the long story I have the tendency to be specific. Hope you enjoyed it somehow.

Foul Smelling Thing,Canada,Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: Foul Smelling Thing

I t was Easter of 2006 and I went to Calgary Canada to visit my parents and little brother. I used to live in Calgary, but moved to Los Angeles with my girlfriend when I turned 19. A month before my girlfriend and I drove up to Calgary for the Easter weekend, my parents and brother moved to a new place, a little closer to the city center. This is an older area of the city, not my favorite part of town, but it's a little more affordable I guess.

I remember every weekend talking to my brother, Chris, and he would always say that he hated the vibe he would get every time he would come home from school and had to be home alone. He described a few of the events that take place, like lights turning off and on, and the cat hissing at what appeared to be nothing.

Well, he was right... The house was a little messed up. The minute my girlfriend and I walked in the door, we felt very uneasy. It felt like we were walking into a very angry environment.

Just before dinner we were all sitting in the family room, enjoying some drinks and catching up on everything, when I noticed the cat pacing back and forth, stopping occasionally to look at the basement door that was left open about an inch or so. After a while the cat got a little closer to the door and started hissing and growling, hackles standing straight up. Chris grabbed the cat and brought it into the family room with us. The cat sat on his lap and kept his eye on the basement door.

I think a half hour passed when we heard a loud SLAM! The cat booked it out of the room and upstairs. I whipped around and looked towards where the sound had come from and noticed that the basement door was closed.

Chris pointed at the door and looked at me and said ""See? I told you this place was F***** up!"" Then I remembered that Chris spends a lot of his time home alone... This would definitely be pretty spooky if it was an everyday thing.

The events that followed later that night were also quite eventful. My girlfriend and I were exhausted from our drive so we decided to go to bed. I woke up around 2:30am and noticed Geri (My girlfriend) wasn't in bed. I got up to use the bathroom where I found Geri, with her face in the toilet bowl. I asked her if she was alright. She replied ""Yes"" then asked me if I ""Could smell that...""

She said ""That rotten smell. It's like... Rotting meat or garbage or something...""

I told her I didn't smell anything, and I waited with her until she was able to go back to bed.

After we crawled back into bed we heard the cat scurry up the stairs, followed by a prolonged creaking sound. Geri and I both looked at each other for a moment, and then we heard a loud SLAM! We could hear footsteps on the main floor, and I began to smell the faint odor of rotting meat. Geri could also smell it. The footsteps made their way up the stairs and the smell got worse.

I remember looking over at Geri and she had vomited on the comforter. When the footsteps reached the top of the stairs the ""thing"" began to pass by our room. Geri claims she saw a large black figure pass by... I didn't see anything.

When the ""thing"" got to the end of the hall we heard Chris yell ""Oh Hell no! I'm getting so F***ing sick and tired of this S***!""

Of course, the entire house was awake and everyone rushed to Chris's room. He was out of bed, he looked very disoriented and as pale as could be. It was at this point everyone in the house began feeling uncomfortable. Then there was a scraping sound that made its way back down the hall, down the stairs, and into the basement... Followed by yet another slam of the door.

The family agreed we would go to a motel for the night. Chris looked around for the cat for about 20 minutes while everyone got dressed and ready to go and couldn't find him. Dad told him he'll be fine until morning. So we all got in the van and left... When we returned in the morning the house was filled with a disgusting odor...

We packed up as fast as we could and loaded everything into a Uhaul. My family came back down to Cali with us, they lived with us for about a month until they found a little house on the beach. My brother is living with Geri and I...and yes we found the cat, he's here safe and sound... For now, my rotweiler Harley doesn't care for him too much.

Ghost From a Former Life,Netherlands,Poltergeists / Physical Manifestations,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Poltergeists / Physical Manifestations :: Ghost From a Former Life

L et's start with some background information. I am Merwin Meibos, I'm 17 years old and I live in Holland. I have lived in a place called Mildam my whole life until we moved to Heerenveen two years ago. In Mildam I had never encountered any paranormal sightings or anything, so as you can guess I was very pessimistic about the idea of ghosts running around.

However, as a child, I can remember a ghostly image that used to talk to me (I was 6 or 7 years old). She used to tell me stories about my former life, and I never had felt scared when I was around her. Now, I can't remember a lot, but I will try to remember as much as possible (keep in mind, these are memories of 10 years ago, so maybe its a little bit silly).

In my former life, I was a stealing lowlife, someone that had a scar and 1 earring (funny detail, I was born with a little hole in my right ear, so the doctors called me pirate, and 4 years ago I got a scar from running through a glass door). I did many bad things, and I won't tell details but one of them was falling in love with a married lady (probably my ""ghostly image""). I once kissed her, when her husband was at home, and when he found out, he probably killed me (she didn't want to talk about it). Obviously, she felt something for me too, because when she died, she first had to be around me again.

I told my mother about her regularly, but she had always thought it was my imaginary friend, because I had problems finding proper friends when I was 7. When I grew older, I couldn't see her anymore, so I also chalked it up as a stupid mind trick or something. Nowadays, I'm not so sure anymore, because some strange things have happened in my new room.

The first thing began about a year ago, when my room was finished (my father rebuilt almost every room when we moved in). At night, I could hear knocking sounds from my wall on the right or ticking sounds from my gas stove. At first this didn't scare me, because I could explain these sounds. Nowadays, these sounds scare the hell out of me, because I know what happens, when they go on for a long time.

When that happens, first my speakers start to make a scratching sound (I have a computer in my room, with 2 speakers), not very loud, because my parents never heard it. Next thing are the curtains, they start to move slowly, like the wind is playing with it, only there's no wind. The last thing, is this feeling of being scared, mixed with the feeling like something is watching you. After that, it stops immediately, leaving me in my bed, almost drowning in my own cold sweat, not able to sleep another minute. I haven't told this to my parents, because they don't believe in ghosts anyway.

About 3 months ago, I found out why these things start. Its because I think about the wrong things. I know how stupid this sounds, but every time I start thinking about hitting someone I would really like to punch in the face, the sounds begin. I strongly believe that the ghost can read my mind, and that's why I called it Teacher ghost, because teachers punish you to, when they hear a boy would like to punch someone else in the face.

I'm not sure, but maybe this is still the lady from when I was 7, and maybe this is her way to ensure I won't ever do bad things again. If I'm correct, I thank her, and frankly, I don't want her to leave, because I have loved her in a past life.

Ghost of a Boy,United Kingdom,Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: Ghost of a Boy

T his is another tale of my mother's, and two of my aunts as well! When she was young she lived in a pretty small house with two of her sisters, one of her brothers and her parents - in a three bedroom house this naturally meant that people were going to have to share. So, the parents had one room, the girls had another, and the boy had the third. It become a tradition whilst the other children were growing up that the eldest got the room to themselves; to promote the idea of independence, give them privacy, and so on.

Well, the boy grew into a man and moved out, and the first of the sisters - my aunt, who ended up getting very involved in the occult - moved into the third bedroom. She lasted about a week before refusing point blank to enter the room again. She was quite high-strung, and obstinate, so she got her way. She told my mom, the second eldest, that someone was watching her whenever she was in there, and that they had moved her stuff around whilst she was still in the room behind her back.

Now, my mom was very impressionable, but very practical. She couldn't get out of staying in the room - her parents barely tolerated the intelligent superstar that was her sister refusing to obey and they would have just told her she was being ridiculous. So, she moved into the room despite being terrified of the ghost, or demon as she thought it, and got ready for her first night there.

She did, however, apologize to the empty air for moving in, and said that she hoped not to be a nuisance. After all, she reasoned, it didn't seem to be able to move rooms and having someone rattle around might get irritating. So, sensing the same feeling of being watched as her sister, she carried on, more afraid of her parents reaction if she ran out that the ghost. Lying down in the bed, she closed her eyes tight shut and said goodnight to the ghost, and refused to open them until morning.

She says that she felt someone brush her hair back, very very gently, and that they didn't seem mean or cruel at all despite what her elder sister said. It was the only time that she ever felt them touch her in any way, but she often felt their presence.

She moved out years later after getting married, having had no problem with the ghost. The elder sister did some research into the house, and found out that the previous owners had a son who was born with Downs Syndrome, and that was his room and he had died there (which had resulted in the parents selling the house). She thinks it was this boy who was the ghost.

The youngest sister, by the way, never moved into the room as she was the youngest child as well, taking away the ""eldest moves in"" reason - she also got married and moved out before my mom did. She tells me that she hated that room, and was sure there was someone in there; she didn't go in unless ordered. The uncle also says that there might have been someone there, but he ignored it.

Ghosts are Stalking Me,"I need to... Wash the dishes without interruption right now. Or whatever it is that you would rather be doing. If you are visiting with friends, ask them (the ghosts) to please leave you alone during this time as you are interested in the meeting with your friend and you do not want them to be scared by either your reaction to the ghosts visit, or by experiencing something themselves., American Samoa",Psychic / Medium,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Psychic / Medium :: Ghosts are Stalking Me

J ust to get this straight, me being followed by ghost 99% of the time is completely my fault. Ghosts have always been something interesting to study about and I have always believed in. But lately the feeling of them being around me has gotten stronger. Sure its fun to read about them and talk to them, until they start stalking you.

Of course I have all the bad luck, I can't see them until its totally dark so I make sure there is always some light everywhere I go at night. What really scares me though is the feeling they give of it is not a good one. I also know that I am not imaging it.

A few days ago at lunch I went up to the porch at school to check the time when I suddenly felt as if someone grabbed my neck it did not hurt or anything, but I couldn't breathe. I ran of the porch as soon as I was back around other people, I could breathe again but my senses could still feel that thing near by. I told my friends about it, then my friend Lisa (not her real name), told me I had to fingerprints on my neck. It freaked me out even more.

We sat down near the lake, about five to six yards away, then suddenly I felt a ghost crowd around me, I knew that people have drowned and died near there but they were crowding so close to me it was like I was being smothered. It bugged me and frightened me, but they didn't leave me alone instead they followed me home.

That was annoying and now I have trouble sleeping because the sense of their hate kept me awake for fear of going to sleep. And the weird thing is I am usually a very positive person.

He Saw his Father Leave his Body,United Kingdom,Psychic / Medium,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Psychic / Medium :: He Saw his Father Leave his Body

I 'm writing this on behalf of a close friend of mine and I think it's a really beautiful story. My friend Fran's father was diagnosed with cancer two years ago and got to a point in February 2007 where he was told by his Doctors that he had one month left to live. All his family gathered around him: his wife, his siblings, his children (including Fran) and his grandchildren. A curate (an English Vicar) came as well, on the last day of his life, and the whole family prayed by him.

In the last moments of his life, Fran saw the curate get up slowly and start packing up his things. He wondered why the hell he was leaving just at the point his father was about to die, but he then saw something utterly baffling: His father got up slowly too, looked him straight in the eye and smiled, then walked gently out of the room following the curate. Fran watched them both leave through the bedroom door and as they left he heard the curate saying to his father, ""all will be well now..."" Fran doesn't know if this was actually said out loud to his father, or he heard it in his head from another realm.

Obviously the whole experience was overwhelming for Fran, and even more overwhelming when he saw his father's body still lying on the bed with all his family around it crying. I had tears in my eyes when Fran told me this, and to this day he maintains that he wasn't in shock at the time he saw these things, because he had already had a lot of time to grieve and accept the fact that his father was going to die. Fran doesn't tell many people this story and now the afterlife is something he feels he just ""knows..."" Since this experience with seeing his father leave his body, he has had many more psychic experiences, and we've also had a few experiences together.

It proves to me that when you're open, calm and relaxed in a loving atmosphere, whatever your religion, these things just happen as part of the fabric of everyday life. Maybe sometimes we're too caught up in the grieving and loss felt in ""earthly"" life to actually be able to see that life does go on after death.

I just thought this story would be a nice, loving, relieving break from some of the terrifying (but excellent!) stories on here.

Uncle Johnny Came Back?,"New York, United States",Family / Friends Visits,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Family / Friends Visits :: Uncle Johnny Came Back?

U ncle Johnny was my favorite Uncle. So too was his sister my favorite Aunt. As was things in the old days children often lived with their parents when not married, even when they were older.

I grew up next door in a small (actually tiny) house on their property. We were all very close. Uncle Johnny and his sister were like second parents to me. As I grew up he would show me everything he knew about building and fixing things. But as life would have it I would go away to Military School and then move to Pennsylvania. We visited but not as much as I would have liked.

Then one day as I was coming home. I saw my father leaving with my sister to get my mother from work. His only words to me were to stay in the house until he returned and that Uncle Johnny and Bill were dead. A million things ran through my mind of how it could have happened. Car accident, some type of accident at home. What could have killed both of them? To my shock it was natural causes.

My uncle had worked on Friday and had Saturday off. As usual he went out that evening after work with friends and came home around 1am. They all heard him come up stairs. He followed his normal routine as usual, used the bathroom, washed up and then went to bed closing his door behind him. This night he mistakenly closed the door very hard, no one knows why. The next morning my Aunt got up early and went into the City to go shopping and his parent's let my uncle sleep in, since it was his day off.

Around noon my uncles mother (great aunt) decided to wake him up. She went to his room and called. No answer. After several attempts, knocking on the door and no answer she decided to enter the room. There was my uncle lying peacefully in his bed. She went up to him to shake him awake and instantly knew he was dead.

She ran to the window and screamed to her husband that she thought their son was dead. His father ran into the house and up the stairs to his wife. When the father reached the top step he had a massive heart attack and dropped dead at his wife's feet. Understandably, she lost all control, ran into the street yelling and crying, and a police car stopped to help. She never rebounded from the ordeal and died little more than a month later, leaving my aunt Nina alone.

After all this tragedy we thought it was over until about 6 months later. I drove back to NYC to visit my aunt one weekend with my soon to be wife. We did the normal stuff. Chit Chat, dinner etc. I decided to stay the night and leave the next morning. When it came time for bed my aunt said I could sleep in her room since I knew about my uncle dying in his room. I told her it didn't bother me if I stayed in my uncle Johns room but she insisted I didn't. She then said it was ok since she no longer slept upstairs. Mainly because she couldn't get her Doberman to go upstairs after everyone died. She said things were going on but wouldn't elaborate. So I went to her room and my wife to be went to my uncle John's room. (we didn't tell her) I went to bed with the door open. My aunts open door faced the top landing. I could clearly see the hall light at the top of the stairs. It was a low wattage bulb and the hall was dimly lit but could be seen clearly.

I was just about asleep when an upstairs door slammed shut hard. It startled me and I sat up. All of a sudden, the light in the hall seemed to fade out but it wasn't the light. There, standing in the doorway to my room, was the figure of a man. I could clearly see the lit hallway behind it but since it was backlit by the hall light, I could not make out any features. Everything around this shadow type silhouette was clear. It looked exactly like someone put a cardboard cutout of a man in the doorway.

I was just frozen. I don't know if I was scared, paralyzed or what. I just sat there for what seemed like forever staring at this thing. It never moved but, finally just kind of faded away before my eyes. I hadn't fallen asleep yet so I know it wasn't a dream. After that everything was calm and I finally went to sleep after a long while of popping back up to see if it came back.

The next morning I went downstairs for breakfast and asked who slammed the door. My wife to be said it woke her up and she thought it was me. My aunt was sleeping at the bottom of the stairs on the couch with the dog at her side but said she heard nothing. I don't know how she couldn't have heard it. I never did tell my aunt what I saw but years later after she moved she admitted things happened in the house but never would go into it. We remained close for many years later and I even lived with her after my divorce at the end of her life. Not until then did I find out how afraid of dying she was. She was one of those people who are terrified of death to the point of not even wanting to speak of it. Which is why I guess she never spoke of her old house and the incident. She passed away in 2000 in such a way that she knew she was dying right to the last second. I was there and the look of terror on her face made my blood run cold. I miss her very much and still have feelings of guilt to this day that I couldn't help her at the end.

The old house is no longer there but, I am curious if the new home that is there, has any activity?

Bob's Back,"New Hampshire, United States",Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: Bob's Back

I t would seem that Bob is getting a bit restless as of lately. It been awhile since anything memorable has happened in our apartment ( Our new apartment and Bob's at it again ).

Now all of a sudden in the last 3 weeks things have been going a bit on the weird side.

Two Saturdays ago, I was washing dishes, my daughter was on the computer, my husband was sitting at the island in our kitchen and my son was sleeping. The house phone starts to ring. I asked my daughter who was it (we have caller id) and she said she doesn't know, it wasn't coming up on the caller id box or on the headset. Ok, a bit odd but, it could happen. So, I told her to answer it. Which she does and then looks at me weirdly and hangs up the phone, I asked her what that was about and she says ""you know when you call your own number and hang up that recording you get when it rings back"" and I said yeah she said it was that.

So, now she has our attention. Then at that moment my cell phone rings, which is upstairs in my bedroom. My husband runs up to get it and comes back down with a puzzled look and hands me my phone. I look at it and the caller id shows that it is ""home"" calling. Now we are looking at each other (my son is still sleeping upstairs, first thing we thought of too) and my phone stops ringing and then my voice mail beeps. I turn on speaker phone and check my voice mail and there was one new message but nothing was there.

The next thing happened a week ago today. I went to go take a shower, it was about 6:00 a.m. And the body wash was missing from the shower. This puzzled me because the bottle was 1/2 full. So, I used my daughters and continued with my day and forgot all about it.

The next day I was getting a towel to go and take a shower, while talking to my kids and I remembered so, I asked them if they knew where it was. And of course they both knew nothing about it. So, I went and got a new bottle from the closet and took my shower.

Later that afternoon my cat was trying to squeeze into a space between our refrigerator and the counter and when I looked to see what he was trying to get, there was my 1/2 used bottle of body wash just sitting there.

The latest thing this week. My son spent the night at his buddies' house. The next morning he calls me and we chatted and then he asks me ""So what did you want?"" I said ""I give up, you called me..."" He then proceeded to tell me that my cell number was on his phone as a missed call and that there was a voice mail message but, there was nothing there but a few seconds of noise from a TV. I never called my son.

Spirit with a Motherly Attitude in County Sligo,Ireland,Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: Spirit with a Motherly Attitude in County Sligo

T his account is taken from my mother's diary where she recorded many paranormal experiences through her life. This is an accurate account. On the 11th May 1971 my mother was staying at her aunt's house in County Sligo with her toddler sister. This was my mother's birthday. Before I begin to narrate this story I must give some information about the house in which she was staying. It is in the Lissadell Estate which was owned by the Gore Booth family.

The place is riddled with spirits from the Irish Famine which wiped out the majority of the local tenants. This particular house was lived in by an unknown Irish family of tenant farmers. All the information that was known about them is that their five children died of starvation in the house and their parent's immigrated to America.

The following is a commonly believed tale about the house. An English aristocrat visited the estate and died suddenly (presumed heart failure) in the kitchen of the house. Why an aristocrat would want to visit a tenant farmers house is a mystery. With these two legends in mind, I begin my narrative. After the small celebration which was held for my mother's birthday; she and her sister were sent to bed. The room in which they slept in is now nicknamed ""The Cold Room...""

The walls were not decorated with anything other than fading pink wall paper and picture which gave the ominous impression that its eyes followed you as you walked past. The pair shared a double bed for the night. Her young sister, since she was so young; fell asleep quickly. My mother did not sleep but stayed awake; thinking of the history and legends associated with the house. Eventually she fell into a light slumber.

She was awakened by soft footsteps which beat with a loud, steady rhythm. My mother knew immediately that the footsteps were created by someone wearing boots. She thought it was her aunt since she always wore boots so she was not scared. The sounds approached the bed where she and her sister lay. My mother shut her eyes to pretend she was asleep because she knew that her aunt would scold her for not being awake. A strange coldness saturated the air and she heard whispers. The words were illegible but the voice was not her aunt's but it was a woman's voice. She heard the unknown woman kiss her sleeping sister. My mother claimed she felt nauseous with terror. The footsteps seemed to turn and leave in the same style of rhythm as they had came. My mother awoke her sister and asked her had she felt or seen anything? She said no.

The same thing happened three times during the one night, the third time my mother looked at the woman. She was just a blurred shadow like figure but looked very solid. The cold emanated from the human shaped form. She watched her kiss her sister on the forehead and walked out with long strides.

My mother thoroughly questioned her aunt about whether she came into her room that night. Her aunt swore by the bible (swearing by the bible meant a lot to people at that time) that she did not once enter the room that night.

My mother never again had to sleep in that room so she has seen nothing more of the ""motherly ghost"" which she named it. She was rather perplexed that she did not see any spirits relating to the aforesaid legends which she was expecting to encounter.

Thirty nine years later my mother and I visited the old house. It was completely refurbished with many building extensions added on to the original structure but the room was still the same. Not in appearance but in its sinister atmosphere. It was terribly cold and dark even though the summer sun was shining through the wide window. Her cousin who now owns the house said ""No matter what we do the room never heats up...""

I was impressed by this account especially since I had the opportunity to inspect the scene of the event many years after the incident happened. It certainly seems a place where a haunting could be in operation.

Strange Whispers Calling my Name,"California, United States",Old Hags / Night Attacks / Sleep Paralysis,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Old Hags / Night Attacks / Sleep Paralysis :: Strange Whispers Calling my Name

T his is my fist post and I am quite excited. I have had this problem for as long as I can remember and MAYBE some of you can help me out with it. I keep experiencing these strange whispers, strange because they are calling my name. I would think it is my subconscious mind playing tricks but last night something different occurred and it really scared me.

As I prepared to go to sleep, just as I linger on the brink of being asleep and being awake I hear my name being called. It has happened to me a countless number of times. Every time I experience this I become extremely tired. I am to afraid to go to sleep because I feel that whatever is calling my name will take over me. It never fails that although I am not asleep, I know this because I can look at the clock and see the time pass, I can't move.

I can't call out to anyone to help me and it feels as if I am locked in my mind. The drowsiness is so heavy and complete. I feel as if it drains all of the energy I have in me to stay awake.

Last night when this happened I thought it was just my sister talking in her sleep, because it hasn't happened to me anywhere except at my mom's house (until last night), but as soon as I had that thought, the name changed and it started saying my sister's name. It was so strange because it was like it could hear what I was thinking, and when I thought ""Oh No not this"", it's like I could feel its pleasure, actually feeding off of my fear. I don't know what it is but it feels really dark and evil and the only thing that seems to release me from it is calling on the name of Jesus.

First Encounter With a Little Blue Orb,"Virginia, United States",Orbs / Lights / Mists,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Orbs / Lights / Mists :: First Encounter With a Little Blue Orb

B efore I tell you the story, just let me tell you: If you think that ghosts aren't real, please don't post rude comments. No comment will change my mind about what I saw and hear with my own eyes and ears. Call me crazy and stupid, but I will not change my mind. Also, I'm not one to lie to my friends. Those of you who know me well should know that I don't lie. And for thoes of you who do believe, I hope this interests you some. With those words said... on to the story!

Let me give you guys a setting. Small square room. Bed on the far side, away from the door. Bed under the window and facing so you could see into the walk-in doorless closest. All the curtains were shut. No street lights shine in on my room either.

So, it was about 3:30am my cat was sitting beside my bed and I reached over to pet him. My eyes wander over to the closet. I see a little blue circle glowing in there. I draw back and hide under my cover (such a coward) I get enough courage to look at it again. I stare at it for a few minutes. I notice that it can't be the light from the TV shining in on my walls for two reasons:

1. I have no mirrors that would reflect in that direction and

I stare at it every once in a while for about an hour before I reach over and turn on my lights. I look over to where its at and its gone. There wasn't anything glow-in-the-dark. Just the bottoms of two shirts hanging in my closet. They weren't even blue and they had no tags.

After that I get up and get ready for school, I have some extra time, so I get on the computer and look up spiritual orbs, I hear little house noises and I don't care about it until one unusually loud sounds right behind me in the corner of the room.

Freaked out, I run into the living where my dad is asleep. You know when doors aren't all the way closed they are just leaning on their little lock thing that sticks out? Go look at you door then. Well, our bathroom door is screwed up so it doesn't close right unless you shove it.

A few hours earlier my dad went to the bathroom and didn't close the door all the way. About 10 or so minutes after I run into the living room (and watch lilo and stich) The door bounces open and shut. It was about 15ft away from me. I let the cat out when I was at the computer. So I have no idea what could've cause that.

There was also something else, I'm not sure if I imagined this one, I was pretty shaken, or it was just my dad twitching, but I thought I saw little indents on the blanket coming down from the back of the couch. Like a cat. That one I'm not too sure about. I was very paranoid at the moment so It could've possibly been my imagination.

All of this occurred this morning. I've never had any paranormal experiences, but my sister and dad have. Also my mom claims to feel something in the living room at about 1:30pm (no its not gas!). I think I might've witnessed stuff because the night before our landowner came to fix the leaking ceiling and left a big hole in the ceiling. I think that may have disrupted the spirits. Tonight I am so going to sleep with a camera at hand so I can take pics if shark-bait comes back! (lol yes my friend and I named the orb) I might even try to touch it.

I have always believed in ghosts but never thought that my house was haunted. But one night, I had a vivid dream that took place in my house. I dreamt I was another person running from something. The furniture in my dream was different and looked older than the furniture that was in my house at the time. I woke up and for some reason, I was really terrified.

Shortly after, I would hear things like footsteps, doors opening/closing, and occasionally, heavy breathing at night. It always took place around two in the morning. Eventually, I started going to bed earlier and would be asleep at that time so I would not hear it. But on the occasional nights where I would be awake, I would hear those noises.

Once my mom's boyfriend moved in however, all strange noises stopped. I volunteered to let him have my room, so that meant that I had to sleep in the basement. I moved all of my things down there. Once he moved out, I was comfortable down there and decided to stay.

Shortly after he left though, I started hearing those noises again. This time they were louder and distinctly closer to me than they were when I slept upstairs. Once, I'd even heard what sounded like someone stomping on the stairs going down into my room, but when I look, nothing is there.

For a while it was only noises, but eventually it started to turn a bit more frightening. There are two rooms to my basement, one is the room I sleep in and the other is a storage room, sometimes the door to the storage room would be unlocked and open. At first I thought it was just my mom or sister going to get something, but the few times I've asked them about it and they say that they didn't go in. Also, there have been times when my new personal heater would not shut off... Until I would get up and turn on the lights.

Once when I was investigating a noise that sounded like heavy breathing from my bed, I saw someone in the corner. It was a shadowy silhouette of a tall man. At first I thought it was in intruder, so I turned to get a weapon and when I looked up, he was gone. It was a little past two. My room is not big, and there is nowhere to go except for up the stairs or into the storage room. I was only turned away for two seconds at the most. I did not hear anyone run up the stairs, nor did not hear the storage door open (it is very noisy, takes a lot of force to open, and was across the room from the shadow.)

Another time, I had a friend spend the night. (I did not tell him about the noises or what I had seen.) I fell asleep before he did. The next morning, he told me that around two he thought he heard someone whistling. He looked to see if it was me, but it wasn't. He said that he looked up and saw a dark, tall, silhouette standing in the corner. He said that he tried to wake me up but I wouldn't move. When he looked back, the shadow was gone.

One night, I came home from my neighbor's around two in the morning. I was not tired because I'd taken a long nap that day. Walking up to the house I felt like something was not right. Just to be sure, I looked around and everything was normal. I was lying in my bed and I heard footsteps coming toward my room. It sounded like it stopped right at the top of the stairs. I figured it was just my mom making sure I was home and I rolled over and attempted to go to sleep.

Then, I heard heavy footsteps coming down my stairs. It turned over to look, but nothing was there. I got spooked, but after a while nothing happened so I tired to go to bed. After a few minutes, I heard something walking toward me, it stepped on a few pieces of paper. I looked over, and the paper was moving like someone had stepped on it and then stepped off only nobody was there. I had my heater on, but at that moment, it got very cold, and all of sudden I was very sleepy. I lied down in my bed, and right when I was about to go to sleep, I felt something pressing on my throat. At that moment, I got up. But I would want to go back asleep. The same thing would happen each time I was just about to go to sleep, but each time it would get more and more intense.

When it started getting too intense, my body involuntarily started flailing around, like it was struggling. As my body was struggling, it felt like something was trying to hold me down. Each time it would stop, I would start to get sleepy and fall back onto my bed, but my body would start moving around like it was not only fighting the sleep, but fighting what was holding me down. At first, I had no control over my body. It felt more like I was on a roller coaster and my body was the machine. It felt like I was just going along with it. When I thought of that, I tried to scream, but my screams came out muffled. I tried to get up and run away, but I would get pushed back down. I tried to grab my phone, but my phone got thrown across the room by whatever force was keeping me from getting help.

At one point, the force got very powerful out of nowhere. I remember seeing my arm in front of me while I was sitting up, and that was the last thing I saw. I was moving, I felt my head moving, I felt my body moving, but the only thing I could see was that moment where my hand was in front of me while I was sitting up. The next thing I saw was my ceiling. After a few moments I realized that I was lying half off the bed. I felt myself convulsing and I could not move. The next thing I remember was waking up a few hours later and going to work. I was back in my bed the way I usually sleep, and I could remember what had happened. Just to make sure it wasn't a dream, I looked next to me for my phone (where I always keep it no matter what), but it was across the room.

I don't know what happened. Ever since, I've slept in my house only three times. I will only go into the basement if I really need to, or if somebody is with me. When I told this story to a friend, he got scared and said that he thinks I got possessed. Everyone else thought I was crazy.

Sex with a Ghost,"New Jersey, United States",Succubus / Incubus / Sexual Ghosts,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Succubus / Incubus / Sexual Ghosts :: Sex with a Ghost

M y boyfriend and I have been going out for maybe 2 years now. We haven't had sexual intercourse in awhile. But, just the other night, something strange happened. We moved into a new apartment a couple of days ago. A young man use to live there but he passed away fro drug overdose. He died maybe 5-6 years ago. I was in the apartment doing things and my boyfriend called saying that he had a surprise for me when he got home from work. I didn't know what he was talking about but then it came to me that we might do something tonight.

So I got ready and was in the bedroom and turned the lights off and waited. I was in the bed, getting a little tired. I closed my eyes a bit and then started falling asleep. Then I heard the floor creak and something sitting right next to me on the bed. I asked ""Is that you John?"" I got no answer but then I felt a hand on my hip and a sexual arousal. I felt something touch me and then grab me. It felt so good I'll tell you that. But, it didn't feel like John. I still went along with it on account I haven't been in bed with him in awhile. I started to moan and the bed was shaking. Then it was over and I fell asleep.

When I awoke the next morning I saw John sleeping right next to me. I got up and started the day as usual. Then John came into the kitchen. I said to him ""Thanks for the surprise last night..."" He looked at me confused and said ""I didn't get to show you the surprise. When I came into the bedroom you were fast asleep..."" I was shocked! But, if that wasn't John, who was it?

I did some research on the man that used to be living in this apartment. Neighbors told me that girls would come into the apartment with him and then leave in the morning happy.

I don't know what to believe... It never did happen again after that night. Was it the man? Can someone explain why he did that to me?

The Touch,"District of Columbia, United States",Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: The Touch

I 've written before about how I believe my condo is haunted . The ghost likes to turn water on, turn off and on lights, and in general do things that are never really scary but seem to be a way to say ""Hey, I'm here too..."" There have been a couple of incidents lately that have been unusual that I thought I would share.

My husband was playing a video game on line with a friend and, as usual, they were up really late. I was reading in bed with the overhead bedroom light on - still up around 3 am. I got up to go to the bathroom and I turned on the hall light in our bedroom on my way in. When I got back in bed I noticed I had turned off the bathroom light but left the hall light on. I was displeased with myself but I was so comfy in bed reading my book and snuggling with the cats I couldn't really force myself to get up and turn it off. I justified leaving it on by commenting to the cats that my husband may appreciate having the light on if he came in to use the bathroom (I talk to the cats a lot).

About 5 minutes later the hall light turned off all by itself and our bedroom light which is on a dimmer dimmed to 50%. I actually heard the hall light switch click. This was unusual in that I was actually in the line of sight of the light switch and heard it click.

The ghost has started a new behavior. I now often find the doors to our foyer closet and the laundry room open. The first night it happened we came home from going out to dinner and found those doors open. Puzzled, since we were sure we left them closed, we just wrote it off as forgetfulness. Later that evening We were watching a video and stopped it about 1/2 way through to get some snacks and we found the doors open again. This time we knew that we had left them closed and we shrugged it off as the ghost and once again closed the doors. At the end of the video, when we were on our way to bed, we found the doors wide open again. When I say wide open I mean they were extended as far as they would go. I know none of us (including the cats) had left the living room after our snack break but to be sure I have done a series of experiments with the cats. Even to get something they really want that is inside the laundry room or the closet they cannot open either door by pawing under it. Now this game of opening the doors is happening a couple of times a week. It actually makes me laugh a little when I find them open which I think is just encouraging him/her but it just seems so ""in your face"" that I can't help it.

The most unusual incident is the one attempt at physical contact that occurred two weeks ago. My husband was on a business trip and he is in the habit of calling me every night just before he goes to bed. I was reading in bed, waiting for his call, and was laying on my side. I suddenly felt a cool, hair ruffling breeze near my head and a tap, tap on my shoulder. I immediately turned over to look behind me but there was no one there. This was a very solid feeling tap, tap. Not hard or hurtful but just the sort of thing you would do to get someone's attention. The hair all over my body stood up on end. My first impulse was to run out into the condo hallway and bang on a friend's door! I fought very hard with myself not to panic or be visibly scared. I finally said out loud: I know you're here and I am pretty sure that you didn't mean to scare me but you did. Please don't do anything like that unless you have an urgent reason to get my attention. So far nothing like this has happened again.

I continue to ask the ghost if it needs help in any way but do not get any direct reply. Every once in a while I swear I hear my name being called when I am the only one here but when I reply I hear nothing else. This lead to one amusing incident when my sister-in-law heard my name come out of a turned off radio. I heard it too but I am so used to hearing - or at least thinking I hear - my name called that I just ignored it and didn't comment on it. She was floored that I was hearing voices so often that I just ignored them coming out of turned off appliances :-)

I also continue to gently encourage the ghost to move on to the next step of its journey but so far it seems to be content to stick around.

The Ouija Board and John,"Ohio, United States",Ouija Board / Seances,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Ouija Board / Seances :: The Ouija Board and John

I 'm 27, and I live in a small city in Ohio. When I was 16, I met this chic named Becca, we got along good, and to this day she's my best friend. The same day we met, I found out that she lived in a house that I was way too familiar with. Another best friend of mine (Mo) had live there a few years before, and my uncle dated her mom (Francis) so I stayed with them regularly. (you'll want to remember this)

It wasn't very long after I met Becca that I was practically living with her and her family, which consisted of her, her younger sister Nikki and her father. Her mom passed away years before I met them. I loved staying with them because her dad worked a 12 hour night shift at our towns local steel mill, and he was pretty naive to what young girls left home alone at night could (and would get into). But it was awesome. We always had sleep overs with a few of our other closest friends, and at that age we were ""experimenting"" new things with smoking pot being one of our favorite trials. We really liked to play our music loudly, and dance and laugh and have a good time.

One of our biggest joys was prank calling the hottest boys in school, and other girls that we just didn't like. I'll put it this way whatever we did we had a good time.

Well one night I will never forget, it was in June of '06, it was on a Friday, and it was storming outside. It was close to midnight. There was myself, Becca, Kristen, Angel, and another girl named Angie. We were all in Becca's room having a good time. Nikki (Becca's younger sister) was in their dads' room asleep. We had just finished smoking and we were all higher then we should of been, and Angie says ""hey look what I brought"", and she pulled an Ouija board out of her bag. All the girls were excited and ready to play. I on the other hand was very skeptical. I was afraid of what they were going to bring to the surface. But they talked me into it, and I wish they hadn't.

We lit candles and turned the lights out. The windows in the bed room were open because it was so smokey. It got very quiet all you could hear was the rain, and the thunder crackling from out side. So we all sat there with our two little fingers on the small plastic piece and one of the girls asked if there were any spirits present. We all watched for a couple minutes with anticipation. Nothing! Again ""if there are any spirits here let yourself be known"" Or something along those lines. We were all concentrating so deeply on this board, and then out of no where Nikki (from the other room) screamed and ran into our room crying. She was literally shaking, saying there was a man standing over her in the other room and that she thought that he had walked into the closet.

All of a sudden there was a loud crash of thunder that scared the mess outta all of us. We turned the lights on quickly, and cautiously walked towards the other room. One of us with a baseball bat, one with a Bataan, and Becca had grabbed a big knife out of the kitchen. There was light shinning out of the room from the TV playing but the rest of the room was dark. Becky reached her hand inside and flipped the light on and gave the door a push so we could see inside.

Kristen was on the phone with her mom. They only stayed about 2 or 3 minutes away, and her mom said she'd be right there. So with all 6 of us inside her dads room we were still scared to open the closet. A minute later the door bell rang and kind of gave us all a chill. But it was Kristen's mom we told her what happened minus the Ouija board. She opened the closet door and one of our cats jumped out. It made Kristen's mom scream a little. We all got a good laugh out of that.

But no one knew how buttons (our cat) had gotten in there. Kris's mom checked around the rest of the house, including the basement every thing was OK so she left us there and told us to call her back if we needed to. Well needless to say Nik ended up staying in our room the rest of the night and when she was able to fall asleep I decided to tell the girls what I knew, and this is it: After my uncle and Francis (Mo's mom) broke up I wasn't allowed to stay there very often because my mom was told that Francis had started using hard core drugs and that she was partying a lot.

Francis started seeing a new man name John who I had met a few times. He seemed like a nice guy he'd take us back and forth to the rollerena and things like that. But Mo had told us of her mom and John fighting a lot.! Well the last night that I stayed in that house before I met Becca was one of the craziest nights of my life. Me, and 2 other girls Laura, and Amanda were sleeping over at Mo's. We were in her room which is the same room that was now Becca's. We were listening to music, and stuffing our faces with the normal sleep over junk food, and just enjoying ourselves when Francis and John Started arguing.

First they were in the living room and we heard her say ""where's it"" at John, and he said there isn't any then they went into their room (which was now Becca's dads room). A few minutes had passed where we could hear them shouting back and fourth and it had sounded like a glass had been busted on the other side of the wall. Mo went to knock on her moms door. She was worried that her mom was getting beat up. All of a sudden we heard a loud bang and heard Francis screaming Johns name. Mo opened the door and Francis started screaming at her to get out. Mo saw a portion of John lying on the bed and blood all over. Francis was screaming for all of us to get out of the house. She said get help! We were scared we didn't know what happened.

We all ran next door to Mo's grandmas house where her younger brother and sister were staying for the night. Mo started telling her grandma what was going on and to call for the police. Francis within one minute or so ran over crying and had blood all over her. She was screaming to call the police she said ""John, John he's dead!"" We all started flipping out! Crying and shiat! He had killed himself! Shot himself right in the head!

The police came and investigated and interviewed all of us. All of our parents had to come for us to be released to them. I was only 12 when this happened. I will never forget that night!

After that Mo's mom had to go to rehab, and she spent several months in a psychiatric hospital in PA. Mo and her brother and sister moved away with their grandma. When all this stuff happened with the Ouija board I knew in my heart that the man that nik seen was John. I could feel it in my soul.

When I finished telling everyone my story Angel started to cry as she grabbed onto my arm, she pointed to a window in the room, (where the porch was) and there was a shadow standing there like it was watching or listening, all of us started scooting on our butts with our backs toward the bedroom door keeping our eyes focused on the window. I said thanks for watching out for us John but you can go now your scaring us, and without the shadow moving in any direction, it just disappeared! It was gone and we all still tell this story to this day!

I think if he had not showed his shadow to us there on the porch right at that time, that my friends would not have believed me. Only because it was such a traumatic experience. Before I moved in with Becca and her family when I first told my mom where she lived my mom told me that if I went there that I was going to see him again! She also told me to tell them what had happened there in that house. I still have trouble talking about it. I wanted to tell them and I thought about it often I just could not bring my self to say it!

I have not seen Monica for many years now, and I see the other girls who were there that night very seldom. But when we do run into each other, there's a silence that we all know well. The first time I saw Laura after I had this experience with Johns ghost, I had to explain to her in detail what had happened that night and there was such a heaviness in the air and we were both chilled to the bone with goose bumps.

Shadow People Back in my Life,"Michigan, United States",Old Hags / Night Attacks / Sleep Paralysis,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Old Hags / Night Attacks / Sleep Paralysis :: Shadow People Back in my Life

I am terrified lately. A white van has been waiting outside of my house the past couple of weeks when I'm prompted -- for whatever reason -- to wake up at 3 a.m. It just sits there blocking my driveway and then immediately driving off when I notice it. I thought it was a person at first, but then I started having terrible nightmares -- I'm talking ones that leave me in sobbing tears when I wake up -- during the past few nights.

The most recent was a hooded man standing outside my window looking inside. He has no face, because he is a shadow figure. I asked him in the dream who he was. ""No one,"" he said. I can feel these shadow people around me. I haven't encountered them since I was a child, and I've been reading about people's experiences with these shadow people on here, and mine is similar.

When I was a child I woke up one night to the sound of what looked like a shadow child flipping my light switch on and off (it was turned off from the ceiling, because my fan was on; it was summer). It said, ""Get out now before it's worse on you..."" I tried to scream but my voice was frozen, and I got out a yelp and eventually a crying scream. I also heard the whispers, and experienced the feeling of being choked. I was a kid, though. It didn't last long, but now I feel like they are back in my life.

I don't know what to do. Why would they leave for so long and then come back? What do they want? Someone please give me some answers.

My Son and my Mom's Grave,"New Jersey, United States",Family / Friends Visits,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Family / Friends Visits :: My Son and my Mom's Grave

M y son decided to visit my mom's grave a few years back but wasn't sure exactly where it was in the cemetery. My son always blamed himself for her death because a few days after an argument with her she had one of her heart attacks, she died a month later. It was Christmas eve 1983.

I tried to explain to him that she was only given 5 years to live if she didn't have open heart surgery and she didn't want it. And the 5 years were up at this point so she was living on borrowed time. Mom had a way of saying things like ""if you don't quit that, you are going to give me a heart attack"" or ""are you trying to kill me?"" so of course, my son remember one of her comments and so he was sure the petty argument was the cause of her death. My mom accused me of killing my father (of a broken heart) because I married so young (16/17) and had a child. So it was part of her personality to place guilt on us kids.

Her death, ruined many Christmas' because it brought back memories for all of us, it was hard to celebrate a happy occasion mixed with a sad one. My son's ex-wife told me it was a big cause in the break up their marriage. So being I lived in Florida and he in NJ, I decided to write him a long letter explaining the facts of her death and why my mom would say such things.

I guess it helped him because he started getting over his guilt and come Christmas he had a good time.

Well as I stated, he decided to go to the cemetery to visit her grave. He kind of knew where the plot was but not really sure where to look. He started to ""talk"" to my mom asking where she was and all of the sudden music came blaring out of a window of a house across the street from the cemetery. The song was one of his favorites, a heavy metal song about dying (not stairway to heaven) but I can't remember the name. He walked towards the music and when it stopped, he looked down and there was my family plot. No other music came out of that window the remainder of the time he was there.

He stayed a long time and made peace with her as well as visiting my father's grave and other family members he never met.

The cemetery is in the middle of a neighborhood surrounded by homes on all 4 sides so it wasn't unusual to hear outside noises or see people in the area. It just seemed strange that on this day a song from my son's past regarding death and dying was playing loudly out a window, and quit just as he got to the right plot.

A Dark Relationship,"California, United States",Misc,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Misc :: A Dark Relationship

I 'm sure some of you have read a few of my stories involving my many ghostly experiences. Well this one is a bit different. It was 2003, just getting out of high school, I started dating this guy Ronnie. I liked everything about him. He was in a band, very popular, just had that ""thing"". But there was one thing I couldn't stand about him. I'm a Catholic and very big in my Faith, and every time I would drive he would ask me why I drive with a Bible in my car. Then start asking me all these questions regarding my Religion.

Some like, ""Well, when you're in trouble, where's God""? Or if there's a God, then why does this or that happen. He told me that he doesn't believe there is a God, and that he believes when you die, that you are six feet under and that's all. I really liked him so I had to respect his opinion. But as time passed, I couldn't take his nitpicking on my religion anymore. He was always treating me bad, using drugs, overall I was just in a crappy, ugly and dark relationship. I felt like he was trying to get me to stop believing in God.

While in that relationship (if you even want to call it that) I felt dark and depressed. A weird thing that still scares me to this day when I think about it is that there were always these ugly huge brown spiders hanging around my door ways and windows to my house. It seems that they were only there while I was in this relationship. After going through some depression I decided that I couldn't take it anymore. So we broke up.

The first thing I did before I went to sleep was grab my bible and I just started praying, more than I ever have before. While I was praying I started to feel a very evil presence around me, very heavy feeling like there was something evil surrounding me and I heard, not aloud but telepathically (in my head) something telling me to stop praying.

That scared the crap out of me. But all I could do was just pray even harder. After about a few minutes, that ""feeling"" was gone.

I didn't know what had happened. Was I possessed? I don't think so. I just think that once I started getting my Faith and religion back that the ""Devil"" or his people tried everything they could to try and stop me from praying. But it didn't work. Thank God. And as the days went on and I kept on praying, all those ugly, nasty spiders started going away. I never saw them again!

I still think about those ugly times, thanking God that I had strength to keep my head and faith up. And not to let any evil or darkness get to me. Its still scary to think about it. I wonder what it exactly was.

Was it the devil? What about those creepy spiders? Still gives me the chills. If anyone can help a friend in need, let me know. Thank you for taking the time to read my story.

A Blue Light,Canada,Orbs / Lights / Mists,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Orbs / Lights / Mists :: A Blue Light

I have had many weird things happen to me in my life. This one happened only last Friday. I went to bed around 1 am after watching a movie on tv. I noticed it had started to snow. I wasn't heavy snow but wet and melted as it touched the ground. I woke up in the middle of the night because I felt cold. I glanced at the bedside clock but it was off. It was really dark in the room and I noticed that even my night light in the ensuite was off.

I got up to check outside and by that time there was quite a bit of snow. All the electricity was off in our house and in the neighborhood. No street lights either. With the snow it was bright enough to see my way around in the dark. I went back to bed and I was lying there thinking how strange it must be if we had no electricity as we relied on it so much and also wondered how long it has been off as it was getting chilly.

I was lying there when I noticed that there was a strange brightness, a bluish light of some kind coming from the hallway. There is nothing at that end of the hallway but a mirror at the end. As I watched it, it got brighter and then slowly dimmed and disappeared. I thought maybe it was a reflection from across the street at the neighbors as his driveway was facing our window. I went downstairs to check and the truck was still sitting in his driveway with the headlights facing towards the garage door. Also the window had wood shutter blinds and they were closed. If there was a light from his truck it would be red because of the taillights.

I have no explanation as to what the source of the light was. It seemed to come out of the end of the hallway and looked similar to the kind of light when a tv is on in another room and the house is dark. But my husband was sleeping, my younger son slept in the basement bedroom and the older one was staying over at a friend's house.

I have never seen a light like that before and wonder if anyone else had seen something similar or maybe can give me an explanation. From what my neighbor told me the lights were out for about two hours and came back on about 4:30 or so. Except for the light in my bedroom from outside there was absolutely no way any light could reach the hallway. It seemed like it was only a few seconds, starting out as weak and got really bright and faded. My husband thought maybe it was from the smoke alarm (?) but it is connected to the electrical power and has no backup battery. Why would a smoke alarm shine anyways?

I am not sure if it was electrical as there was no electricity so his explanation makes no sense. I did have another weird experience involving lights about a month ago. It was late in the evening and I was working late on my computer. The stupid thing started acting really weird as if it had a life of its own, opening and closing programs etc. I checked the program I use to see if anyone was trying to hack in or something and everything was ok.

Then the lights in the office started flickering. I thought maybe because it was a bit windy outside and caused problems with power or something. As I was thinking that, the lights started to dim and brighten. It did this three times! I don't have a dimmer switch and the bulb is a neon bulb. It was as if someone was trying to get my attention or something, but there was no one in the room and I could see the wall switch from where I was sitting. I went down to the basement where my son was watching tv and asked him if the lights were flickering or anything. He said no. Apparently it was only in my office. I have never heard of a power surge in one room only.

We have lived in this house for 16 years. We are the second owners and as far as I know no one died here as it is only about 27 years old. But from day one I have had weird stuff happen, both to myself and to my children. Hubby naturally blames everything on the wind. Inside the house with all the windows closed in the dead of winter?

The blue light was like when someone opens a door at the end of the hallway and the light shines then when they close the door it fades. No door, only a large mirror and the length of that hall from my bedroom door is only about 5 feet to the wall.

The Broken Lamp,Canada,Poltergeists / Physical Manifestations,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Poltergeists / Physical Manifestations :: The Broken Lamp

T his happened in 2005. I was in bed reading when I heard a crash and glass breaking. I thought something had fallen in the sink so I went down and checked the kitchen. Everything was neat and tidy and nothing was out of place. I returned to bed but kept thinking about the noise I heard. It was definitely glass breaking. So I got up again and went to check the kids, who were all sleeping. I went downstairs to the family room and turned on the lights. There was broken glass all over the hardwood floor. Also on the floor was a six inch taper candle broken in half.

The glass and the candle were part of a hurricane lamp I received from a friend as a gift. I had placed it on the top of the tv wall unit way in the back so no one could knock it off accidentally. In the front of the lamp was a large potted plant. In front of the plant was a row of bowling trophies hubby won. Now the lamp itself is solid brass holder and really heavy, with a glass cover. The candle was brand new and was never burned but more for a decoration.

ONLY the glass and the candle itself was on the floor! The heavy brass holder was still there sitting way in the back BEHIND all the other stuff. Nothing was knocked over. Looking at the candle, it was broken in the middle and melted where the break was. You could see that the wick was still unburned only the outside was melted in one spot near the break. The glass was in many pieces on the floor as if it was literally smashed to the ground with force.

By that time the whole house was awake. No one had any idea how the glass and the candle could land on the floor with all the obstacles in front and not knock over something if it fell. It definitely did NOT fall as everything was in its place including the actually holder.

Hubby thought it was probably a mouse. Unless it was HUGE and was on steroids or something to grab and lift the 8 inch tall glass AND candle and fling it OVER all the stuff then I need an exterminator!

The usual 'wind' theory hubby has was full of hot air. No wind in a downstairs family room with windows all closed and frozen shut in some of the other rooms as it was about -30C outside!

Everyone else heard the crash, but none of us have an explanation. As I was still wide awake and reading I would have noticed someone going downstairs as they had to pass by my room and the door was open. Was it a poltergeist? No idea.

A similar experience happened recently about a year ago. The girls are both married and moved out only the boys live at home as they are going to college (cant afford to move out yet) and they are in their mid 20's. They were downstairs in the basement entertaining some friends. As they were sitting there talking, the soccer ball on the shelf came FLOATING down and land with a plop on the floor. NO bounce. It was as if someone invisible took it off the shelf and placed it on the floor. All of them saw it and for grown young men they were 'freaked out' as they put it. If a soccer ball falls for whatever reason it usually bounces. It doesn't SLOWLY float off the shelf and land on the floor with no bounce.

We are second owners. This house is less than 30 years old and the original owners were a young couple with small children. This was the first time anyone had actually SEEN something move on its own.

My husband is the biggest skeptic. Even if he SEES something with his own eyes he tries to explain it away as nothing or his favorite the 'wind'. We have had stuff like footprints outside the house appearing from nowhere in the middle of the yard (noticed by the neighbor kid) and stopping and disappearing as if whoever walked flew away, banging on the bathroom door and you open it and no one is there and you are alone in the house, noises of drawers opening and closing and the latches making a tinkling noise (dressers all have pull handles) hearing voices upstairs when you are downstairs or downstairs when you go up and you are alone. Strange lights, and weird electrical problems like the blender turning on in the middle of the night by itself and it was unplugged! The tv turning on and off by itself or changing channels on its own just to name a few.

If this place is haunted then who is haunting it? No one died here and the neighbors new the previous original owners. I would love to hear from anyone who had similar experiences or even a logical explanation (other than wind or mice).

My Hauntings,"Texas, United States",Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: My Hauntings

I 've mentioned before that I've always felt like I was haunted . I don't understand it nor do I want to, I've been doing fine without knowing for 25 years. Before I begin I will tell you more about myself. I believe in everything, I believe that there are lost souls who wander this earth, I believe that the devil can sway your thoughts, I believe that there are a few number of people who can tell you of your past, present and future with just a look. Growing up I was always obsessed with the paranormal, I'd read anything about the subject.

I am going to share a few incidents that have happened to me, and to this day I still can't figure it out. (My fiancé is the nephew of my dad's girlfriend, and at one point we both lived with them for about 6 months)

1. My fiancé was packing (he sometimes had to go to different cities in Texas to work) and we were at my dad's girlfriends house. History about the house was that two brothers owned the house and there was a murder-suicide and now the house is somewhat haunted. Well he was on the couch going through his things and I was on the love seat with his cousin, who was 13 at the time. I was painting her toenails and so the way that we were seated on the couch, I was on the actual part of the couch and she was seating on the arm, facing me.

We were all talking and all of a sudden you could see this black form floating down the hall. It looked as if it was on the wall, but either way we all saw it. My fiancé said ""oh that's just a shadow of a rat"", but there was no way that it could have been a rat. His cousin and I were kind of shocked; she told me that when she was little that she would always see this man, but as she got older she stopped seeing him. She said that she never saw anything like that before and it kind of scared her. The form was not a human shape, more of a blob.

We all kind of sat there and I told my fiancé to go see where it went if it was just a rat, needless to say he didn't want to check.

2. Another incident happened at the same house, my dad and his girlfriend were at a benefit for someone who died, all four of her kids were home, 3 were in their bedroom playing video games and another was in the shower. My fiancé had been out of town, and since it was just us there my dad locked the house up, burglar bars, the main gate outside.

From my dad's room I could see who came in and out of the boys' bedroom, the littlest one who's 6, left the room and came running back saying ""Jenny, James is home but he won't talk to me, he's standing at the door, but he won't talk to me"". I knew that there was no way that anyone could come in, so I asked him to show me where he was and I followed him into the living room and he pointed right to the sliding door area (known to be where a man was killed, also where the grandfather had died).

I asked him to show me what ""James"" was doing and he stood with his back turned, hands on his hips and started laughing. I asked him why he was laughing and he said ""that's what 'James' was doing"", I told him that there was no one there, but he was insistent about him being there, he kept asking me ""why was he laughing at me, why didn't 'James' want to look at me?"" I couldn't answer that and it's crazy because he said that man looked like my fiancé from the back.

I told my dad's girlfriend about what happened and she told me that all of her kids have seen this ""man"" but soon forget when they reach about 12 years old. She told me that she never seen the man, only a small child, which is what the next incident is about.

3. Late one night my fiance and I were watching TV, my dad and his girlfriend were at a party, 2 out of the 4 kids were away at sleepovers. The only ones there that night were me, my fiance, the 6 year old and the 8 year old. It was about 1:30 am, and suddenly this little boy appeared in the hallway, he was very pale, dark hair, big brown eyes, he had on those blue fleece pajamas with the footies. I asked him ""Baby, what's the matter?"" thinking it was the 6 year old, my fiance looked over and asked me who was I talking to? ""Stevie (not his real name) was there"", and out of nowhere he was gone, my fiance got up to check to see what was going on because there was no way that ""Stevie"" could have gotten off the bunk bed by himself, he calls for someone to get him when he wants to get off.

My fiance came back and told me that they were both asleep, that somehow it was a reflection from the TV. I doubt that, but I know what I saw, and for a brief second I saw that little boy.

There are a lot other stories that have been told to me about that house, but I don't feel it's my right to share those stories, I do however have some more stories regarding the trailer, so I will try and post some more as soon as I find the time!

Old Hobby Shop Ghost,"Hawaii, United States",Apparitions / Voices / Touches,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Apparitions / Voices / Touches :: Old Hobby Shop Ghost

I 'm in the military stationed on the NCTAMS PAC Communications base in Wahiawa Hawaii. I work for base police and one morning at about 0540 the base was completely quiet and pitch black. I decided to park over by the old hobby shop facing the base Fire Department.

I was parked just hanging out listening to the radio when I saw the image of an older asian man walking around the grass area by the hobby shop. I didn't think anything was unusual; maybe the employee's arrived early that day. Then about five minutes later I saw the old man again and I was going to make contact with him but when I took out my flashlight to walk towards him he was gone!

I was a little shook up when I got back into my vehicle then my police unit suddenly shut off, but the key didn't turn back! I had no idea what to think I was stunned then my unit started to rock back and forth like if someone was jumping on my bumper, I got out and had my pistol ready but there was no one there. Just then my car turned back on by itself.

I was scared to death and rushed back to the police station with my emergency lights on. When I got there I explained to my supervisor what had happened, from now on I don't leave the station until after the sun comes up.

I've been a Military Police Officer for 6 years and have seen and dealt with a lot of bad situations, but nothing ever scared me like this.

Held Down by a Strange Force,Canada,Old Hags / Night Attacks / Sleep Paralysis,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Old Hags / Night Attacks / Sleep Paralysis :: Held Down by a Strange Force

T his past summer of 07 something really strange happened to me. I went to bed at the same time as I usually do which was probably 12 am - 1 am and I fell asleep. As I was asleep, I woke up to feeling very awkward. When I woke up I noticed that there was a huge black circle over my bed. Being scared I tried to get out of bed to run to my parents room or something but it felt like I was being held down by something. It's really hard to describe but it didn't just feel as if it was a person holding me down. It felt as if it were a force of some kind.

As I laid there scared sh*tless because the only thing I could move were my eyes and I could move my feet a little bit. I looked around and saw that there was a weird black figure. Sort of looked like a person who would have a black cloak on but they were really blurry. Again. Its really hard to explain, as I laid there looking around the room thinking I'm going to die my dog was also in my room with me laying on my bed looking straight at me.

And finally she stood up and came up to my face and licked me and that's when I sort of was able to snap out of it and I was able to move again. I then ran to my mothers room and woke her up and told her about it. (I was 19 and I don't get scared very easily).

The next day after it took me a while to fall back asleep I kept thinking to my self. ""I'm a really vivid dreamer. Maybe I was just dreaming. And maybe coincidentally everything in my room was in the exact same place and nothing was missing"" So. I started to think that it was just a dream. And it didn't help much that my mom was saying it was just a dream also.

A few months later I ended up moving to Halifax, NS into my own apartment by myself. A couple weeks after I moved in the same exact thing happened to me. Except this time there was no black circle it was just the weird black blurry figures except this time there was more then just one. There was probably a few of them. And one was right beside me on my bed.

When I was finally able to snap out of it. I looked around my room and everything was the exact same as what it was when I was being held down by those forces. So that's when I decided that there was no way that I could of had 2 dreams the exact same and both of them having nothing missing out of my rooms or anything that was not in the right place. Like for example my guitar was in the exact same spot.

A couple weeks ago I was staying in a hotel in Toronto, Ontario and the same thing happened to me. I started to fall asleep and then got woken up to a strange feeling of being held down. Except this time there was quit a bit of black blurry figures all around me. A lot more then the first and second time. And this time there still was no black circle above my bed on my ceiling (so I really don't know what was up with that in the first time).

I kept trying to move desperately and still couldn't and also I forgot to mention. While I'm being held down I can't scream or talk at all it seems like I was striped of my voice and everything. And again everything was also the same. I had a half opened laptop laying on the bed beside me and everything in the room was the same. Which I don't see how I could remember everything in my room if it was actually a dream. Which I KNOW for a fact it wasn't.

Also this other time that I was in a hotel I was just laying on my bed watching a movie on my laptop and I had a spoon flat on my desk and all of a sudden it just fell off. (I don't know if a ghost had anything to do with it. Also there was no base from the movie I was watching so there's no way that it could of caused the spoon to fall down)

Yesterday while I was at work I was talking with one of my co-workers who's a flight attendant, she used to read tarot cards and has experienced ghost encounters herself, also her mother is a palm reader and she has a lot of visions. So there's some kind of psychic stuff that goes on with their family.

I told her about what was happening to me and she asked me if I had done anything to try to contact spirits before or anything like that. And I got to thinking. I bought a ouija board the summer of 06. But I never tried to use it until the summer of 07 with some friends, we were able to talk to a spirit but I always thought that it was just my friend pulling a joke on me even though he swore it wasn't him. When I told her about that she told me that I should get rid of the board asap.

Till this day this still scares the sh*t out of me when ever it happens. If anyone has any suggestions or same past experiences or comments let me know :) thx.

Ghost in my Old House,Canada,Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: Ghost in my Old House

M y experiences started approximately 4 years ago. I had just bought my house which was built in 1954, so it is a little bit older, no big deal right? I was just happy to be an owner of a house at such a young age. Before moving in we started upgrading a bit, small things like paint, electrical sockets etc. And while working later at night you would hear some strange noises. I did not think much of it because the house is older. Me and my friend moved in a few weeks later and noticed odd things starting to happen.

Everything was pretty normal at the beginning nothing exciting. I should note that to get to the basement there was a door which lead to the landing where the backdoor was, and then you would turn the corner to get to the undeveloped basement. My friend decided to put his bed downstairs where it would be dark and quiet.

After a while he started saying how he would wake up to some really strange noises, things he could not quite put his finger on what it could be. He would tell me about it and I would just chalk it up to an old house.

Well a few weeks later he decided to move upstairs and was more than a little freaked about the basement. Now I am a believer of the supernatural but I know the mind can play tricks on you if you let it, well the stuff that started happening I for one cannot explain at all.

My friend and my dog were home by themselves and were in the kitchen, when in the bathroom 15 feet away the faucet turns on and my dog high tails it out of there through her dog door, and my friend left.

Once I was sitting home alone with my dog upstairs, and clear as a bell, no old house creaks or bangs but like someone directly below me had a broom and hit the floor right beneath my feet. Again my dog is outta there.

Another odd experience happened in the kitchen, which when my bedroom door is open overlooks. I woke up one morning, not groggy or anything and I saw someone sitting in a chair, I turn my head for one second and ask what are you doing thinking its my roommate and when I turn back it is gone.

Also at night we kept the dog locked in the landing by the stairs to the basement and for 3 nights in a row she would wake me up at 6 am exactly to the minute whining and crying and freaking out, so now she sleeps in my room.

My roommate found out from the neighbor that not the people before us but the people that lived there before them, the old man died in my basement. Now I am not sure if I can chalk this all up to coincidence but I would sure like to know what, if anything is in my old house.

It Followed Me from Home,Norway,Misc,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Misc :: It Followed Me from Home

W hen I was 13-14 years old, after school one day, my friend Lisa asked me if I wanted to come over to her place later to maybe watch a movie and eat some candy, since her parents and siblings are going to visit her aunt, so I said sure I think I can.

Later that day no one could drive me down to her so I had to walk (Lucky it was summer, so I wasn't freezing to death), but as I was halfway towards her place (She's around 3-4 kilometers away) I noticed something was following me so I quickly turned around and no one was there. I just thought it was my imagination so I kept on walking.

As I came to her house I still felt something was looking right at me from behind, but I tried to ignore it as the best I could. I ringed their door bell and her mother came out and I went inside to her room.

We just sat there talking about normal stuff and after, we went to the store to buy some candy for when her parents leave. But as we walked, she kept turning her head around and she kept doing it a couple of times. ""What is it?"" I asked her, and she just replied ""Oh nothing, I just felt like someone was watching us"" I didn't reply and thought it might just be a bird or something watching us.

As it became dark and her parents left, we put on Star Wars (Can't remember which one) and we ate candy while watching. Suddenly we heard something downstairs, like some boxes were moved so we went downstairs and checked, but nothing was to be found so we went back up and kept on watching again.

Then it came again and we were really frightened, ""Let's just turn the T.V off and go to my room instead"" she said and we took the candy and put the movie on pause.

When we had just walked 3 steps the movie suddenly started again and the T.V went on. She screamed and jumped, and she quickly turned off the DVD player, and the T.V and we ran into her room and closed the door.

We jumped into her bed and put her blanket over our laps. ""What just happened?!"", I just replied ""I have no idea..."" then we heard the boxes were moving again for a few seconds, we heard something that started to walk up their stairs. We were really scared and were frozen in terror, but as the steps reached the top of the stairs they stopped, and she quickly grabbed her cell phone to call her mom, but as fast as she got it up we heard their house phone started to ring and we hid under the blanket.

It rang for almost 30 seconds before it stopped and then we heard the steps again, and they went to her bedroom door (The room we were in) and then it stopped again.

We were just sitting there in terror, until we heard her parent's car come up in their driveway. We were really happy and we heard them come up the stairs (Even before they went out of the car) and we heard nail scratching on the walls all the way to her bedroom door, and suddenly it opened quickly and Lisa screamed again, but it was her parents this time.

""Ha ha, what were you doing in the bed? Weren't you going to watch a movie?""

Lisa got angry and said ""No! Weren't not a couple, and we were hiding from the strange thing in the house""

But she couldn't explain it and the parents thought we were just imaging it, so after we were so confused and I was so scared what it might have been.

My Personal Ghost,"Indiana, United States",A Haunted Life,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: A Haunted Life :: My Personal Ghost

N orth Manchester-Haunted Houses  -At 104 East 2nd Street there is a big brick house that has apartments in it. We had the entire house as we had a big family. It was months before we discovered it had a second attic, behind a wall in the upstairs kitchen. It joined the upper attic by a passageway. I have seen at least two ghosts at this house and on frequent occasions.

The main apparition is a tall, gangly man, dressed either in period clothing from the 1800's or like the Peabody/Amish ghost. I often wonder if it is not the same being. At least five times that I recall I have seen him and my friends have had a show from him also. He will walk right past you and discount you as anything out of the ordinary. People near me have joked ""Maybe he thinks you are the ghost and he is afraid to look at you"".

Once, as a friend of mine and I were sitting outside of my house, a shadowy outline of him stood in the window upstairs. I said nothing. I asked my friend if he wanted to go uptown and he answered ""Yeah, as long as you don't say anything about that ghost in the window"", I said ""Oh, you saw that, huh?"". We had just left the house, we both knew there was nobody inside.

About a week later that friend and his sister and I were walking late at night. We were going towards their house when we saw that same ghost walking up the steps and on to the porch, heading for the door. We were right behind him going in their front door but there was nobody there when we got inside. We had told her about my ghost before and asked her ""Now do you believe?"". The answer was yes.

The second known apparition was that of a young, red headed boy that accompanied the other ghost coming down the outside basement steps. If you drive through the alley behind the house, it has those Amityville House kind of eyes. (I always say ""that's what you get for building houses with faces""). There were always the classic symptoms of a haunt there like doors shutting on you as you opened them.

The second house I lived at is at 207 West 4th Street. It appears to be the same gangly, Amish looking man I see here. You could not walk the upstairs hallway without shuddering, thinking something was just about to make itself known to you. Doors would open and shut, sometimes in your face as you tried to enter a room. Inanimate objects seemed to take life. Heavy footsteps are heard often from upstairs when nobody is there and in the living room when there is nobody in it. Pictures have fallen off of the walls and landed quite a distance from where they were hung.

I remember a time when a bunch of us were playing cards in the dining room. There came a noise above us that sounded like a soldier marching in his boots. My brother said ""Dang your kids are making an awful racket up there"" to which I replied ""Ummmm, there's nobody here but us"". Besides, the way the house is built we were under a flat spot that is the ceiling of the dining room and the slope in the roof. It was impossible for anyone to be walking there. There was an attic space but no access to it.

My sister swears the spirit of our mother lives on in the house. She said she woke up one night while visiting us and a picture of our mother seemed to float across the room and land beside her bed. She could not say she was 100% positive it happened like that, just waking from a sound sleep.

My daughter, when she was an infant, was playing on the floor between the front door and the stairway that leads upstairs. Her focus shifted from her toys to the front door and her head seemed to follow someone walking. She had to reposition herself to crane her neck to see someone behind her and her gaze followed around and all the way up the stairs, crouching to see around the landing and the turn. She stared for a brief second as if the person walked around the turn of the stairs and could no longer be seen and looked at me with a slightly puzzled look, pointed her finger up the stairs and said ""Mamaw"". My mother died four years before my daughter was born.

An ex girlfriend was in the kitchen and, looking pale as a ghost herself, hustled into the living room and told me she heard a voice in the kitchen. Once, the bathroom door refused to let her out. We left the house later and when we returned, one of the bushes grabbed onto her. In a semi panic she bolted through the front door. I had an old candy dish that was a turtle with a hinged shell and when you pressed the head, the shell opened. As she passed the turtle, it's shell opened up and after a few ""I rebuke thees"" she vowed never to step foot in that house again, and she didn't.

The ghost got into a stomping fit in my living room when I was on the phone with her and she asked, knowing the answer, ""is that him?"". She could hear it over the phone. Across the street, the neighbors house burned to the ground. Two houses down, another neighbors house befell the same fate. The wood working factory cattycorner from me went up like kindling. Less than one month after I moved out of the house it too, caught fire.

Weird Happenings at Home,Kuwait,Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: Weird Happenings at Home

T his my first story that I am writing so please bare with me the way I write. This is taking place in Kuwait. I shifted into a newly built flat (or apartment, you can say) so it had no past history or anything. I shifted about two years ago there.

Well, everything was calm and cool until a few months ago. About five months ago, I was alone at home. It was around 8:00 p.m. and I was watching T.V. Everything was silent. After a while, I went to my room and sat on my computer. After a while, I heard a splashing sound, like water flowing somewhere. I looked everywhere and finally came to the bathroom (we have two bathrooms beside each other. One is for me and my mom and the other for my brother and dad) The tap was on and the water was flowing. I got confused because a little while ago, everything was silent. The tap was the one which you have to pull up to on it. I just ignored it thinking I must have not heard before.

Then after a few weeks, again I was home alone. There was no wind outside and it was a peaceful and calm day. After a while, I heard knocking on our balcony window (We live on the 6th floor) but when I went and saw, nothing at all! Now it has all stopped. Sometimes I do hear knocks and stuff but then all of a sudden, it stops.

Is my house really haunted or is it my imagination? Please comment! I need your help people!

The Ghosts and my Kids,"Indiana, United States",Children Who See Spirits,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Children Who See Spirits :: The Ghosts and my Kids

I 'm going to start simple here. I don't really have specific dates or anything because this has been off and on for quite a while. Most of the experiences we've had have dealt with my kids. (Recent note: we've had to move back into my parents for financial reasons so that's where we are today and where all of this has happened) We never had anything happen until we had an ADT system installed and he went into the attic to install it.

This all started about 9 years ago or so. I was sitting in the living room with my oldest (at the time my only) son. My step dad had just went back to work that night after recovering from hernia surgery. I was on the phone talking to my brother in law (at the time just a very close friend) when all of a sudden my son starts quietly crying. More sniffling than actual sobbing or crying.

I asked him what was wrong and he looks over at me and says ""Pappaws gone and he's not coming home"". I told him pappaw was just at work and he'd be home in the morning. (he's a truck driver) He said ""No he's gone... He told me so"". My first thought is that pappaw told him so. Maybe him and my mom were having problems I didn't know about so I tried getting some info. I said who told you? Pappaw? He said ""No HIM"" and points to the wall where a picture of a deer was hanging. I asked ""who?"" and he says ""HIM mommy. HIM right there"" pointing the whole time towards this picture.

We continued for a while with the ""who?/him! Thing with my son getting more and more angry that I couldn't see who he was talking about. I asked him if he meant the deer in the picture and told him that was just a deer like Bambi (he was roughly 2ish at this time) he said ""NO MOMMY. He's mean and he looks at me like this"" and proceeded to drop his head down and GLARE at me through his eyelashes. Very creepy coming from a 2 year old who's extremely emotional and sweet!

I told him to come over into my lap and sit with me so he did then promptly fell asleep in my lap. Little things after that, like lights turning off by themselves, things somehow getting lost or misplaced noises. Just the little things people don't usually think about much. Fast forward to my youngest son. He lays in his crib being cute and starts laughing and smiling at nothing. Always looking up toward the ceiling. We figure he's a happy baby.

When he's older he comes to us saying someone's tapping him on the shoulder and won't stop. We put our arms around him thinking maybe a muscle spasm. Feeling nothing spasming we ask if it stopped and he says yes with a smile. Now here's the big kicker. Brace yourselves.

The room they were in (my room now to protect them) was terrifying to them. The daytime they were ok. But at night they did NOT want to go in there ESPECIALLY if it was dark in there. I went in one night with my youngest (who's usually the first to try something with no thought of danger) to get his blankie (he was 2 ish at this time) and when I walked in the room he stayed back by the door. I didn't want him afraid of his room and thought maybe he was just pretending so he wouldn't have to go to bed. So I made him go in with me while it was dark to get his blankie. He went in alright but when he got to the bed (where I was already sitting) he was trembling so bad when I pulled him up on my lap that he had my body shaking a little from it. I asked him why he was so afraid (knowing he wasn't pretending now) and he told me ""the boy said this is HIS room and not ours and that we're not allowed in it""... Um what?! This coming from a 2 year old. I was more than a little shocked because he was creative but didn't have the imagination to come up with something of this magnitude on his own. And he was genuinely terrified.

So we switched rooms with the boys. I've told him anytime he feels the tapping or anything like that to say out loud ""This is my house"" or just a simple ""Leave me alone"". I've heard him playing alone and all of a sudden he'll say ""LEAVE ME ALONE"" even though he's alone in the room. Now we have a daughter too (1 1/2) and she has issues sleeping through the night sometimes. She'll wake up screaming as if from a bad dream or something, occasionally shaking. I don't know if something's bothering or scaring her, but every time I go into her room in the middle of the night I say quite loudly ""LEAVE ME CHILDREN ALONE"". I did do some EVP work one day (though I don't have the digital recorder, just tape) and I caught a voice of a young child saying what sounded to me like ""You here?"" in a curious sweet sounding voice.

I played it for my kids not mentioning what I heard and both of their faces lit up when they heard it. Now yesterday my mother mentions that she was in bed the other night while we were gone and while she was laying there trying to go to sleep she feels her covers being pulled and tugged like a small child was trying to climb up on the bed. She didn't really know what to think so she turned on her side and continued to lay there. Then she said it felt like someone was jumping on the bed beside her.

I have yet to do a full investigation of my house simply because I need more equipment, but want to and will post any finding on here when/if I get a chance to investigate.

My Best Friend and His Ghosts,"Illinois, United States",Poltergeists / Physical Manifestations,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Poltergeists / Physical Manifestations :: My Best Friend and His Ghosts

I have always had an interest in the paranormal, as a child, I found reading ghost stories was more fun than playing with Barbie's. I am 26 now, but at the time of meeting my friend's ghost, I was just 16.

My best friend Michael had always claimed his house was haunted, but like a good 'ghost tracker' (which is what I thought of myself at the time) I always remained somewhat skeptical. Every year, his parents made a big snowmobiling trip, going to Wisconsin 2 or 3 times through the winter, and this would be the first time he and his sister would not have a babysitter. (They were a little more than paranoid about teens in the house unsupervised). So like all responsible teenagers, Michael and Casey (his sis) made sure to break as many rules as possible in the shortest possible time frame, so they invited me over to hang out. (Their parents didn't like me much at the time, but that has changed)

So with free reign on the house, we made a mess cooking food, watching movies, and cranking the music. Casey and I had decided that music was more fun (dancing and what-not) than movies, so we went through our cumulative collections to finally decide on Marilyn Manson's Smells Like Children CD. Any Manson fans know, the CD starts with the song, The Hands of Small Children, which is about as creepy as it gets.

So there we are getting the CD set up, with Michael bouncing around the room, and the darn thing just won't play. After like 6 other CD's played fine, just this one won't work. Frustrated, I asked Michael to go grab my soda from the kitchen. At the time, I had 2 cans on the table, one 3/4 filled with soda, and one with a couple of drops in it that I was using for an ashtray (one of the reasons his parents weren't too fond of me).

So Casey and I continue to struggle with the CD player, trying not to break anything, when we both hear noises coming from the kitchen. I am used to Michael's random outbursts (one of the reasons we've been friends for 15 years), so I just ignore him. Then all at once, the CD comes on blaring, Casey and I both jump up in surprise, and Michael's whimpers got louder.

We both popped our heads around the corner of the kitchen to see Michael standing still, whimpering, with his arm out, pointing at the table. Casey and I looked at each other, and stepped further in the kitchen. ""What?"" I asked. He just kept whimpering. ""WHAT?!?"" we both shouted. Michael slowly looked at me with the biggest; most frightened eyes I had ever seen and just keeps whimpering and pointing. So apparently I was missing something.

I finally get a grip on what he is pointing at, the cans on the table. One of which is moving. By itself. As we watched the more filled can of soda, slowly moved around the other can and started moving to the edge of the table, picking up speed as it went. As it got to the end of the table, Michael (in a state of shock) picked it up and put it back, next to the other can (the ashtray). It kept moving. Making a beeline for the edge of the table. Again.

At this point we are laughing and crying in hysterics, not sure what to do or say. I remember having Casey by the pony tail, ready to pull her out in the 3 feet of snow if things got worse. They didn't that night, but I think that was the start of a 9 month period of crazy paranormal experiences in his house.

In the time that has passed I have seen white and black shadows in his home, one of which is the elderly woman that owned the house before them (she died in the bathtub). I have seen and heard dogs and cats that they do not own, and have seen a cat sitting in their window. I have heard footsteps and banging. And there is whispering that you can follow down the basement stairs to the laundry room. Their computer turns it self on when you approach it (convenient!), but the TV will change channels on you in a 6-6-6-9-6-6-6-9 pattern (scary). One of the oddest things to date is the appearance of purple and yellow orbs in the laundry room. From all my research, orbs visible to the naked eye are rare. I have seen pillows jump from the couch to the floor, and the rocking chair in the living room likes to rock when someone sits in the room alone.

Michael doesn't live with his parents anymore, but we do visit and the ghosts always let us know that they are still around.

The Spirit in my Home,Ireland,Family / Friends Visits,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Family / Friends Visits :: The Spirit in my Home

T his story is a collection of memories from my mother and some of my own experiences, all have been recorded straight after they happened so this is an accurate account. I shall begin by explaining the history of the house. I used to live in a house in Divis Drive, Belfast in N. Ireland. The house is now 94 years old. It was built by a small construction company which shut down soon after it built my house. Nobody had bought the house before the bankruptcy so it was sold to a friend of my grandfather's for a miniscule amount of money. My grandfather purchased the property by challenging his friend to a bet which he won.

The 'Troubles' in Ireland had now flared up and a militant assassin used a sniper rifle to murder my grandfather on the front porch of the house (while he was smoking a pipe remember this). Nothing of particular historic interest happened after that.

I begin my story with my mother's memories; I will not mention them all because many of them are similar or identical to each other. She and her husband had just moved into the house sometime in the 1970s, it was a gradual move because of many different factors I will not explain.

My grandmother joined my parents for dinner. They commenced to talk and be cheerful until my mother smelled pipe smoke. In that period in time pipes were common and the smell was well known. My mother asked who was smoking a pipe, nobody else smelled it. She attempted to ignore it but failed and she went to investigate. The acrid stench of smoke was so thick in the hallway that my mother gagged and coughed. She could see nobody there but she felt as though she was being watched and she kept seeing little flashes of something unexplained moving near the door which always vanished before she had time to focus on it. This is an experience which my mother had experienced on many, many occasions over the thirty yeas she lived there. The details of this do not vary a lot from time to time.

The next is also a memory but of my brothers. My brother was eight years old at the time and my mother recorded his story straight after he told it. My brother was asleep on the top bed of his set of bunks. He was very young and often rolled off the top bed and landed on the one below which was wider than the top (he still gets teased for this twenty five years later) so he was unharmed.

Usually he would think nothing of it and climb back onto the top bed and go back to sleep but this time when he fell he did not get back up because he heard footsteps. The footsteps sounded as though they were coming from the ground floor of the house. My brother could tell by the volume of the thumps that they were coming up the stairs. He waited for whoever it was to reach the the top but nobody ever came except for formless footsteps, the footsteps sounded sharp on the wooden floor and they brought a choking stench of cigar smoke. He could hear illegible grunts and mutters from the invisible specter. The all went quiet. He was terrified and he ran to tell my mother.

The final story is from my own memory. My mother was always very sensitive to this spirit but I was not. I encounter spirits where ever I go but I did not once even sense the one which lived in my own house. The day we moved out of the house was the only time I ever encountered him. We had packed everything and were about to leave the house forever when my mother turned round and talked to what looked like thin air. I remember exactly what she said ""We are going now and won't be back, would you like to come with us?"" I found this very odd since I did not know what she was talking about at the time. After she said this a powerful odor of pipe smoke appeared in the hallway and a strange coldness appeared, the lights flickered and then it was gone. We left without comment and never returned.

I am guessing the spirit was my grandfather since it smoked a pipe which my grandfather did and stood at the porch where my grandfather often stood and die.

When we moved the spirit chose not to accompany us but to stay in the house he won in a bet.

We met the new occupants of the house three years after they moved in and we subtly asked them if anything at all strange was seen about the house they replied no!

Identical Woman,"Oregon, United States",Misc,"T his happened to my mom, not me. My mom was going to a restaurant with her buds. As she was about to walk in, she turned her head to the right and saw a woman that looked actually like her. The identical woman turned a block, so my mom followed right behind her. The woman turned into a alley, my mom did the same. But when my mom turned into the same alley, the woman was gone. There was no doors, no hiding place for the woman to hide. And it was a dead end.

My mom hasn't seen her since. I have a feeling that my mom's mother was about to have twins, but the other died. I'm not saying my mom had a sister. We don't think my Grandma was pregnant with twins. But we're not sure what it was. So if someone can please tell me and my mom what it was, that would be great. And I'm not lying. I would like to know what you think it was and tell me. My mom still DOES NOT know what it was. So please tell us...

Childhood Terror,"Arizona, United States",A Haunted Life,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: A Haunted Life :: Childhood Terror

I should start out by saying that I have experienced paranormal activity since I can remember. This particular instance is the first that I can actually recall in full detail.

I was about 4 years old and would have nightmares through the night. I would wake up sweating, sometimes crying because they frightened me so bad. What would scare me even more is what I would see when I would open my eyes. Mind you, I was fully awake at this point. I would always see just across the room a floating head (of sorts), usually with a skull or demonic looking face in the middle. It was generally white and misty. I would squeeze my eyes shut, trying hard to get it to go away, and reopen just to have it still there and staring at me.

I remember then focusing on this being, making sure that it wasn't just a shadow or something in my room making that shape. I realize it sounds ridiculous that a 4 year old can have the much insight, but I had always been mature for my age. I would pray and pray, but nothing would happen. Eventually, I would become so terribly overwhelmed with fear that I would begin to scream and bang on the wall that separated mine and my parent's room, begging my dad to come in the room with me.

He would drag in there, push me over, and lay in front of me on the twin bed so that I was against the wall. At times, I would peek over to see if the being was still there, and 9 times out of 10, it still was. My dad was unaware and just went right to sleep.

At any rate, this being still haunts me. It definitely isn't as frequent as when I was younger, but I'll know when it appears. The presence in the room will be so strong and so dark that I begin to shake, but can't physically move to turn the lights on. I become paralyzed with fear. If anyone has any ideas on how to send this terror back where it belongs, that would be awesome. I have tried to several rituals, but it always comes back no matter what. I'm tired of being scared, and tired of being terrified of the dark.

Grandma Pays a Visit,"Florida, United States",Family / Friends Visits,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Family / Friends Visits :: Grandma Pays a Visit

W hen I was 14 I lived with my parents in the small town of Homestead, Fl. And my Grandmother lived in a trailer a few miles away. When my father took a job in Ft. Lauderdale he sold the house and my Grandma's trailer and moved us all into our new home in Hollywood, Fl. Since I was getting older I got a new waterbed and my bunk bed was taken apart and made into two beds. These were put into my Grandma's room and she slept on one of them.

Grandma was always a very psychic person. My mother told me a story about how when she had miscarried what would have been an older sister she knew before being told and just showed up at the hospital asking for my mother before she even arrived! This was in the late 40's. Then one day I found out for myself when I called her one day and she answered the phone ""hello Gene"". This was way before caller I.D.

Well Grandma died a year after we moved into the new house and she was cremated and her ashes put in an vase and placed in her old room. Years later I was married to my wife for 4 years when she developed breast cancer. She had it bad and had to have both breast removed along with all her lymph nodes in the area. Before the surgery we moved into my parents house so that my mother could look after my wife as I worked two jobs. We stayed in my Grandma's old room because of the two beds. I didn't want to bump my poor wife in my sleep.

One night I awoke to my wife calling out to me, ""Did you see her!"" By the time I opened my eyes I could see nothing so I asked what it was that she saw. She told me that at the foot of her bed there had been a young woman in an old nurses outfit and cap. It had a Red cross on both the cap and on her breast.

Well, I didn't really know what to think so I calmed her down and went back to sleep. The next morning we told my Mother about what had happened at breakfast. She had this all knowing look in her eye and she got up and went into the other room for about ten minutes. When she returned she had an old box of photographs. She took one out and showed it to my wife. Now understand she had never met my grandma and had only seen pictures of her when she was old. My wife instantly cried out ""that was the woman she had seen!""

She showed me the picture and sure enough it was of a young woman in an old nurses uniform. Mother then told me for the first time that Grandma had been a Red Cross nurse during WW1.

Well, we assumed that Grandma was just being a good Nurse and checking up on my wife. But my wife's cancer was spreading into her spine and brain and she soon died. It was then that I realized that she was there to prepare her for her journey. To welcome her to the afterlife. I could not help but be a believer now!

Mommy Ego 2,"Texas, United States",Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: Mommy Ego 2

A s you all know, something is a little off with this house . A lot of people asked about the parents. Like I said in the story above, we had been blamed for a lot of what happened in the house. My aunt Nancy has an Autistic son who is the oldest and keeps to himself, 2 daughters, amy and vivian, and her youngest son is mike. They had a white lab named Lucky, and Nancy's husband's name is Bubba

The area they live in is on what used to be the outskirts of Austin Texas, the city has expanded exponentially in the past 10 years. Based on bits and pieces of research I have done, the area had been inhabited by the Tonkawa tribe, spaniards in search of gold from Mexico city, as well as some of the early settlers from around the time Texas gained its independence. Based on the fact that this neighborhood sits on the edwards aquifer, with Dittmar Creek running through it, my guess is that it was a popular area to settle in no matter who you are. Lots of trees, water and what seems to still be small chunks of farm land hidden off in the bushes even to this day.

My aunt told me herself that while she was out in the yard gardening, she could have sworn she saw a woman in some pilgrim styled clothing, it was blue with white lace edging, and she was riding in a carriage down the street when she suddenly faded and vanished after turning her head to look at my aunt. Now my aunt is a devout Mormon and will make up every excuse in the book to deny what she saw was a ghost, she's even gone so far as to say it was a holy spirit watching over her house. Her son mike, who is now 19 will still argue with her, explaining that was Mommy Ego .

Mommy Ego, from what I have been told is the lady who's been trying to punish my cousin for something, and she doesn't call him by his name, she called him Nathaniel, so I think it would be safe to assume that she thinks Mike is her son.

Strange people have always lived in the area, some natural gas lines run through a certain part of the neighborhood and we used to walk it because it was all cleared out and the grass was kept under control, it was our little shortcut home from school. There was a woman who was rumored to be a gypsy, as well as an old old man who would turn up in the most oddball places and the strangest times. Whenever we would ask him what he was doing he would get angry and threaten to shoot us if we didn't leave him be.

There was a hill on the other side of the bridge I mentioned that goes over the creek and has bats under it... The top of the hill has an old rickety gate, and fence posts made out of actual tree branches. The area looks like some sort of horse ranch. In Austin there are Texas Live Oaks EVERYWHERE... Well on this property is a massive oak tree with about 4 gallows set up around it. The funny thing about this place now that I mention it, is the name of a main road that passes through the area, One road is called ""Convict Hill"" and another is called ""Slaughter Lane"" that actually creeps me out even more, I will be sure to research why they were given those names.

The area is old and parts over grown, it was developed in the late 60s and due to the rate at which the city is growing, it was poorly maintained. Snakes were common in the creeks and tall grasses, mostly cotton mouths, copper heads, rattlesnakes and coral snakes. You get the occasional grass snake as well.

Some odd things we found in the area include: Petrified wood, arrow heads, stones with strange etchings made in them. Dead animals all throughout the creek ranging from cats, dogs, livestock and some things I have never seen before. Not once did we find a dead or injured bat, its likely something that small would get washed away in the creek. Same with birds and rodents. We crawled up into a brushy area once and found a small cleaning with old wooden fishing poles and a mino cage sitting in the water rusting away. The are always had a feeling to it that something just wasn't right.

I think that about sums it all up. On a lighter note I'll give you a quick story that scared the jeebers out of me. My aunt kept a deep freezer in the garage, and the attic entrance was in there as well. The attic had no door or later, it was just a square hole in the ceiling with edging around it and cross beams a few feet about the entrance, beyond that was pure darkness. Mike always said that's where Mommy Ego would sleep because it was always dark.

Well one day we were allowed to get some push pops, the delicious orange ones. When we opened the garage we heard whispering, both of us looked up and there staring at us with malice in her eyes was a woman, her brown semi curly hair dangling down. This was one of those moments that seemed like it would never end, we were both paralyzed with fear. She started to moan as if she was deeply upset, the type of moan actors make when they pretend their husband is dying in their arms, as she was moaning she started to grit her teeth and she propped herself up like she was getting ready to come down.

We ran out screaming like little girls. I ran into my uncles room, apparently he was asleep, I jumped up on the bed and landed right on his gut which did not make him happy. He let out a yell, I was so scared I didn't stop to realize it was just my uncle, I ran outside of his room out the back door and climbed up in the little fort we had built next to the swing set. My older cousins teased me for it but no matter how many times I told them to go in there and see for themselves they didn't have the guts to do it.

I got in trouble for waking my uncle up like that and as he was going back to his room I saw him dead bolt the garage door, and the door knob. He had this look in his eye that a person gets when they have to deal with something they really don't want to deal with. He pushed on the door to make sure it wouldn't budge then went back into his room. He knew we weren't lying about what we saw. Mike had gone clear out the front door and across the street where he waited for his mom to ask what the hell was going on.

Anyway I hope this was good enough, sorry I couldn't post something more official. Next time Ill talk about my little reunion

Well like I said it was my aunts house, she just watched us a lot after school. As to where the parents were, they had been present for a lot of the occurrences as well but in this particular event they had all gone out for the night and left their 2 oldest daughters to baby sit us. The younger of the 2 is 5 years older than myself. Sorry its taken so long to reply, I didn't know it got published so soon. I have tons of experiences involving this particular house but its really hard to put them all into one huge document because I sometimes leave out the details or mix the order in which the events happen which can make it hard to read. I will post again tonight, I'm not sure how long it takes exactly to get published but I'm glad you all enjoy my traumatic experiences. As for that night, when you are exhausted from being up all hours of the morning, you don't want to open the door because you fear something bad may happen, you sit there, paranoid, staring at the door waiting and eventually you succumb to sleep. I didn't mean for it to sound like everything just stopped and we said ok sleep time! Sorry for the misconception.

In the Middle of Nowhere with the Boogie Men,"Indiana, United States",Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: In the Middle of Nowhere with the Boogie Men

W hen I was a little girl I lived in rural Southern Indiana. My family's home was in a very remote area. The land we lived on always gave off a bad vibe. Early on before we had a house built we lived in a trailer home made from two railroad trailers (where railroad workers lived while on the job). My mother and I had many encounters with the ""unexplainable"" there.

A rowdy group of ghosts talked loudly and played music from midnight until early in the morning next to her bed every night until we moved from there. Music would flow through the windows at all hours. This also happened after we had the new house built. All of us heard walking in the hallway several times. At first I was really scared and then once used to it, I was totally curious. We never had real proof, but it seems the railway workers didn't realize they had died and kept on as usual.

One evening I was ready for bed and went to kiss my mother goodnight. As I was leaning toward her where she was sitting, I looked up at the window behind her. There staring at me was a skeleton's face! I was completely terrified. I was paralyzed. Why would this horrible thing be where my reflection should be? Mom later told me the color drained from me and I had a sheer look of terror on my face. At the time I told her there was nothing wrong and went to bed. I couldn't tell her what had happened because I didn't have the words. Now I am afraid of windows.

Even after all these years, I have to have my windows shut and locked with dark curtains over them so I cannot see out. Especially at night. I'll stop for now, but you'll hear from me again.

A Reunion with Mommy Ego,"Texas, United States",Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: A Reunion with Mommy Ego

S o as promised I am writing about my reunion with mommy ego! This happened about 2 years ago in 2006, I was living with my grandparents while working and going to college. I was 20 years old at the time. My aunt and her family were staying with my grandparents too, they had just moved back to Austin from new york and needed a place to stay so they could get back on their feet and get settled in. My cousin mike was back, and we were up late one night reminiscing the good ol days and what not... Somehow we got on the topic of spirits and hauntings, and we both came up with the bright idea to drive to his old neighborhood and check out the old house.

At the time it seemed like a good idea, it was 2am and we were bored, we only lived about 3 miles from his old neighborhood so we saw it as something fun to do to kill our boredom. Besides, we both wanted to confirm that it wasn't just childhood nonsense we cooked up as kids, perception of things when you are young can be different if you look at them when you are older so this was an adventure for us.

First stop was the house itself. It was uninhabited to say the least, the sight of it gave us both the heebie jeebies. It had a for sale sign in the front yard which was funny because we both knew why it was for sale. It didn't take us long to hatch the idea of going back inside, it took a bit longer to work up the courage to break into a place that we both knew didn't want us inside. The gardens around the house were over grown in weeds, the neighborhood was dimly lit and not too many people drive around at 2am so it was relatively safe enough to sneak in. The window in the front yard that lead to mikes old bedroom was unlocked, we crawled through and all the images of past experiences rushed into my mind, a thought went through my mind, I was thinking that must have been my welcome back message.

It was quiet inside, the carpet was new, fresh paint, new doors, the tile in the kitchen was the same, it was very very creepy. We turned on the hallway light and the kitchen light, but we didn't want to make the house look too bright from the inside since we had broken in and all... After we had looked around the kitchen and dining room we got to the living room, this is where things went sour. We get the bright idea of opening the door to the garage and seeing if we can look up into the attic to overcome our fear of the place. Bad Idea! I unlocked the door and right after the pop the deadbolt made the door flung open, I jumped back what seemed to be 10 feet, my heart pounding, hair standing up and getting ready to run like hell through a wall or something. Mike just stood there, frozen, staring into the darkness of the garage. I noticed that every cabinet in the kitchen was wide open, the drawers were pulled all the way open, the bathroom and bedroom doors, even the front and back door were all open... Mike was just standing there, and I couldn't help but think that this was a bad bad idea.

I walked up slowly to mike and said dude let's go, he didn't say a word, he just raised his hand and pointed into the garage, frozen, dumbstruck, I don't know what was going on with him but I was scared. When I looked into the garage, what I saw shocked me to the core. About where the opening to the old attic was, a figure swung down in the blackness, my heart dropped into my stomach and I felt like I was going to faint. The figure stood up, about 5 feet tall with a hunched over look, turned and faced us in an instant, then rushed through us with an amazing force that knocked us both on our asses. She ran through both of us, I felt her pass through my body, it was a horrible cold evil feeling that makes me sick just thinking about it. She ran through the living room, hung a left and went straight out the front door. At this point lights are flashing on and off, all the doors are slamming, the water is running, we heard the very familiar thumping in the walls and we high tailed it back to the car and drove away short of breath totally freaked out. We were yelling the whole time ""did you see it? Did you see it? She's freaking real!""

We couldn't believe it, we drove around for a while until our nerves had calmed down a little, we then decided to look for her. First stop, the old bridge. When we got there, the smell of the bat turd hadn't changed a bit. We walked down the hill to look down into the creek, and as we were heading down I stepped on something. I looked down to see what it was, and scattered all over the hill side were these tiny makeshift crosses that had been made with twine and 2 twigs about the thickness of my pinky finger. They were everywhere, and the ends of the twigs were all burned. The 2 twigs in each cross had been fastened together with this twine in a figure eight fashion where you just constantly criss cross it over and over until it doesn't come unraveled. This was baffling because we couldn't think of any reason for this. I picked one up and took it back to the car with me, I wanted to save it for later to look at when my heart and mind aren't racing with anxiety.

When I put my key in the ignition mike shouted ""there she is!"" I looked up to see, and no doubt about it, there she was hobbling up the hill opposite of the hillside we were on. When she got to the road she turned and looked at us, we didn't move, we stared right back at her awestruck. She had a strange cloak on, it was like a wool jacket with a hood but the hood wasn't on her head, her hair was a dark gray and it was up in a bun, she had young face but it had a dark twist to it. Maybe it was the look in her eyes that made my stomach wrench when I looked at her.

She stood there for a while, then she faded out into the darkness. Excited and scared at the same time we drove over to where she was standing, when we got out of the car we could hear a voice coming from down in the creek below, it was a woman's voice and it was wailing loudly in a sorrow filled tone, if that makes any sense. It made me think of the sound a woman might make if she had a loved one taken from her, there was scorn and sorrow all at the same time in this cry. The voice was moving up the creek, away from us, which intersects slightly with another road on its way closer to the old house, so we jumped in the car and drove to the culdesac, we cracked the windows and could still hear the wailing, we got out and walked to the tree line where the creek was. The crying stopped for a moment, everything fell quiet, deathly quiet, we turned around to head back to the car and just as we did there she was, between us and the car, standing there, fists clenched giving us the single most hateful look I have ever seen in my life. I didn't know what to do so I started to back away. After the first step I made she let out a scream and flung her arm at my face, missing me by inches, mike however wasn't so fortunate, she had clawed his face and he was bleeding, I grabbed him, bolted to the car, we got in and drove away completely shaken.

There were 4 deep scratches in mikes face, going from his neck just below his right ear, across his cheek and to his nose/mouth area, he said they didn't hurt except for when it happened, he described it as what it must feel like to tear a persons skin like you would tear a sheet of paper, he said her hand felt like they were made of ice and that afterwards his whole body went numb for a second.

Our once exciting adventure had turned into a living nightmare. The next day when I remembered that I kept one of the little crosses in my car, I went to go grab it but there was no cross there, instead rattle snake laid dead draped over the center console where I had left it. I threw the snake in the trash, completely baffled. Needless to say we decided not to pay mommy ego anymore unexpected visits. We are not welcome there. It still doesn't make sense to me.

How did she unlock all the doors in the house? Why was mikes old bedroom window left unlocked. What was with the crosses and the occurrence of snakes? Why is this woman so angry? I am really shaken up just writing about it, even though I'm several states away now, I feel like she knows when I tell her story and I can't help but get the chills when I do. I still don't know where Mike got the name Mommy Ego from. I am going home on leave in may and I might actually take some pictures of the place... IN THE DAY! Mike is about to go to boot camp in July... Maybe one last reunion with this angry spirit before he goes? I'm not sure its a good idea but this time I would definitely go for the sake of getting it on camera.

Thanks for your enthusiasm about this story, and as always I love feedback. Sorry its so long and poorly structured paragraph wise. I'm not much of a writer.

Mom Always Wins,Spain,Psychic / Medium,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Psychic / Medium :: Mom Always Wins

T his was my first experience as a child with anything to do with ghosts. Since then I have had many of these experiences, seeing as I am a psychic. Well this story takes please when I was 7, it happened when I went to go visit my grandma in spain. My parents had planned a trip for the entire family so we can meet (for some of us) and catch up with my grandma. For the most part it was the most perfect vacation ever.

I have a lot of family in spain and one of my cousins, who I think was 16 at the time, liked to tease us about all the ghosts stories and legends they had there. My older sister and I would usually laugh at his stories but we were actually pretty scared.

One day my cousin said that he can prove to us that one of his stories was true. My sister, who was 13, and I were skeptical about trying this out because we both were very large chickens growing up. In the end we decided to do it.

One night we snuck out of my grandmothers house and met up with my cousin who was conveniently waiting outside by this old tree.

Before we started on out journey he told us the story of the entity we were about to go visit.

He told us that there was this woman who lived in an almost isolated area from anyone else, almost completely deserted by people, They said that this woman had 2 kids which everyone found really strange because this woman had never married or seemed to have signs of a boyfriend or man around. These kids were normal kids... Just like anyone else who you'd meet around this part of the country. They never spoke of their mother... Or father though. When anyone would ask them about their mother they would just say ""she's fine"" and quickly change the subject, and when anyone asked about their father, they would politely say that they didn't have one and leave it at that.

Every year on September 28th one of the kids in town would go missing, and it would always be a child of the age of 9. Every kid that was taken was claimed to be 9. Everyone of course spread rumors about the weird woman and her 2 kids with no father, saying that they were somehow responsible for it. One day of group of 2 men and 1 woman went to go investigate the woman's house.

They walked up to her door and knocked, the woman opened... She seemed surprisingly young for the age she claimed to be, and less insane than most people made her out to be. The 3 visitors asked if they could come in and the woman kept saying no, and kept denying them entrance. One of the men got violent and pushed her out of the way and stormed inside the house looking around the house for anything out of the ordinary.

He found the jack pot as soon as he opened the fist door. There in the room were the woman's 2 children and the missing children from the town.

The woman's 2 kids were playing some sort of ball game with the other missing children. Except that the missing children all seemed really neutral... As if they could care less weather they lived or died. And all the children were missing a limb... A leg... Or an arm...

The men asked the 2 kids what had happened to all the towns children that were there, the kids said ""we brought them here so they could destroy mother... They failed... She always wins... Always wins""

The female visitor was way to scared to continue there so she ran away and made it to the town safe, the other 2 men were never seen again.

Well my sister and I were thinking it was just a stupid story and followed my cousin onward.

As we approached the house we all saw something and then immediately heard a scream. We turned to run, we stop and calmed our selves... We looked back at the house and we all saw a boy, he looked as if he was crying and said ""its too late, mom always wins""

My cousin was out of there before me and my sister could even turn to run. We eventually caught up.

When we were talking about it later my sister said to my cousin ""wasn't it weird how that little boy just appeared out of nowhere then disappeared after like a second""

I turned ghost white and said ""the boy didn't disappear after a second... Didn't you guys hear him say that thing about his mom... He was staring at us as we ran away... ""

My cousin and sister were just staring at me and I almost died of the fright but after about 5 years we figured out why.

I still don't know the rest of the story of this woman and what she ""always wins""... And I am fine not knowing. But that was the first time I saw a ghost... That I recall and to this day it was the most scariest experience of my life!

Fun and Games,"California, United States",Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: Fun and Games

A s I mentioned in my previous story, Foul Smelling Thing , I lived in California. However, I failed to mention that the house I moved into is indeed quite haunted. The ghosts in this house aren't too bad. Harmless actually, compared to the thing that resides in my parents' old house in Calgary.

We have recently moved into a new place, and over the past few months I have been keeping track of some things that go on in the house.

I noticed that every day around 5:30-6:00 at night, the toilet in the main floor bathroom will flush by itself. One night while making dinner, Geri (my fiancé) went to the bathroom. (This was sometime between 5-6pm). She told me that while she was in there, she felt the temperature drop quite a few degrees, and the hair on her neck stood up. She closed the door and was just about to do her business when the toilet flushed very spontaneously on its own. After it flushed she mentioned she felt a cool breeze blow past her (Keep in mind there are no windows in this bathroom) and the temperature returned to normal.

My brother is still living with us, and we figure that his room is the most haunted in the house. He hasn't exactly been lucky with his rooms. (If you read my last story you would know what I'm talking about.) He says that on occasion, he will be woken up to his bed moving very gently back and forth. Other times he'll feel a weight at the foot of his bed as if someone had sat down. When he gets home from school he will head straight up to his room to do his studies and crank his stereo. He says that the CD's will change tracks for no reason, or the volume is being messed with. He'll get up to go fix the problem, and when he turns around, his books and homework are on the floor. The poor guy has been through so much that I think he's learned to just brush it off and ignore it. But then again often times I can hear him upstairs cursing in frustration with ""something...""

Those are the experiences Geri and my little brother deal with, but as for me, I have had a different experience.

One night I was out in the garage working on my bikes. I had a big race that weekend so I wanted to make sure everything was working properly. I was waiting for my mechanic to come by so he could take a look and see if I had missed anything. When he arrived he came in and asked me who the little girl was sitting on my front step. I thought it might have been one of the neighbor's kids or something, so I got up to go see. When I looked around the corner towards my front steps, nobody was there. But there was a little pink ball sitting at the bottom of the steps. I grabbed it and took it to the house a few doors down and left it on their porch. I figured it was one of their kids'.

Me and Grant worked on the bikes for a little while and we stopped to break for a beer. We were talking about the race coming up and who was going to be there, and who's going to be tough competition, when we heard a giggle come from the driveway. We got up and checked to see if anyone was there, but there was nobody to be seen. We walked back into the garage and there, sitting beside my toolbox was a little pink ball. Grant and I looked at each other and agreed something quite out of the ordinary was going on.

We left the ball where it was as we finished the inspections on the bikes, and after Grant left, I picked up the ball and kicked it into the back yard. The ball stays in the same place, except when I mow the lawn. Whenever the ball gets moved it always ends up back in the same spot in the back yard.

We figure that a little girl used to live here, and she continues to play and cause trouble, even when we're there.

We don't mind her, although she can be a trouble maker at times. Messing with Chris' stereo, playing with my theater system, misplacing Geri's make up.

In fact we quite enjoy having her around, she brightens everyone's day.

Memories of a Murderer,Canada,Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: Memories of a Murderer

A s a child, growing up in Western Canada was pretty cool. I lived in Calgary Alberta, home of the Greatest Outdoor Show on Earth, The Calgary Stampede. We went every year to watch the rodeo and spend the night at the midway, and watch the amazing fireworks. I still like to go back every July to see what's new. For those who haven't been, I suggest you go. It truly is the Greatest Outdoor Show on Earth.

When I was 8 years old I remember my parents talking about moving to a house in Airdrie, A small town north of Calgary. My dad works in construction so he would always look for houses that he could fix up. It was the same thing every few years. Move to a new place, fix it up and leave. There was only one problem, every house we moved into was usually 60 - 100 years old and was creepy beyond belief.

I remember going to the house in Airdrie one night with my parents with the realtor. The neighborhood was nice. There was a school just at the end of my block so I could ride my bike to school everyday. We got out of the truck and walked around outside the house while we waited for the realtor. The lot was perfect, it was a corner lot with a huge backyard, perfect for an 8 year old. I was already imagining how much fun it was going to be. Finally the realtor showed up and we went inside. The house was a bi-level so at the front landing there was a set of 4 or 5 steps leading up to the main floor, and just to the left was a larger staircase leading to the basement. I was intrigued because I never saw something like that before.

My parents were up in the kitchen going over the pricing and whatever for the house, so I decided to go into the basement and see what my dad had to work with. It was undeveloped which was weird because the house was 54 years old at the time. You would think someone would have put some drywall up, or at least some carpet. I noticed in the corner that there were some old cans of paint and an old toolbox full of antique tools. I opened the toolbox and found an old hammer, screwdriver, and an old newspaper clipping from 1976. When I pulled the clipping out and began to read it my dad came downstairs and asked if I was ready to go. All I got to read from the headline was ""Murder..."" and I looked over to my dad and showed him what I found. My dad was fascinated, because he was a collector of antique tools and stuff. (Those tools still sit in his display cabinet today.) He also took the newspaper clipping, but I never saw it again.

A few weeks later we moved in. I was so excited. I was helping my mom paint my room, when I heard my dad from the basement call up to my mom. She told me to finish the wall we were working on, but I insisted that I go with her. When we got to the bottom of the basement stairs I saw my dad scrubbing the concrete floor. He looked up and told me to go upstairs and watch some cartoons, so I did. What child would pass up on the opportunity to watch cartoons? I didn't think anything of what I just saw. I figured he had spilled something and wanted my moms help. We'll get to the real reason in a bit.

After watching cartoons I went to bed. I slept on the couch in the living room because my room had just been painted. I awoke to the sound of a man's voice. It sounded like he was arguing with someone. I listened for a few minutes before calling out, ""Dad are you going to be done down there soon?"" I figured he was getting frustrated with something he was working on. Then suddenly the voice stopped and I called out again, ""Dad? Are you..."" just then my dad came out of his room which was on the other end of the house, nowhere near the basement stairs.

""What's going on?"" He asked. And I just looked at him with probably the most dumbfounded look ever.

I told him what had just happened and he assured me it was the guys outside. We lived next to a party house so there were usually very loud and obnoxious teenagers out every weekend. But I knew it wasn't coming from outside. I was certain that the voice was coming from the basement, because it seemed as if it was carrying up the stairs and into the living room. But once again my dad assured me it was nothing. I fell back to sleep and nothing else happened that night.

As time went on my dad was making progress with developing the basement. When it was time to put the carpet in we noticed that things were starting to take a turn for the worse. It seemed the house became tense. Everyone was angry with everybody, which was unusual, because my family was so tight-knit and not to mention I lived in a house with strong Christian beliefs.

A few months finally passed and my dad had completed the basement. The carpet was all in, the walls were painted, and the bathroom was all done. My mom and I hung a beautiful picture on the wall that had the verse ""He who believes in Me as the scripture has said, out of his heart will flow rivers of living water"". ~Jesus John 7:38. This verse was important to my mom so she put it up in every house. One day me and my brother were playing outside, and my mom came outside. She was very angry; I'll never forget the look on her face. She took us downstairs and showed us the mess we apparently made. There was a huge stain on the rug, a deep, deep red color, and it was still a little wet. I looked at my mom and assured her that it wasn't me. She looked at my little brother and had a nice little talk with him about how we weren't allowed to have kool-aid in the basement. He argued for a quite a while that he didn't spill anything.

I really wasn't sure what was going on, and never did until we had moved back to Calgary. I didn't know why but we had only lived in that house for about 9 months. But a few years ago (I was 20 at the time) we got together for Christmas dinner, and we were talking about the past and how cute we were when we were little, and I brought up the ""kool-aid"" stain on the rug. And that's when my dad cut in and told us what really happened. He mentioned the newspaper clipping I had found. He told us that a man and his wife lived in that house, and one night they got into an argument. The wife admitted to her husband that she was having an affair, and that she wanted a divorce. The man was furious and shot and killed his wife. He then took his own life.

I looked at my dad in shock, and asked him about the time I went in the basement and saw him scrubbing the floor. He told me it was an old bloodstain. I looked at him with the same dumbfounded look I gave him 12 years before. He also told us that the night after he finished scrubbing the floor, he woke up and noticed a dark figure standing in his doorway. He fell back to sleep then woke up again, only to find the shadowy figure standing directly over him.

Me and my brother were shocked. My mom cut it and told us about her experiences in the house. My mom had an old china doll that was given to her from her grandmother, that she kept on a little rocking chair in their room. She told us that sometimes she would go into the room and she would find the doll sitting right in the middle of the floor. It started happening more and more frequently and the doll even made its way up onto her pillow.

Then she told us that she had the exact same experience as my dad. She said that when she went downstairs to clean up the stain on the carpet, she realized that it wasn't juice at all. You can probably guess what it was. She called for my dad and he looked at it and I guess it was in the exact same spot on the floor as the previous stain had been. So he told my mom to clean it up and he would make arrangements for our Pastor to come by and bless the house. That night, after my mom cleaned up the mess, she noticed the black figure in the doorway, and it proceeded to come closer to her. She shot up and yelled at my dad to wake up, as soon as she did, the figure disappeared.

That was enough for my parents, so a week or two later we moved back to the city. My mom ended up leaving her favorite picture in the basement. Now I know why. I figured dad was finished with the renovations and we were off to another fixer-upper.

A little while ago, I took my fiancé to the house just to show her where we used to live. When we arrived at the house, the windows were all boarded up and there was a sign on the lawn that said ""Property for sale"" and it had a bunch of C/S stickers that had been ripped off. Obviously anyone who had gone in to buy the house was left with a very uneasy feeling. I was sad, not because those people were scared of the house, but because my poor dad put so much work into that basement and made a beautiful built in cabinet, and now no one is going to be able to enjoy it. And sometimes I wonder, what became of that verse that my mom left hanging on the wall... Maybe one day I'll go back and get it. That is, if the spirit didn't ruin it in some way.

Sat by a Ghost,"California, United States",Old Hags / Night Attacks / Sleep Paralysis,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Old Hags / Night Attacks / Sleep Paralysis :: Sat by a Ghost

I don't remember what month it was, but I remember I was only 8 or 9 years old, and my father had to leave town for the night. Since I am the youngest child, I was chosen to sleep with my mother for the night since she can't sleep on her own. That night, she slept on my father's side while I slept on my mother's side. I was kind of scared to sleep on her side since she gets sit on by a ghost every now and then.

Well, that night I slept fine. The next early morning, my mother woke me up while she was getting out of bed. I heard her left to the bathroom, so I just laid in bed trying to go back to sleep. Less than five minutes, I felt like something was coming towards, and all of a sudden I felt a hand creeping towards my stomach. Right then, I tried to get up as quick as I could, but couldn't move. I tried to call for my mom and I tried to move but couldn't. So I gave up, because I knew there was no way he/she would get off of me.

About a few minutes later, I felt the heaviness off of my body. I was so scared I got up and left the room. I told my mother about what happened and she laughed. She then told me that I got sat on because I was sleeping on her side and they (the ghost) thought I was my mother. After she told me, I went and slept in my room.

Walking Soldier,"Hawaii, United States",Apparitions / Voices / Touches,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Apparitions / Voices / Touches :: Walking Soldier

O ne morning at about 0430 on my way to work I was running late and didn't want to miss morning muster. I live in military housing in Camp Stover which is located on post in Wheeler Army Air Field (one of the first places attacked on Dec. 7th 1941).

It isn't unusual to see troops road march that early in the morning so I didn't think much of it.

As I was driving past the old Army Housing there was a Soldier dressed in Desert Cami's with a full pack on crossing the street.

I had to slow down in order not to hit this guy with my car. I began to get upset because he started walking slower. When I was finally able to pass him I rolled down my passenger window to yell at him, then he disappeared. As soon as the Soldier got to the curb he just vanished.

I had no idea what to think or do so I called my wife on her cell phone and woke her up and told her what happened. She didn't believe me at first but once she heard the fright in my voice she knew it wasn't a joke.

I don't know who that soldier could have been, but since the war started there have been many Hawaii based Soldiers from Schofield Barracks and Wheeler AAF have been killed in combat and helicopter crashes.

Dragon Lady,"California, United States",Old Hags / Night Attacks / Sleep Paralysis,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Old Hags / Night Attacks / Sleep Paralysis :: Dragon Lady

T his is a true story that happened to my cousin's boy friend. I do not want to tell his real name, so let's call him Bob.

One night, Bob went fishing with his friends. It was really dark at the fishing place, but Bob thought he saw something, but never said anything. He just kind of ignored and went on fishing. The next day, him and his friend's left home. When he arrived home, he went to bed. Before he fell asleep, he felt a ghost sat on him. He ignored and thought it was nothing, but it kept happening the next night and the next and so on.

He told his mom about it and his parents did the hmong ritual. The shaman guy told the family that there's a Dragon lady who likes their son and won't leave him alone. She wants him and she will take him with her someday. The shaman guy also said that there is no way for them to make her leave because no one has no power to make her leave. She'll leave when she wish to. The dragon lady told the shaman man for my cousin to not marry Bob too, and if she does marry Bob then she'll kill my cousin. This is not only the freaky part, but my cousin told me about one night when Bob and her were at her place.

It was probably 11:00pm, and Bob and my cousin were sitting on the couch. Bob and her were talking and having a conversation. He was stroking her hair and talking sweet to her. Their conversation probably went on for about five to ten minutes. All of a sudden, Bob seemed like he just got up from a good nap and knew nothing about their conversation. My cousin got scared so she told him to get out because she was thinking that he was possessed by the Dragon lady.

Shadow People on the Queen Mary,"California, United States",Ghost Tours & Haunted Hotels,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Ghost Tours & Haunted Hotels :: Shadow People on the Queen Mary

I n March my husband and I went to the Queen Mary as the first stint of our honeymoon. I am very eager to learn about ghosts and see evidence for myself, however I am also one to speculate if what I am seeing is supernatural or just a reaction from something else. I am not the type to just believe everything is supernatural. With that being said I have had experiences on the Queen Mary that I couldn't explain other than to say there is something on that ship that isn't human any longer.

The one and only night we were on the ship we had booked a room. During the day we walked the ship and learned more of her history. We had a nice lunch and saw the ballroom and many areas that were just gorgeous. At night we decided to take the Haunted Tour. I was skeptical at first because it seemed most in our group were seeing anything and everything as supernatural so it made it hard to concentrate on sounds and things around us.

The first part of the tour I noticed nothing that was real remarkable and was feeling as though we wasted our money. We continue the tour and head to the boiler room. As our group walked in the tour guide (Erika Frost) a security guard and another guide that brought up the back of the pack all entered in this area. The security guard locked the gate behind us and we walked down several very dark corridors, very steep staircases and very tight quarters.

Getting our way down to the area where the POW's were contained when the ship was a military vessel. As the group gets settled down we were instructed to shut off our flashlights and let our senses settle into the area. We all sat patiently and quietly for roughly 2 minutes, when I heard what sounded like a woman's heeled shoe walking above us. At the same time I hear this walking, I hear a voice clearly saying ""help us"". It was methodical, yet growing closer. The walking sounded as though it was coming down the stairs until someone spoke and the walking stopped.

I continued to hear the ""help us"" until someone turned on their flashlight again. To say the least I had the chills but was so anxious to continue the tour. The rest of the tour I had no experiences until we came to the pool area. In there my husband was VERY uncomfortable, stating that someone or something was watching him and he didn't like it. All the dark corners and spaces seem to draw my eye. I took several photos in this room and caught several very large orbs.

But the best moment was when we walked in the changing rooms. In there each group of two got in a shower stall, turned off our flashlights, sat in pretty much perfect darkness until our eyes started to kind of focus. I could see clearly the outline of the people in the stall across from us.

However very quickly there were black figures walking right outside our stall. The black was so dense that the people I could once see were now GONE. The black mass or figure stopped outside our stall and I had this urge to touch it. I stuck my hand out and quickly pulled it back as it was SO cold. I touched my husbands arm and he said it was freezing. Right about that time Erika stated that something was going on outside our stall... Of course I definitely agreed with her. Upon leaving the pool area my husband said he felt instantly better as he was feeling very light headed and weak.

We slept that night on the Queen Mary with no further incidence, however I never felt ""good"" health wise while on the ship. My head was pounding and I just felt almost sad. Upon leaving the hotel I felt instantly better.

Friend Comes Back in Dreams,"California, United States",Family / Friends Visits,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Family / Friends Visits :: Friend Comes Back in Dreams

I truly believe that here is life after death and that your loved ones come to you in many different ways. This story is about a friend of mine that passed away and how he came to me in several dreams.

I was a Freshman when Jose and I began dating. He was such an amazing person, always smiling and making everyone laugh. We dated for a couple of months and after a while realized that it wasn't going to work out between us so we broke up. We didn't talk too much after we broke up. I would see him from time to time but we would say much to each other.

The last time I saw him was when I was walking to one of my classes. I hadn't seen him in a while. I remember saying to him, ""What you can't say hi anymore""? He smiled his usual smile and went on his way. I didn't know that would be the last time I would see him.

Monday, March 24th 2003 I get a phone call from my friend telling me that Jose had been hit by a car and that he probably wouldn't make it. My mom called all the hospitals in our town to see how he was doing. She finally found the hospital and spoke to his brother. Jose was gone. I cried so much. I just couldn't believe he was really gone.

About month after his death is when I began having dreams about him. The first dream I had of him took place at the community that I lived at. He told me that he was ok and for not to cry for him anymore. He was being his usual smiley self.

The next dream I had of him took place right before my Quincenera (Mexican version of a sweet 16). In the dream we were at my Qincenera and he was hanging out with us and having a good time. I knew all along that he was dead in my dream but that didn't seem to bother me.

The last dream I had of him kind of scared me a bit. In the dream we were having a second funeral for him. I was standing in a room right next where the casket would be placed. They began to bring him in and they placed the casket so that his back was toward me. All of a sudden a heard a cell phone ring and it was his and he answered it. I was in total shock. I remember asking my mom why he was doing this. At that point a man walked up to Jose and Jose began to cry and touched the man's face. Jose lay back down and I again asked my mom why he was doing that. As I said that Jose got up and turned around and looked right at me and then I woke up.

I don't know what exactly these dreams meant but they felt so real. It felt as if he was really trying to communicate with me. It has been several years since I have had those dreams and I can still remember them perfectly. It's been 5 years since Jose death and I miss him dearly. I truly believe that he was trying to let me know that he is still with us in spirit.

My Grandma's Old House,Australia,Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: My Grandma's Old House

I live in Queensland, Australia in a small suburb about twenty minutes from the ocean. Around eight years ago my grandmother decided that she wanted to live closer to us and bought the house next door. I was around six or seven at the time. The house had four bedrooms. The they were separated by the kitchen and living area. There was a small hallway which the main bedroom and a second bedroom were down and the other two rooms came off the living room.

When my parents went away I would always stay with my Grandma. I never liked staying there and asked if instead of sleeping in the bedroom, could I sleep on the couch. My Grandma used to wait until she thought I was asleep and then move me into the bedroom.

I could never sleep there. No matter how hard I tried I used to end up staying awake the whole night waiting for the sun to come up. One night when I finally did get to sleep, something woke me up. I don't know what it was, but when I looked at the doorway I saw the dark shadow of what looked like a tall, thin man. I pulled the blankets over my head and stayed like that until I finally went back to sleep.

My Grandmother moved out of that house several years later and is now living with us. I had convinced myself that what I had seen was my imagination and had not thought about it for years when my cousin came to stay (she is twenty-seven).

She and I were talking about ghosts and other things when she brought up my Grandmother's old house. She told me the following story:

She had been sleeping in the main bedroom, which for some reason my Grandmother had given her to stay in. My grandmother and aunt (my cousin's mother) were down the other end of the house. My cousin woke up, needing to go to the bathroom. She did not like to use the bathroom that connected to the main bedroom because she found it ""creepy"" so she walked down to the other end of the house.

When she was walking back from the bathroom she thought she heard shuffling footsteps on the carpet behind her, but when she turned there was no one there. She got back into bed and turned over. She then said that she had a weird feeling so she turned onto her back to find someone standing at the foot of her bed. She could not see them very clearly in the dark and thought she had woken her mother.

""Sorry if I woke you"" she said to them. The figure did not reply. My cousin took a closer look at the person and realized that it was not her mother, nor my grandmother. She put the blankets over her head and screamed as loudly as she could.

My grandmother and aunt came running into the bedroom to find it empty. When my cousin told them what happened they thought that there was an intruder in the house. They searched the whole house and checked the doors and windows, but found no one, or any signs of forced entry. Before I told my cousin what I had seen I asked her what this figure looked like. She said it was a tall, thin man.

I told my mother of both my cousin's and my experience and she told me that a man had committed suicide in the garage of the house. I never told my cousin that though, because my mother told me that it would scare her too much.

I don't think the ghost wished us any harm, it was just his way of letting us know that he was there.

I Saw Someone in my Parent's Room,"Virginia, United States",Apparitions / Voices / Touches,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Apparitions / Voices / Touches :: I Saw Someone in my Parent's Room

W hen I was a little girl, three years old to be exact, I fell asleep in my parents' room while watching a movie, I awoke some hours later, and if I remember correctly it was about 3 A.M. And the t.v had been turned off, as well as all the lights.

Then I thought I heard the door open, thinking it was my mom or cat (my dad was at work and all my siblings where asleep) I didn't say anything, I just sat up. I saw a flash of light and something appeared in front of the door and it gave of light, pure blinding light. I realized later that it was a woman.

She was tall with a content smile on her face, a beautiful gown long lose brownish-red hair, and bright eyes. She smiled at me, but being the little girl I was, I hid under the covers and shook with fear, I heard a sound, it sounded like someone speaking but I don't remember what she said (it's been about ten years).

Soon after I heard the bathroom door open and being a curious little thing I got up and went into the bathroom, following the Spirit.

When I reached the bathroom she stood in the center and looked back at me one more time and said something along the lines of ""you're a special one"" then she left my little confused mind and me alone.

I ran out of the bedroom and down the stairs as fast as I could to the living room where my mom was playing on the computer,

""Mommy! Mommy! I saw a ghost! Mommy! I'm scared! The-the ghost... she-she... I saw a ghost!""

My mom just told me that I was probably dreaming and to go back to bed. I did as told only this time I made sure I had my teddy bear.

I still don't know who she was or what effect she had on my life but I'll tell you, that's one thing you never forget.

One thing I don't understand is ""why?"" Why did the beautiful spirit appear to me?

I Saw my Mom Who Recently Died,"Virginia, United States",Family / Friends Visits,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Family / Friends Visits :: I Saw my Mom Who Recently Died

M y mother died about a year and a half ago. Last month I was looking at a picture of her before I went to sleep, I held on to the picture as I slept. Before I fell asleep I started to cry, and it got so bad I started to violently shake, my whole body wracked with sobs until a warm voice filled my ears, it said:

""Honey? Baby Doll, why are you cryin' sweetie?"" It was my mothers voice.

""Mommy?"" I said looking up at her, and my whole room looked different:

It was now early morning and the sun shined through my window, it landed at my mom's feet, my mom was in a white gown and her hair was let down her brown eyes where soft and filled with concern.

After registering what I saw I got up off the bed and ran into my mother's arms, and cried.

""Shh baby, shh, I don't want you to be sad Baby Doll, I'm okay. It hurts me to see you down here crying like this. Shh baby shh...""

I stood there in her arms now crying tears of joy that my mom was there with me.

""I don't know how to not be sad Mama. I miss you a lot..."" I sniffled into her shoulder.

""You do honey, you know how to be happy, just be my little Hollywood...""

I closed my eyes and when I opened them again, my mom was gone, it was still nighttime, the time was the same as it was before I saw my mom, again I cried again, but I felt her presence in my room. I ran upstairs and I told my dad what I just saw.

Illusion from a Ghost or Possession?,Australia,Misc,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Misc :: Illusion from a Ghost or Possession?

H i guys I'm 19 and this is my first ever paranormal experience and I didn't like it. (Profanity is used in this story, but not a lot) It happened at my friends house.

At 4:00pm LAST Saturday (yeah it happened just 2 days ago) I was at my friends getting ready for our ""Mario Kart Wii Party""

So while waiting for the other 3 guys to come, my friend was telling us how he heard someone call his name when he was on his computer at around 2am.

(Now in chinese myths, when you hear your name being called out and you don't know who it is, do not answer or do not look back, because apparently there is a ghost standing behind you wanting to take your soul or give you unimaginable bad luck that will cause you to finally take your own life)

So knowing about that he got alittle freaked out and ignored it and put his music up a little higher. After he told us that story, we just laughed and just said that it was 2 in the morning, your mind plays tricks on you. He agreed on that and laughed as well.

Well finally our other friends came and it was about 15 minutes to 7pm if I remembered. We played until 9:30 and I WAS BUSTING TO GO TO THE TOILET, but I was in the middle of a race. So I held it in. After I finished, (I came 3rd BOOO!) I quickly ran to the toilet, while there I felt a chill down my spine and then my blood ran cold and I felt so petrified for some reason and I was thinking in my head ""oh god, please don't"" so I just stood there... Feeling terrified for no apparent reason. Then I heard my friend insult me asking how long it takes for me to just pee. At that time I felt relieved and had a smile on my face.

When I went out the toilet door the walls became wobbly and I felt dizzy, I didn't think much of it. So I ran back and jumped into the gaming room and shouted ""READY TO BE OWNED NOOBS?!"" to my surprise my friends weren't there. So I figured, oh they must of went down to eat (we haven't had dinner yet) So I went down stair and no one was in the kitchen. When I finally realized his family wasn't in the house I got REALLY REALLY freaked out. ""Guys! This isn't funny anymore"" as I yelled out with a smirk on my face, so I ran towards the front door when I opened it THERE WAS A FREAKEN BRICK WALL, at that time I was about to cry so I screamed

""F**k you guys, seriously... THIS ISN'T FUNNY ANYMORE, F**KEN HELL!""

So I walked about feeling terrified, I stopped. Someone or something was behind me and I was so afraid to look back. I felt it RIGHT BEHIND ME! It's breathing was demonic almost gasping.

I was breathing so heavily, then I felt I grab. I screamed so loud (the loudest I have ever screamed in my WHOLE life)

After that scream I woke up on the floor near the gaming room with my friends around me, looking worried. As I got up I yelled at them ""DO YOU THINK IT WAS FUNNY TO SCARE ME LIKE THAT?""

One of my other friends lashed out ""SCARED YOU? YOU F**KEN SCARED US! WHAT THE HELL WERE YOU DOING?"" I looked confused... And I told what happened and they looked confused and freaked out.

This is what I was told by my friends. I came to the gaming room then stopped walking, my face went pale white and my face was stunned. I stood there for a good 10 seconds just to collapse on the floor...

What the hell happened here? If anyone could tell me, it would be great. I know ghost can cause illusions, but I'm just scared that it was a possession, if it was then I want to get my body cleansed.

Thanks for reading, I know it wasn't scary. But WEIRD INDEED.

The Bed Was Shaking,"Maryland, United States",Family / Friends Visits,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Family / Friends Visits :: The Bed Was Shaking

T his will be my first of many many stories that I will be entering on this site, every word I write is true and I have witnesses on MOST of the stories you may read from me. Now that I got that out of the way, I can begin...

It was late last August, (2007), my now fiance and I lived in separate cities... About an hour away from each other... So every chance I got to spend a night with him, or even see him for longer than an hour, I did. He told me he would be watching one of his co-workers homes for the week since he was going away on vacation, and the friend had some animals that needed EVERYDAY attention.

I was invited to spend the week there with him, so of course I accepted. Everything was fine on the first day. We chilled in the trailer and watched some tv, had a few beers and everything was good. Well the day went on and it was time to go to bed. Jamie was not tired but I was exhausted, I told him I was going to bed with or without him.

So in to the bedroom I went, as soon as I closed the door I got this strange feeling like someone was watching me, and since this persons trailer was in a bad neighborhood, I told Jamie so he would set the alarm and check all the windows and stuff. With that done I felt a little better, but not much. I laid down and started to fall asleep when the cat jumped on me, so now I am fully awake. I turned on the tv to try to bore myself to sleep.

Then, I would say like 5 minutes or so later, the bed started to shake VIOLENTLY! Jamie yelled into me to stop horsing around this wasn't our place and he didn't want me to accidentally break anything. I was so astonished I could not speak, the cat at this point had her claws dug in my shoulder and she huddled into my neck. Finally it really hit me that this was real, so I yelled for Jamie to ""come here right now""! I then heard a voice, as clearly as I could hear you if you were talking in a normal tone, and it said ""He is fine here, but you need to go... When he gets to the door he will see nothing!""

I was shocked and as soon as he touched the doorknob, (you know the jiggle noise they make?), the bed stopped. I wasn't really scared, I was just shocked and amazed, and what surprised me the most, Jamie said ""Was someone else in here with you? I heard another voice..."" (the tv volume was all the way down by the way...). I was so amazed, I told him what happened, and he, being my loving fiance, believed me. The cat was my proof, she still trembled terribly. After this he just watched tv in the room with me while I slept.

Well the second night the same thing happened... In the same detail, but instead of calling for Jamie I asked the ghost or whatever ""Why don't you want me here? I am a friend of Jordan's, (the owner), and I am only here helping to make sure this place doesn't get broke into... You are the one who should go, it's time to move on!"" and again I got this feeling that someone was sitting next to me staring at me.

I turned to look at the cat because she was now hissing at something, when I did I saw a woman in the mirror. Most people at this point, I think, would be out the door and down the street! She looked dead at me with a very hardened look, (like she was mad at me and I should not be there), then she smiled and pointed, I looked in the direction she was pointing and when I looked back she was gone. I got up and went over to see what she pointed at, and it was a picture of Jordan and the woman. I was just visited by his MOTHER! She died about a year before, and he was badly depressed when she died. I never said anything to Jamie about this because I didn't want him to upset Jordan, I just told Jordan that he has a guardian angel who is watching over him, and that loves and protects him more than he will ever know!

Ghost in the Bathroom,"Maryland, United States",Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: Ghost in the Bathroom

M y next story takes place at work... I work in a call center for the local cable company, which will remain nameless, and we outsource for our cleaning crew, or janitors. Most of them, with the exception of Catalina, do NOT speak English. They all wear the same thing, light blue shirts with black pants for the girls, and grey shirts with khakis, (yes, this is important).

Another important thing is our door to the bathroom is heavy! I am a big girl, and it's hard for me to push it open, especially when it gets stuck! It also makes this loud creaking noise when it opens and a hard loud bang when it shuts, (yes this is also important).

I had to use the potty before my shift, (as usual). I went into the bathroom and standing by the trash can was one of the cleaning girls, blue shirt black pants, it looked like Catalina, so I said ""hello!"", and went into a stall. I thought to myself it was odd for her to be changing a trash bag so early, (7:15ish), we had only been open since 6, there couldn't have been THAT MUCH trash. But whatever, I brushed it off.

I was washing my hands and notice that Cat was gone, maybe she is in the hall, (that leads to the bathroom exit), texting, she did this OFTEN! So when I got around the corner she was not there. Again, I simply brushed it off, maybe maintenance just fixed the door, and I didn't hear her leave.

But, when I opened the door there was the signature loud creak! ""OOOOOKAYYY"", I thought. I went to my desk and started to open my e-mails to get some cleared before I had to start the day. But this incident just bothered me. I started to ask around if anyone felt ""weird"" in the bathroom, like I always felt, but I just thought it was me.

Finally I asked one woman who has been here for 8 years, she told me ever since the ""accident"" she has seen an apparition and felt ""odd"" in/near or even thinking about using the bathroom here. I found this interesting, I asked her to tell me what happened, but she refused, (at this point I was pissed, why say anything if you're not going to tell me!).

About a week goes by and the eerie feeling is there, but nothing else. Then it happened again, saw her standing by the trash, then she vanished. Frustrated I went to my co-worker again, (her and I are pretty close, so I felt fine with what I did next), I looked at her and asked her to tell me about the accident again, and again she declined. So, I begged! I just pleaded until she caved, (took me like 20 minutes, but she loves me). This happened with Cat's TWIN sister, Anya.

Anya was cleaning up the water from a toilet that overflowed, as she exited a stall she slipped on a wad of toilet paper, fell back hit her head on the door, then the toilet, then lastly the floor. Amazingly enough she got up and said she was fine, (so everyone thought). She went to the hospital and they said she was fine. She went home to take a nap because she had a killer headache, and she never woke up. She had brain damage and hemorrhaging in her head, (can you say malpractice law-suit for the hospital!).

This happened about 4 years ago, and many people have seen Anya, but she never talks... I think she is stuck here, not aware that she died. I've attempted to contact her, but she doesn't seem to notice anyone at all. I've got strong medium abilities, and I don't think she can't hear me, but I think she just can't accept what happened to her, at least not right now...

Shadow Ghost With a Triangle Coming Out the Side of It,United Kingdom,Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: Shadow Ghost With a Triangle Coming Out the Side of It

T his first started when I was in middle school (11 years old approx) and carried on throughout secondary school. To get to my school from my house was about a 20 minutes walk - I would walk with my sister part the way and she would go to her secondary school whilst I carried on to my school.

Normally I would stick to the main roads which was lined with houses both sides but if running late there was a short cut through a very tiny bit of wood - the bit you had to cut through wasn't very dense and from where you entered it you could see the exit of it.

One day I was running late so cut through this part of the wood - the exit of the wood is up a slight hill so I got to the top of it and looked behind me (no particular reason and had no sudden urge to), 'standing' at the bottom of this slope/hill was a black figure, I would say human shaped but it had a triangle coming out the side of it, like a cloak was blowing and then had frozen whilst sticking out. I could see no features and it didn't move it just 'stood' there. I quickly carried on walking and didn't mention it to anyone.

The following weeks I kept walking this way trying to see if I could see it again (I had nicknamed it 'baby' for some reason) but didn't and soon forgot about it.

In my previous post I mention about hearing noises in my house and I now attribute these to 'Baby' as there were some appearances in my room (only a couple) and when I looked outside my window.

Occasionally I would look into a corner of my room and see a black hazy figure similar to babies - these came with no warning and didn't give me a chill or anything.

Also I would look outside my window and the path that runs alongside the house (I now don't live there) had a hedge the other side and I saw baby standing almost in the hedge. Again I had no warning of this and did not feel anything from it.

I did try to investigate if anything had happened in the woods and someone told me a woman had been murdered there but I don't believe this as there are no reports of it and there was no indication 'baby' was female.

I have since heard of shadow people and consider this as a possibility but I always thought shadow people were very active and moved about a lot - hence why they are often captured on cameras set up in empty rooms.

Since I moved house I have not seen baby again and still do not know if they were real apparitions or not - I think they were as it continued well into my teens (I moved at 15)

I have done ghost vigils in buildings and believe there are beings that cannot move on and do appear to us and there is no set in stone reason why this happens

I Mentally Called Out this Entity,"New York, United States",Apparitions / Voices / Touches,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Apparitions / Voices / Touches :: I Mentally Called Out this Entity

S o I was lying in bed the other night at about midnight. All my windows were closed and my door was shut. There are no drafts in my apartment. So when I heard the fluttering of papers on my desk and in the area of my cork board, my ears perked up a little bit. For some reason, this faint paper-shuffling sound sounded less organic than wind on a desk. The hairs on my left arm stood up a little and I felt a slight charge about my skin. I quickly assumed that there was something in my room with me moving about.

I was feeling a little brave and, due to a few past experiences, was beginning to think there might be something going on in this apartment. So, I mentally ""called out"" this supposed entity. In my head, I said, ""enough is enough, if you're so tough, then why don't you show yourself somehow? I'm sick of you flitting about. Either you're here or not, so why don't you..."" And just then I heard a deliberate tap on my doors. The doors to my room are French doors and each panel has a frosted glass piece in it. What I heard was a tap on this large piece of glass. Whenever my roommate knocks on my door, she taps the glass with her finger instead of rapping on wood like a normal door. This is exactly the sound I heard in the midst of telepathically challenging whatever I perceived to be in my room.

Because I heard what I believed to be a pretty obvious response to my challenge, I quickly back tracked and subjugated myself to the entity. In my head again, I apologized for questioning its presence and asked if it would please retreat and just let me sleep in peace. I experienced no further ""encounters"" that night.

So, my question is, do you guys think there was something there? Or was the fluttering of paper just coincidence? Was the tap on the glass in my door just the joint popping? Was it all in my head? What say ye?

I Want to Peacefully Try to Go Down those Stairs,Poland,Apparitions / Voices / Touches,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Apparitions / Voices / Touches :: I Want to Peacefully Try to Go Down those Stairs

T his happened to me here in poland a few months ago. It was on a saturday and I was coming down in my elevator to the front door to go out. (I live in a apartment complex). So I go out of the elevator and right next to me is this long flight of stairs. I'm about to touch the door when I hear the sound of footsteps going down the stairs. It sounded like sandals.

I turned around (I don't know why) to find no one was there. Now I have to say that it was 7 in the morning and where I live there's a bunch of old people and not many young people. Everybody sleeps this early on a saturday. Plus I heard footsteps going down I didn't imagine it. All I know is that when I turned around and saw no one there I just looked blankly at the stairs felt all creepy and then I don't know why, felt like I needed to get out of there quick.

So I ran out of the building. I never felt so scared. That isn't all really sometimes when I go down the stairs there I quickly go back up as if I'm really scared. I have tried to see if someone has died in my apartment complex but so far as I see I don't think anyone has.

Can someone help me here? I'm pretty lost and I want to peacefully try to go down those stairs. Also I don't want to look like a idiot in front of my friends again.

Do Not Disrespect the Spirits of the Ouija,"Maryland, United States",Ouija Board / Seances,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Ouija Board / Seances :: Do Not Disrespect the Spirits of the Ouija

I would like to give a little bit of my history, so to speak, for those of you who visit this site regularly. So you kind of get the feel for who I am, (psychically). I'm 22, from a very young age my mother knew I was ""Gifted"", (the next couple accounts are as told by my momma).

When I was about 4 I saw a girl on TV, (mom was watching the news), and I looked at my mom and started crying. She asked me what was wrong, and all I said was ""I can't believe she died!"". Now at this age, I had no perception of Life and Death, (that I recall). How could a 4 year old even know of such a thing. My mom finally calmed me down and asked me why I was so upset. I told her ""She used to be my daughter, and I just can't believe she is gone... She was so young and so smart"". My mom said at this point I started to cry again.

About an hour later we were at a local library. My mom found the woman's name who died, (we will call her Bee, and Bee's mother will be Sara...). She asked me what WAS my name before it was Stacey, and I replied without thinking, Sara... And I went about my B-I with Dr. Suess. She then asked where I lived, I told her I lived on a horse ranch in TX, then I went to college in MD and I still had horses here. Then I had a little girl, but it was over when she was 3. And now I'm Stacey. My mom says she then showed me a bunch of pictures, some of Sara, and some of random people, and she told me I pointed out Sara EVERY TIME! Strange!

Ok, on to the main story. Everyone says that you shouldn't mess with ouija's and they are bad. WRONG! Ouija's are not bad, but they are EASILY MISUSED! A lot of people don't have enough patience for an Ouija Board, so when they get frustrated they begin to mock or taunt the spirits. This is how most people end up with a demon or malicious spirit.

One of the key rules you should remember about Ouija is RESPECT. These spirits were once people, and deserve the same respect you or I deserve. Now, I have had many experiences using an Ouija Board, and only 1 of the resulted in a horrible accident. I had a friend over to use the board with me, and her fiance tagged along, he was very skeptical and didn't believe.

Well, he became frustrated with it because nothing was happening, and we were only at it for about 10 minutes. I told him to calm down and stop it. This is when things got rough. He started to mock the spirits and the board, he said (while still in the circle mind you), that this was a bunch of bull s**t and it's fake, and he told us we were stupid for believing in such a thing. Right then all the lights went off, (not like a power surgery, but the light switches got flipped down, like you would physically turn them off), even the lamp switches turned. I told him to stop saying those things and to have respect.

My friend, (not the rude boyfriend), suddenly felt ill, she was burning up but she complained she was freezing, she had her boyfriend take her home immediately. When she got home, she called me crying. She felt the spirit with her the whole way home, and when she arrived home her cat was in the middle of the road, he had been hit by a car. After she saw him she felt the spirit leave.

She will never let anyone close to her disrespect the spirits of the Ouija

An Illinois Haunting,"Illinois, United States",Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: An Illinois Haunting

M y story starts in 1983, the year I was born in Des Plaines, Illinois. My parents and my older brother had previously lived in a two-flat, but with a new baby, they decided they needed more space. House hunting was difficult for them, because money was tight, and they always seemed to get outbid on the property they wanted. When they pulled up to the house right off of the Wolf Rd. Circle, they thought it was too good to be true. It was a brick ranch, with wood floors, and all of the space our young family would need. There were schools within walking distance and a couple of parks too, they thought there was no way we would be able to place a successful bid on this one without a fight. It seems the property had been on the market for 7 years and no one had stayed there very long. My parents were ecstatic, and immediately placed a bid, and bought the house.

Everything was pretty normal, and no one seemed to notice anything odd, little noises were just the foundation settling, right? The day I was christened, my parents invited everyone over for a party, and to see the new house. We had moved in a month or two before so this was the first opportunity for the family to check it out. My aunt walked up the steps, and as soon as she set one foot in our entry way, not even saying hello, looked at my mother and said, ""I will not go in your basement, and will not go in your attic..."" My mom thought it was strange but just brushed it off.

While we were living in the house, things seemed to escalate. The kitchen was always about 20 degrees colder than the rest of the house, even on the hottest summer days. There were constant footsteps down the hallways that were noticeable because of the wood floors.

One day my Godmother and my mom were hanging out in the house and watching me. They heard the footsteps coming down the hallway, and me being a one year old heard them too. You could follow where they were coming from, and as soon as they approached where the doorway was I started screaming and crying at the top of my lungs. Needless to say, they picked me up and ran out of the house as quickly as they could. We didn't go back until my dad was home from work. Another weird thing that occurred regularly was that we had storm windows in the basement that had shutters on the basement walls that were locked from the inside. There was no wind that would come from the window wells, but they would bang at random times.

Everyone in my immediate family was injured while living in the house. My brother, who was 8-9 at the time was playing on our living room floor, when out of nowhere my mom hears a scream. She walks in to find the fireplace mantle on top of him. He of course couldn't have pryed it off the wall, and it was about 15 feet away from the fireplace. He said it flew off the wall onto him. My dad was hanging up artwork in a hallway one day, and said the hammer flew back and hit him above the eye. He had to go to the hospital and still has 2 scars above his eye from where the sharp points on the opposite end of the hammer hit him. My mom also said an unseen force pushed her off the deck and she broke her wrist.

I was the only one to see the ghost, but I cannot recall anything, even though this is my very first childhood memory. I was about 3 at the time and my dad asked me to get him a pop from the fridge. I remember mundane details like the socks he was wearing and my point-of-view while walking down the hallway. I reached the fridge, grabbed a pop, and turned around to head back to the other room. When I did, I screamed and that's all I remember. My parents found me lying on the kitchen floor, and when they woke me I didn't remember what happened. I'm 25 years old now, and I try to remember, but I still can't. I've thought about going to a hypnotist to bring the memory back, but I'm too afraid.

My parents had been in the house a while now, and got friendly with the neighbors. After a while they started asking about the house and our experiences with it. They then mentioned that they knew the house wasn't ""right"". It had been vacant for a long time, and whenever anyone moved in, they wouldn't last too long. They told my parents that an older couple had lived there and the husband was a salesman that would travel frequently. His wife, Pearl, had some medical ailment and was confined to a wheelchair. One time when the husband went out of town, Pearl died in the kitchen and no one knew until the husband came home a week or two later. The husband must have known that even after death, Pearl stayed in the house because even though he moved out, he paid for the house to be kept up and the heating and air conditioning to run for the 7 years it was vacant.

My mom went to a psychic around this time with some girlfriends, and they all had a reading. After she was done giving my mom a reading about life children, job, future, etc. She said, ""I know you didn't come here to find out about this, you really want to know who is in your house..."" Finally, someone offered to help. She told my mom to go back into the house and tell Pearl that she was welcome to stay if she would leave us alone, but if she wanted to cause trouble she would have to leave. After that my mom had the house blessed, and nothing happened again. We lived there another 2 years before we moved.

I live in a suburb about 40 minutes away now, but every time I pass that house I always wonder if she is still there.

My Vivid Dreams,"Florida, United States",Family / Friends Visits,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Family / Friends Visits :: My Vivid Dreams

W hen I was a kid, during the school summer holidays when my parents were working, myself and my 2 brothers would stay with my grandparents. We loved it there, my grandparents had a wonderful house with a beautiful garden, they were very loving and every day was filled with new exciting adventures. We were a very close family.

When I was around 10 or 11 years old my granddad had a heart attack. When he was in hospital my parents felt I was too young to visit him, then he died a few days later. Again, my parents felt I was too young to go to the funeral. This was heart breaking to me, I never got the chance to say goodbye, I loved my granddad with my whole heart.

My relationship with my Granny stayed the same, very close. At the age of 18 I left Scotland to go traveling and finally settled in Florida, where I am still living today at the age of 28. I am still close to my family, but obviously not as much so.

Last year I returned to Scotland as my granny found out she had cancer and only had a few months left. It was a very emotional and sad visit but every moment was special and precious. After the funeral I returned to Florida.

Once I returned I started having dreams, very vivid, almost real.

The first one, I was sitting in my granny's living room with her and she told me that she was upset about the damp patch above the window.

I called my mum in scotland and told her about the dream. (During this time my granny's house was being emptied as it was being sold.) My mum went to the house, removed the curtains and to her surprise found a damp patch which had not been seen before!

The next dream, my granny came to me and told me that she had forgot to leave something special for my dad (her son) she had left special items for her other children but had forgotten him. She told me to tell him to go into a specific drawer, and a special book would be in there for him to keep. I again called home, told my mum who told my dad, they both went to my granny's house, looked in the drawer and found a very special book. Later on, when the will was read, every child of my granny's was left something special except my dad!

The next few dreams my granny told me about specific items in the house which had been overlooked or lost that she wanted retrieved, she would tell me exactly where they were. I would call my parents and low and behold they would be there! The dreams went on for a few weeks, it was as if my gran was using me to help her finish of her business.

The last dream was amazing. I was standing outside my granny's house and my granddad walked out the front door. He walked to me and told me that he loved me, he missed me and was looking over me. I told him that I missed him and that I was so sorry I never said goodbye. He gave me a big hug and I could feel on my cheek the bristles of his sweater on my cheek, I said again that I loved him and he told me that he loved me to. Then I woke up. Tears were streaming down my face - it was so emotional, vivid and real I could still feel where the sweater bristles had rubbed my cheek!

Since then I have had no dreams about my granny or granddad! But I am glad that I was of help to them after their passing.

Hallway Haunts,"North Carolina, United States",Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: Hallway Haunts

A ccording to my landlord, the house I live in was constructed around the time of the Civil War. At the time it served as barracks, and later as a hotel, and today it is split into four separate apartments. We live in the top left one, if you are facing the house.

I have tried researching this house as there are many historic houses in this old town, but I couldn't find anything in the library about it, which is quite unusual as I found just about every other house in Oxford there. I even found houses that aren't that old!

The closest I got was the next door neighbors, and I could see a portion of our front porch. I think something happened here or on the property, that Oxford wants to be kept secret. I know me and some sensitive friends of mine have the distinct feeling that there is a very large tree missing from the yard. It is the south, and I wonder if it was a hanging tree that could have been burned down during the race riots here.

We moved in Sept. 11, 2001. That in itself should have been a sign this is an extraordinary place. Considering the age of the place, I figured it would have its haunts.

It wasn't until well after we had settled in, I'd say the following spring, was the first evidence that there was something else living here. I was home alone, completely alone, as in nobody was in the whole building, and relaxing on the sofa in the living room reading. Suddenly I heard the sound of footsteps walking toward me in the hall. (The hall runs past all the bedrooms railroad style, and ends in the living room. The kitchen, laundry room, and back door is at the other end.) I sat up in preparation thinking my sweetie was off work early.

Then as they neared something struck me odd. I realized what I was hearing was the sound of men's dress shoes, or even boots on hard wood, and the hall is carpeted. The sound carried the whole way to the end, stopped and then turned around and went to the kitchen and stopped. I took a look and of course nobody was there, but I still heard it as I looked. That phenomenon happened a few times here and there and then ceased. And it would happen differently every time. Sometimes it would stop at the living room, sometimes it would stop halfway down the hall.

Something that happened recently involving that same hallway happened in August. It happened while my cat Muffin was still alive. I was once again laying on the couch reading, Jeff was behind me at his computer as usual. Suddenly, all three of my cats came tearing into the living room like their tails were on fire! They all three jumped to the back of the couch, where sometimes they would sleep in a line, and I laughed at them. I asked ""What are you doing silly kitties?!"" At the same time, all three of them looked into the hallway. I looked and I distinctly saw a shadow person. It was the upper left part of him, and he was reaching out to the wall as if to stop himself from running, and then he ducked back out of my view. My hair stood on end! Jeff went to the back of the house to check for me as I was a little freaked, and the back door was still locked.

Another phenomenon that happened after some now ex-friends moved out of the apartment across the hall, (they were bad tenants and friends) and a new set of friends moved in, Jamie and Robert. After they moved in, we would each have our doorbells ring at the same time, and sometimes separately, but no one was ever there. There was one time, that scared the crap out of me, the doorbell rang, and Jamie was there! I had opened the door expecting to see nobody, and there she was, asking if I had just banged on her door. Sometimes you expect the paranormal and it is the normal that ends up scaring ya'! This door activity would occur anywhere form midnight to three in the morning. There came a point when I just took my doorbell down because of the annoyance. But when I did that I would hear knocking at the same time every night.

One night, I was a little tipsy, and the knocking came, three times as usual. Well the verse in the bible about Jesus knocking three times came to mind, and I opened the door and said, ""Come on in Jesus!"" The knocking ceased for a month. Then it started again, but when it did I was sleeping. I ran to the door thinking it was my sister and there was something wrong, for some reason. As usual there was an empty hall. I yelled into the hall, ""Stop it already! It isn't cute anymore!"" I slammed the door shut. It hasn't again happened since.

After that, everyone who comes to visit mentions having a really bad feeling in the hall. One of my friends makes me escort her halfway down the stairs when she comes to visit me. I don't always get the feeling, but I do feel the tension sometimes.

A month or so later something wicked happened. I was headed out the door, I can't remember where I was going. I got a really bad feeling. I looked into the open door of my landlord's apartment, and thought the bad vibe had something to do with him. But in retrospect I think it was whatever is in that hall! As I was slowly going down the stairs, and holding onto the railing, looking into the apartment, I felt a hand shove me down the four remaining steps. It shoved me hard enough for me to lose my grasp on the railing! I uncontrollably stumbled to the bottom and my hand went through the window at the end of the steps. I got a nasty cut that needed stitches on the base of my hand onto my wrist. The cut is ironically in the shape of an S, and conveniently dodged a major vein and artery! It was deep enough to sever these!

I yelled at the spirit in the hall that if it ever pulled a stunt like that again I would have it exorcised so fast it would make its head spin! Nothing like that happened again, but sometimes going down those steps I feel like someone is behind me wanting to push me down! It is a really nasty feeling when you can feel that spirit. I don't blame anyone who would want an escort out of the building with that thing there!

I still live in this old apartment, and have had a couple other experiences in it, as well as in my friends' apartment across the hall. But I will post it later!

My Father's Unrest,"California, United States",Family / Friends Visits,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Family / Friends Visits :: My Father's Unrest

M y mother comes from a country where even until today things are still old fashioned and secluded from the city. All her life she has been followed by occurrences, experiences, sightings that cannot be explained. She is not a stranger to seeing ghosts, entities. But this is by far one experience I as well as she will never forget.

My father was not a very good man while he lived on this earth. My mother had more painful memories of him than good. I had no recollection of him until I met him when I was about 8 years old. He was a stranger to me. A stranger who had brought pain and suffering to my mothers life.

It was when I was 10 years old that he decided to take his own life in a violent way. It was within that week of learning of his death and attending his funeral that I noticed strange things started happening. My mother seemed more afraid than in mourning. I remember her telling one of my aunts about the plants she had out on the back porch. She was accustomed to leaving a glass of water out for the recently deceased. I still do not understand the meaning behind that. She left that glass of water by her plants on the back porch. The next morning all the plants had been torn to pieces as if they were ripped by hand from the pots and the water was just spilled.

My aunt then told my mother she had heard a voice whisper in her ear ""it's not worth it,"" while she sat at her dining table mourning the death of my father. Since the suicide of my father, my mother had this uneasiness about her. It wasn't until I got older that my mother told me most of the things that she had experienced.

For years she had been followed and tormented by what she solemnly believed was my fathers unresting ghost. She told me how she clearly felt she was being watched at night. When she was sleeping she would suddenly smell the stench of men's cologne and someone laying next to her in bed but never had the courage to turn around. When she would bathe she felt someone was outside looking through the window.

Another time she got out of the shower crying and completely horrified. She told me something has struck her clear across her back. I looked at her back and there was a red mark on her back. It almost seemed in the shape of a letter to me but I was in such disbelief I did not know what to say to her.

My mother would tell me she knew when my fathers ghost would go in her room. She could hear the train every night at about the same time. Shortly after the train the stench of cigar and cologne would fill her room. After seeing my mother in such pain and complete fright. I stayed up one night. I remember hearing the train from a distance. I went outside and started speaking to the man I had only met once in my life and never called father. I asked him to leave. Leave in peace and bring my mother peace. As I said this I could not help but feel a horrible rage. I was so angry. I asked him to rest.

About a week later I noticed a change in my mother. She was less reluctant to be alone, go to sleep. I asked her if she was alright. Then she told me. One night while she was sleeping she had heard the voice of my father ask for her forgiveness. My mother woke up looked around and said, ""I forgive you..."" It was at that moment that she knew my fathers unresting soul had found peace.

My Grandma's Spirit Is our Daily Visitor,"Texas, United States",Family / Friends Visits,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Family / Friends Visits :: My Grandma's Spirit Is our Daily Visitor

I 've always been fascinated with ghosts. I was the little girl who was intrigued by a good ghost story and asked questions afterward, putting myself in the spirit's situation. I'm very understanding and try to see any situation from both perspectives. So yes, I believe in ghost. Yet, how ironic when my grandma passed away, the thought of my grandma's house being haunted was hard to accept.

My two aunts, Delia and Chuy, lived with my grandma to take care of her. My grandma passed away in January 2005. She had Alzheimer's disease so my family was prepared. I was at ease when she died because I knew she wouldn't suffer anymore. She could now rest in peace: so we thought.

My family's first experience was a day after my grandma died. I wasn't there when this occurred. Aunt Delia, Chuy, Uncle Lupe, and my mom (my grandma's children) were at my grandma's house making funeral arrangements. My mom was in my Aunt Delia's room calling the funeral home. Aunt Delia, Chuy and Uncle Lupe were sitting on the couch in the living room. They could hear my mom talking over the arrangements when they heard footsteps in the hallway. My grandma's hallway has wooden floors so the footsteps were loud and clear. They said it sounded as if someone was walking in the hallway and going towards the kitchen. No one wanted to go and check, for it was only them and my mom who were in the house.

I first noticed something odd weeks after the funeral. I was at the dining table eating. I can't recall where Aunt Delia and Chuy were (they still live at my grandma's house). So I was eating and just getting use to not seeing my grandma, physically, in her house anymore. The house was quiet without her there. I was lost in thought when I saw someone standing in the middle of the hallway looking at me from my peripheral vision. *Note: If you were to sit at the end of the table and look straight ahead you can see the hallway and any one standing there.* Whoever I saw were dressed in white. I couldn't get a good look at whoever it was, because when I faced their direction; they were gone! I turned away for a split second and the white figure was there in the hallway again! I looked and it was gone as fast as it disappeared. I was puzzled. Then when I looked away for the third time, in my peripheral vision, nothing was there. The hallway was empty. So something WAS there.

This hallway event happened numerous times. Sometimes the white figure would be at the entrance of the hallway, middle, or at the very end. So this figure could move about as it chose.

Another incident occurred in the living room. I was bored. I didn't want to watch TV or be on the computer. So I decided to sit down and rest. I was sitting at the very end of the couch when in the corner of my eye I saw a white figure sitting at the other end (of the couch). From what I interpreted this figure didn't seem to know I was just a few feet away; it never looked in my direction. I couldn't tell if it was a male or female. I could make out a dress so I guess it was a female. I quickly turned towards the other end of the couch and the figure was gone. Just like the hallway incident. I returned to whatever I was doing when out of the corner of my eye... The figure reappeared and their legs were crossed. I freaked out and walked out of the living room. Fast! Even when I got up and walked out, passing the couch I was sitting on, the figure was still sitting there. I got out of there ASAP!

The hallway and the couch incident would happen almost everyday. But then it slowed down. There would be times when I didn't see the white figure for weeks or a good month, but then it would start all over again. It was as if the figure could come and go my grandma's house any time it wanted to. But those weren't the only incidents happening at my grandma's house.

My mom and her sisters (Delia and Chuy) went to Wal-Mart but I decided to stay at my grandma's house. I was tired and wasn't in the mood to go out. As they left I locked the front door and headed to the bathroom. *Note: The bathroom is located next to the kitchen.*

I was doing my business when I heard voices talking. I couldn't make out what they were saying but it came from the kitchen. I thought my mom had forgotten something in the house so she came back to get it. But the conversation I heard was between two people. As I stepped out of the bathroom I said ""Mom your back?"" Silence. I looked in the kitchen only to find no one was there. I walked to the front door. It was locked, just as I had left it. I looked out the window, my mom's SUV wasn't in the drive way. I was spooked. I know I heard voices but I shrugged it off and went to my Uncle John's room, by the dining area, watched TV and waited for my mom to get back.

On other occasions I would hear my name being called. I would ask Chuy or Aunt Delia if they called me. They both answered 'no'. But then again I've always heard my name being called, even when I was a child. So I was use to this.

I would also see a shadow figure passing by the doorway of my grandma's room or in the hallway. I would look and no one would be there.

The same goes for the knocking on the front and back door. I would hear knocking on the front door but when I open to greet whoever it is... No one was there.

A year had passed and these events still were occurring. I thought I was going crazy! Why was I the only one seeing these phenomenons? My worries came to rest during a family gathering at my grandma's house.

In November 2006 on a Monday we had a small gathering. I was talking to my mom, Chuy, and my cousin, Yvette (Uncle Lupe's daughter), if they have ever heard or seen anything. Yvette was staying at my grandma's house for a couple of nights (at the time) and she told us that at night she hears noises and footsteps in the hall. After she said that we all looked at each other and we started to talk about our own experiences. My mom mentioned that on Friday (10-6-06) she saw someone in white standing in the hallway. She couldn't make out a face, but knew it was a person. Then Chuy said often when she was washing dishes or doing laundry, she saw a shadow, in the corner of her eye, passing by in the hall. Wow! So I'm not the only one who's seeing/hearing things at my grandma's house. So then it was my turn. I confessed that sometimes when I stay alone in the house I hear voices or someone calling my name. I also sometimes see a shadow passing by in the hallway and footsteps. Then all of us confessed that sometimes when we sit down at the couch, we see someone dressed in white sitting on the other end. We then talked about the knocking on the door. After each of us confessed our weird experiences we all looked at each other and said ""THIS HOUSE IS HAUNTED!"" It was creepy and funny at the same time.

I felt relieved that I wasn't the only one seeing the white figure in the hallway and on the couch. And my mom, Chuy, and Yvette felt better talking about what they've seen. *Laughs to self* I then told my cousin ""Sucks for you because you're spending the night here again...""

So we concluded that ""something"" was at my grandma's house. We also concluded that it was my grandma who was the white figure we were seeing. I guess she's just checking on us and letting us know she's watching over us.

I had doubts though. Although I am a big believer in ghosts, when it came down to my grandma's house, a house I'm very close to, it was hard to accept. I was used to hearing and watching ghost stories on TV but never thought I would experience an actual haunting. But then reality sank in and I asked myself ""It can't be all in my head because I'm not the only one who has seen things. Chuy and even Aunt Delia said they've seen shadows walk by doorways. And the whole Hallway and Couch incidents... Those really did happen..."" I guess we all at one point had doubts but it wasn't until someone else, not a member of the family, had an experience.

Another year had passed. Around spring 2007 my boyfriend, Vince, had come over to my grandma's house to eat. Chuy had made some food. I had told Vince about my grandma's house and that it was haunted. He was interested because he too had seen some pretty creepy unexplainable things at his cousin's house when he was young. But that day the idea of my grandma's house being haunted escaped his mind. I made him sit down at the end of the kitchen table on purpose. I ate quietly and didn't mention anything like ""look into the hallway"" or ""do you see anything?"" I waited until we were at my house. In my room we started talking about school. We were high school seniors so we were counting down the days. I then asked him if he had seen anything at my grandma's house. I was surprised at his response. ""Yes!"" He told me he would see a dark shadow in the hallway and every time he looked it was getting closer and closer. It was unsettling to him so he just looked away. When he looked back into the hallway the shadow was gone.

He also told me he knew something was in the hallway because it would disappear and then reappear. I was excited that Vince saw something; Vince was still a bit creeped out. What puzzled me was the fact it was ""dark"" instead of ""white"". Vince concluded that if it was my grandma, since she knows my family, she appears white to us, but because she doesn't know him, she appeared dark as in trying to say What are you doing in my house?

Vince had another encounter with my grandma in May 2007, a few months after his previous sighting. It was Memorial Day and my friends and I were going to the Island (South Padre Island. It's about 30 minutes from where we live so we can come and go as we wish). My friend, Becky, was going to pick me and Vince up at my grandma's house since she lives close by. While we were waiting for Becky in the living room, I went to the kitchen to get water for the short trip, leaving Vince alone on the couch. He had just gotten out of bed and was still waking up. When I came back into the living room Vince looked confused. I sat next to him and asked what's wrong. He told me he saw someone in white on the other end of the couch. I was shocked. It had been a while since I've seen the white figure, then all of a sudden Vince sees it. He also told me he thought it was me, but when he saw me coming from the kitchen... Then who was on the couch next to him? He also said the figure looked as if it was staring at him to see how he was. I laughed and reassured him that it was my grandma and that it's good that she appeared to him in ""white"" instead of ""dark"". That must mean she likes him.

As of today, my grandma's house still has a few strange unexplainable experiences happen. I have yet to see my grandma fully appear before us but my family concludes that the white figure we see is indeed my grandma. But because there'll be months when nothing happens and then we'll see something a few days later, but then it'll be quiet for another good few months... We also conclude that my grandma pays us visits every so often, letting us know she's watching over us and her house.

The House on Kimberly St,"North Carolina, United States",Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: The House on Kimberly St

W hen I was in the 5th grade my family and I moved into a nice house in a nice neighborhood in Mount Airy, NC. All of the neighbors were very friendly and there were a lot of other kids for me and my 2 younger sisters to play with. About 2 months after we moved in we started finding bobby pins through out the house. Bobby pins don't sound scary, but when no one in the house uses them, you wonder where they are coming from. We would find them in the beds at night after my mom had changed the sheets and everything.

Things started getting scary for me about 3 months after we moved in. The entrance to the attic was in my closet and as I lay in bed at night, I would hear scratching noises that sounded like they were coming from the ceiling. I would call my parents in there and my dad assured me that it was just a squirrel or something that had gotten stuck up there.

When we would wake up in the mornings, my sisters and I would get in trouble for leaving the refrigerator door or cabinet doors open. The only problem was that none of us had gotten up in the night to leave them open. The radio in the living room would cut on by itself, normally when one of us kids were in the house by ourselves.

The incident that finally changed my parents way of thinking came one Halloween night (I know it sounds cliche). My sisters and I were all out trick or treating with our friends and my parents were there handing out candy to the kids. The front door led into the living room and then there was a side door that led into the kitchen. There was a bar that separated the kitchen from the living room. Anyway, the front door was open and the side door was shut and locked. At about 8:30 pm, the door to the kitchen opened up and in walked our cat. Both of my parents looked at each other and one went out the front door and the other out the side door. They met around the back of the house to find no one there.

The next day, they asked our neighbor who had the spare key to the house how that was a funny trick she had played on them. She had no idea what they were talking about because she had been out of town since the morning before and had just gotten home. Needless to say, we moved about a month later and I have never been back to that house.

It does not seem like a scary thing now, but it was frightening when you are 11 years old. Thank you for taking the time to read this and if anyone knows about this house please get in touch with me. I have always wanted to know if others had some of the same incidents we had when we lived there.

Was it a Ghost or a Dream?,"New Jersey, United States",Apparitions / Voices / Touches,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Apparitions / Voices / Touches :: Was it a Ghost or a Dream?

T his story happened to my wife when we were living in a apartment complex in Maple Shade, New Jersey. One evening she reluctantly tells me of what happened to her the night before only because she really had no explanation for it herself.

In the middle of the night she says she had a very vivid dream as if she was witnessing someone's entire life through their eyes. An older Italian gentlemen's life was being seen like a photo album flipping its pages. Everything of importance in ones life, first communion, graduations, first kisses, marriage, birth of kids, and deaths all were being felt and seen in my fiance's mind all through the classic song of ""sea of Love"". At the end a voice tells my wife ""I know she is very sick"" Who or what he's talking about, my wife nor I have any idea.

She did wake up only to the faint smell of a cigar smoke. On the very rare occasion I might smoke a cigar, NEVER had I done it in the apartment.

Now it's a small street level, one bedroom apartment, so as you walk out the bedroom the bathroom is to the left and the living room/dining room is to the right. At night there is a lamp post outside my apartment that shines through the separations of the living room curtain and blinds and it reflects on one of our living room walls which you can notice as soon as you walk into the living room from the bedroom.

As she walked out of the bedroom she said she saw a silhouette of a man by the wall where the light was being reflected. But the strange thing is that she felt the shadow she saw was on the wall itself, it was not being reflected from an outside source. Being that she couldn't believe what she was seeing she turned her head towards the living room window just to make sure no peeping toms were out there which she couldn't tell but when she turned back towards the shadowy figure, he was gone. She ran to the window and open the curtains and no one was there.

Nobody was standing by the window. To cast the shadow she saw the person would have had to be leaning on the window let alone pretty much be in the apartment. That has never happened again.

Later on we started thinking of who could have visited when we came across her best friend's grandmother in-law (Helen) passed away later that summer. She had been very sick for a while and her son (my wife's best friend's father in law) had been taking care of his mother until she passed.

Helen's husband passed a while ago and we have never seen pictures of him so we don't really know if it was him? We could be reaching with that one.

My wife also gets visits in her dreams from her grandmother who passed away in 2003. I believe in the paranormal but I have never heard of anything like this. Asking for any explanation or any similar experiences so I can explain it to my wife.

A Message on the Car Radio,Ireland,Family / Friends Visits,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Family / Friends Visits :: A Message on the Car Radio

T his story is in two parts; the first part took place in New York City shortly after my boyfriend died. Of course I was devastated when this happened. He was to be buried in his native Ireland, but on the day of his funeral in Ireland they had a memorial Mass for him at his parish in Queens. My boyfriend always liked to hear me sing for him (I had done some singing around NYC at the time), so I impulsively volunteered to sing at his memorial Mass. The piece that I chose to sing was the ""Pie Jesu"" from Gabriel Faure's Requiem.

The morning of the memorial Mass I tried to warm up my voice in my apartment, but every time I got to the words, ""dona eis requiem,"" I burst into tears. I didn't know how I'd get through singing at the Mass (I was scheduled to sing during Communion). But it was too late to back out. All the way up to the time I walked up onto the altar to sing my piece I was praying, ""Please help me get through this. Don't let me let Jim down..."" And then my Moment of Truth arrived. Standing in the sanctuary next to the organ, I nodded to the organist and he played the sustained, one-chord introduction. I started to sing, and as I did so, I felt a presence with me, urging me on, ""You can do this for Jim... "" Whoever this unseen spiritual supporter was, he/she helped me get through the piece without breaking down in front of the congregation. As I finished the piece I walked off the altar, collapsed into a convenient pew, and gave vent to my pent-up tears.

Fast forward to about two weeks ago. I was touring around Ireland with a friend, and seeing as we were our own tour guides, we followed our own itinerary. Needless to say, one of our stops was to visit the graveyard where my boyfriend Jim is buried. We had been there before, so there was not much trouble finding it again. My friend left me alone as I knelt and prayed over Jim's grave, and yes, even all this time later I shed some tears -- we loved each other very much. And then I got back in the car, and my friend and I continued on our way.

My friend and I discovered a nice Classical music station on the car radio which we played when my friend (who did all the driving, bless her) felt she wouldn't be distracted by the music if she was trying to find the right road to get us to our next destination. So, we were comfortably on the road again, and we decided to turn the radio on. About the second or third piece they played after we turned the radio on was the ""Pie Jesu"" from Faure's Requiem. I gasped when I heard it come on. My friend (who attended Jim's memorial Mass in Queens) took her eyes off the road long enough to meet mine. ""I don't think that's a coincidence,"" she said. ""They don't play pieces like that very often on the radio. I think this is Jim's way of telling you he knows about your visiting his grave earlier today..."" I shed a few more tears, thinking of Jim, but felt comforted that he knew I said an ""Ave"" for him, and that is grave is ""warmer, sweeter"" for it...

Little Girl and the Ball of Light,"Texas, United States",Apparitions / Voices / Touches,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Apparitions / Voices / Touches :: Little Girl and the Ball of Light

W hen I was a kid my best friends older brother would baby-sit us when my parents went out, we would watch terminator to give you an idea how long ago this was. It was typical for me to pass out on the couch.

One particular night I woke up in the middle of the night. I sat up and looked over the back of the couch into the dining room to see if I could catch a glimpse of what time it was. To my surprise there was a little girl sitting at the far end of the table. She looked to be about 7 years old, she was wearing a dress and she has this green ambience to her. I wanted to talk to her because she was just sitting there staring off into space, she didn't seem to notice me looking at her.

I couldn't muster up the courage to talk to her so I laid back down on and tried to go back to sleep. About an hour later I looked up over the couch again and she was in a different chair, this time facing my direction but her head was down looking at something on the table. I watched silently to see if she would do something, she sat there for a long time, then eventually got up and walked through the wall into the backyard. Once she was gone I turned on the lights and investigated the area she had been in. The room was a lot colder than the living room, but other than that, there was no sign of her doing anything in particular. I went back to sleep and that was the last time I saw her.

The only other incident was when me and the neighbor kids were camping out in my backyard on our trampoline, we had a ton of blankets and pillows out there and were just goofing off late at night. We had 2 really large oak trees in the back yard, one had a bee hive in the trunk and someone had cemented the holes shut in what I assume was an attempt to trap them in. We would always mess with the hive for fun, we were dumb kids you know? We always threw rocks in the hole or did something to taunt the bees, then wed go running off to get away from them, it was our form of entertainment.

Well while we were all sitting on the trampoline telling jokes and what not, we heard a loud boom, and a bright ball of light shot out from the tree up in the sky, zoomed back around way above us then came slamming back down into the tree. It scared the crap out of us at first, and we stayed up all night to see if it would happen again.

To our disappointment nothing happened at all. The weird thing is there is a knot in the side of the tree that looks like a human skull, its probably just a coincidence but it was our outlet for imagining what it could have been.

I'm not sure if anyone else has seen anything like this, I almost forgot about it until I found this site. I'm not a believer of orbs being anything significant because those who claim to have taken photos of them, don't seem to be trying to photograph them in the first place, so I come to the conclusion that its just a light refraction in the lens of the camera.

This incident was different though, I'm not sure I want to call it an orb, it was a bright ball of light that seemed to move around sporadically and it was loud and bright. Any ideas? This all happened before the mommy ego stuff.

Little Girl in my House,"Louisiana, United States",Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: Little Girl in my House

L et me start by saying that I grew up in New Orleans, LA... And from living there for all those years, I can tell you that there isn't much I haven't seen. When I was 13 years old, my father, my brother, my grandmother, and I moved out of the apartment we were living in, and into a house on the outskirts of the city. It was a nice house and I liked it a lot, but at times things would happen that would scare me. The first thing we noticed about the house was that the front porch and the entrance to the front door was like a big ramp... Like it was designed for someone with a wheelchair.

It must have been about a week after we moved in, it was during the end of summer, around August, and in the summer I get bad allergies and hay fever. So I had gotten sick that day, and I went to bed early, around 6 o'clock in the evening. My father had gone out, so had my grandmother, and my little brother was staying at a friend's house back in our old neighborhood. So I was alone, which didn't bother me because I like being alone.

So, it must have been around 9 or 10 at night when I heard this loud banging noise. It woke me up abruptly, and it kind of scared me. So I get up out of my bed and walk around the house looking for what's making that noise. As I walk into the kitchen, I can tell that the noise is coming from outside. Our kitchen faced our backyard, so as I looked out the window I could see the whole yard. Off in the corner of the yard we had this old aluminum sided shed. Now, it was pretty dark out there, and I was half asleep, and sick and tired, and just flat out disorientated. But I was absolutely positive of what I was looking at. It was a little girl. She had her back to me and she was banging on the shed as hard as she could. She was wearing a little dress with big polka dots and there was this big bow tie on the back of her dress. And she had pigtails in her hair.

Well, I couldn't help but to laugh at this. I figured that since we were new in the neighborhood, some of the neighborhood kids were just messing with us. So, I just blew it off and went back to bed. I never thought of it again and never mentioned it to any one.

Then, about a month or two after that... School had started, and I was in bed asleep because it was a school night. My little brother comes running into my room and jumps on my bed with me. Now, you have to understand something... I have never known my brother to be scared of anything. He fears NOTHING. So when I saw him freaked out like that, on my bed shaking and crying, I was scared to death.

I asked him what happened, and at first he couldn't even talk. I just sat there and held him until he calmed down, and then he finally told me. He said that he had woken up to use the bathroom. As he got out of his bed, he said he felt really cold, and he just felt weird... Like someone was watching him. So he turned on his little lamp and he looked around his room and he saw a little girl standing in the corner of his room staring at him. He said that her face was all messed up, like someone had beat her with a bat. Half of her face was all smashed in. And she was wearing a polka dot dress, and the dress was all muddy and torn, and she was just STARING at him!

Well, when he told me that, I was definitely freaked out. That had to have been the same girl I saw that night, but I never thought that she was a ghost or anything. I thought she was a regular girl.

Needless to say, my brother and I decided to keep that to ourselves. We didn't want to tell anyone because we were scared that they would make fun of us. But it seems like the more we tried to pretend it didn't happen... The more she would mess with us. And it wasn't just her. There was someone else there, too. I could never see him, but I could always hear his wheelchair late at night, and I could hear him grunting in frustration... Like he was trying to get out of his wheelchair or something. All sorts of little things would happen. I'd be watching TV in the living room and I'd hear a little girl whisper something and I'd hear little feet running across the kitchen floor.

One time I was in the shower, and I was home alone, so I left the bathroom door open. Out of no where, the lights in the bathroom went out and the door slammed shut! I was so freaked out, I didn't know what to do.

And things didn't just happen to me and my brother. I had friends that would be at my house and tell me things, too. My friend Eric spent the night at my house one night and he was sleeping on the floor next to my bed. He said that something kept touching his face, and when he opened his eyes to see it, it was a little hand... Like the hand of a child coming out from under my bed. Yeah, after that I didn't sleep in my room for a while.

But what I thought was odd, was that she never messed with my grandmother. Or if she did, my grandmother just never mentioned it. She never really messed with my father either, except for one night. I had a couple of friends over and we were watching TV in the living room. My father had to work the next day so he was in his room sleeping. Well, out of no where, he comes running out into the living room yelling at me, and I was like, ""Dad, what's your problem, why are you screaming at me..."" And he told me to stay out of his room and leave him alone while he's sleeping because he's tired and has to get up early. I was a bit confused.

The next day I asked him why he did that. He said that he was sleeping and he felt someone breathing on him, so he turned to look, but it was so dark, all he could see was a dark figure and it kicked his bed and ran out of the room. He assumed it was me playing around with him. But I knew who it was and it made the hair on the back of my neck stand straight up when he told me that.

That's pretty much it for that. I never saw the girl again, but you didn't have to see her to know that she was there. She obviously loved attention and would try to get it from whoever was around. And as for the wheelchair man... I asked some people in my neighborhood about that. They told me that some old guy used to live there by himself and yes, he was in a wheelchair. I asked some of them if he had a granddaughter or if ever there was a little girl that lived there, and they said no, they never saw any girl there. But they found that question odd because there was a little girl that lived in that neighborhood years ago that went missing. Some people believed that the old man that was in the wheelchair had lured her in the house and... well, who knows. They said that the police investigated the missing girl, but she was never found. The old man lived in the house by himself and he was supposedly kind of weird, so they questioned him without any probable cause and he filed a complaint against them and that was the end of that.

I never knew what the think about all this. I even contemplated digging around in the backyard, maybe around the shed to see if her body was buried there. I didn't know what to believe, so I decided to just forget about it. And on the day we moved out... A few years later, I think I was 16, all of our stuff was out of the house, and I was so exhausted from moving the stuff all day that I fell asleep on the floor in what used to be my bedroom. I had a dream of a little girl trying to talk to me. I couldn't see her, and I could barely make out what she was saying. But she seemed desperate and she kept trying to talk to me. It seemed like it was real... But then again, it had to be a dream, right? Who knows.

Memories of a Murderer 2,Canada,Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: Memories of a Murderer 2

T his is part two to my last story Memories of a Murderer . I recently went back to Calgary with my fiance and little brother to visit my cousin. She just had a baby so I flew up to go see him. After we got to Calgary we visited with family and had a BBQ to celebrate the new addition to the family, and after a long day of fun we decide to head to our hotel room. We had to stay in a hotel because my cousin lives in a condo and has no room for people to stay.

After we got to our hotel room, we decide to watch some TV and get some rest. Being the smart guy he is, my little brother flipped to the show ""Most Haunted"" and said, ""I wonder what the deal is with our old place in Airdrie"".

And Me being the even SMARTER guy said ""It's only 9... lets go see"".

So we headed down to our crappy rent-a-car and took a little drive out to Airdrie. When we arrived to the house we noticed that the place was still there. I figured someone might have torn it down because nobody has lived in it for over 10 years. Nope, still there... Still empty.

We parked the car and got out. Chris didn't move, he sat there gripping his seatbelt with a very terrified look on his face.

""No dude... No way in hell are you going to get me in there""... But he came anyways.

We took the walk up the front lawn and to the side of the house where a window leading to the kitchen was. There was a trick to opening it from the outside, and I managed to wriggle it loose after a few minutes. One by one we crawled into the darkness of the house. I fumbled around the wall for the light switch and flicked the lights on. The second the lights went on, all three of us felt this cold wind blow through the hall, and slammed the door that once belonged to my parents' room. (That must be where the male entity resides... Which would explain the shadows my parents saw in the night)

After the door slammed, Chris grabbed my arm and said ""No dude...can't do this... I am the F*** out of here man...""

We explored the main floor for a little while, completely ignoring the master bedroom... We didn't want to make things worse then they were. We were scared enough as it was.

We then made our way to the basement. This is when things got very uncomfortable for myself. When we reached the bottom of the stairs I flicked on the lights... And as I suspected, the stain on the floor was there. I took a step around the corner to admire the wood-work my dad had done... Very impressive. I smiled and turned around to see the rest of the basement. And when I turned around I saw the picture my mom had left hanging on the wall.

I stood there frozen, just staring at the picture. It was ruined. It looked as if a black ink had boiled its way through it. Three large black blobs that shaped a grotesque looking face. And around the frame of the picture, it looked as if the wall had been burned. Like when you see the burn marks in windows after a house fire. (I'm not sure how else to explain it sorry)

My fiance Geri looked at it in shock and whispered ""Can we get out of here?""

We all agreed that leaving was probably a good idea. We ran up the stairs, leaving the lights on and headed for the kitchen window where we had come in. The window was shut! Chris pushed on it to try and get it open but he couldn't. It was like the latch had been rusted shut. We headed for the front door when we realized that it had been boarded up, so we wouldn't be able to make it through... We tried to break through it, and this was about the time when the lights started flickering on and off and we heard thumping coming from under us... As if someone was banging the ceiling below with a stick or something, only multiplied by 10. Finally after we were all terrified we decide to bust out the front window.

Hurray we escaped! We jumped in the car and putted away as fast as we could in our crappy little rent-a-car. Even as we drove down the street the lights were still flickering. We decided to go to the McDonalds down the road for some burgers, and cool our heads. We sat down at the table when Chris realized he had left his coat in the house. I punched him in the shoulder. It was a nice coat that I got him for Christmas. And he decides to take it off in a creepy haunted house, as if we were staying a while. Maybe have dessert and coffee with the crazy ghost.

We decided that now wasn't the best time to get his coat, we would go back the next day when the sun was out and we could see.

After a poor nights sleep at a cheap hotel we got up and drove back to the house... And what we saw we'll never forget.

Chris' coat was laid out neatly in the middle of the front lawn, and my moms destroyed picture lay right above it. When we walked over to pick up his coat there was a big stain on it... Much like the markings on the picture. Obviously, we decide the coat wasn't important and we headed home.

This happened about a week ago (April 27, 2008) or something like that. And we're still wondering what the hell happened. We have no idea what resides there... We figure it may be something with a demonic nature... There is still a lot of mystery surrounding this house... And no... We don't plan on finding out.

The Pink Rubber Ball,"California, United States",Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: The Pink Rubber Ball

A fter a crazy experience last week that left me quite shaken up, I came home to some more ghostly stuff. As you have read in my last story Memories of a Murderer 2 you would know that I was back in Airdrie about a week ago. It wasn't the best trip, other than the fact that I got to meet my cousins new baby boy.

After I got home a few days ago I just wanted to relax. Kick my feet up, watch some TV, put my new Harley together, etc.

I wouldn't be so lucky. The minute I stepped in the door I was annoyed. Our little ghost girl was up to no good while we were away. All of the lights were turned on, the taps were running, and the TV was on. I wasn't worried about the ghost so much as to how retarded my bills for the month were going to be... An entire month of electricity and water bills all crammed into a week.

I went around and turned off the taps and all of the lights, and I was just about to sit down when my brother called me from his room upstairs. I went up to go see what was wrong. His walls were covered with marker. Colorful scribbles all over the walls. I couldn't help but laugh, Geri said it was just like having a child of our own. Chris just stood there, arms crossed. Which made me laugh even harder because he looked so pissed off.

After we finished making fun of Chris, and how the little girl made his room all pretty, we finally got to sit down and relax.

We ordered a few movies on PPV, had some snacks, and went to bed.

The next morning I got up early to get the engine mounted onto the frame of my Harley. When I came downstairs I noticed the little pink ball sitting right next to my shoes. I smiled and as I put on my shoes I said ""Not today, sorry...""

I was working on my bike for a good 30 minutes or so, and I ran inside for a beer. I went inside, and Chris said he was going to come join me, he had to do some transmission repairs on his car. When we got back into the garage the pink ball was sitting on top of Chris' tool box. I chuckled and said ""Go kick the ball into yard..."" I knew all the little girl wanted was someone to play with.

""Seriously man, go kick it..."" I said, and Chris went and took the ball to the yard, mumbling something under his breath.

We continued working, pretty much all morning and we decided to take a trip downtown for some shopping. We all got cleaned up and I realized I left my keys on my tool box, and sure enough when I went into the garage... The pink ball was right by my bike.

I sat down on my stool and told the little girl that she can't stay here anymore. I told her that Jesus doesn't want any of his children to be trapped here on Earth, and he wants them to live an eternal life in heaven. I also mentioned that if she asked for forgiveness for her sins, then she would be free. Before leaving I also told her that she would be loved and missed by our family, but never forgotten.

We haven't noticed any change that she has crossed over yet, however, the toilet did not flush spontaneously at 6 O'clock last night like it usually does every night.

Stories from my Fiance,"Illinois, United States",Misc,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Misc :: Stories from my Fiance

T his story was told to me by my fiance, I have known him for 15 years and I know he is not teasing me because he is a serious person who is not known to tell tales just to be noticed or to be self-important.

When he was in his late 20's early 30's (he is now late 60's) he was working part-time at a gas station. One morning it was very foggy and you couldn't see the road in front of the station. He was out taking the readings on the pumps (pre the computer age) and he heard a metallic sound coming from up the road. Like a tin can or something similar rolling down the road. When it came into view, it was a metal pie plate rolling on it's side and when it came to the driveway into the station, it turned in and headed toward the front door. When it reached the door it flopped down flat. My fiance thought of how strange it was that the plate could turn into the drive like it did and if it was just rolling down the street why didn't it go pass the station and keep going.

He finished taking the readings and went into the station to enter the number into the journal, his mind off the pie plate at that time.

He thought about the plate so he glanced out the door where it as laying it started to wobble and then it jumped back up on its side and rolled out of the driveway and headed down the road. The fog was starting to lift and he could see up and down the road so he went out the door to watch the plate roll away and he saw it turn on to a dirt road that ended at an old abandon house, that some said was haunted.

Some of the things he thought about was, did the plate fall off a vehicle and roll away, but he hadn't heard any cars or trucks go by, there was no breeze so the wind didn't make the plate roll, where did it come from and what could have made the plate turn into the 2 driveways, and also it reminded him of a game kids use to play rolling pans or other objects with a stick down a sidewalk or road.

Was it a ghost of a kid playing and the heading home to his house?

One more story from my fiance, this was when he moved to Indiana and worked at an appliance store. He was divorced at that time and his boss had made him a place to live in the back of the store.

One night, after having a late dinner, he returned back at the store, and when he opened the back door, he heard what sounded like someone sweeping the floor, fast and furious, in the front showroom. He was startled because he knew the owner of the store was the type of person who when to bed at dark and would not be at work that late at night. Just in case, he called out his boss's name but got no reply, but the sweeping continued. The funny thing about it was they had just installed indoor-outdoor carpeting that very day and there was no reason for someone to be sweeping the floor like they use to do when there was only vinyl flooring.

My fiance decided to investigate, and he took a flash light and walked towards the showroom to see if he could see anyone. The sweeping stopped and of course, no one was there. He shrugged it off and went back to his room.

A short time later, in the storage room that was next to his room, there were noises that sounded like someone was taking the appliances that were still in their cartons, and slammed them into the wall. Bam Bam Bam, the wall closed to his head shook, each time another carton was slammed into the wall. That stopped before he could investigate so again he just shrugged it off. I can tell you, that I would have been out the door faster than a blink of an eye if it was me!

Later, just as he started to doze off, he said he felt a presence in the room like someone had just walked in and was staring at him, and it didn't feel friendly. After a minute or two the feeling left and there was no other activity that night or ever again.

He also said that the next day he went into the stock room to see if any of the boxed appliances had move and not only was there no evidence of the boxes being moved, the dust didn't even look disturbed, and by the sound of slamming boxes against the wall there should have been visible evidence of movement.

I can't believe that he didn't get out of that place that night and could go to sleep after it was over! I guess it's a guy thing because I don't know if I could have ever slept there again.

Bad Dream and Sulfur Smell,"Texas, United States",Misc,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Misc :: Bad Dream and Sulfur Smell

I was recently deployed to Iraq for a 18 month tour, and didn't mind too much because that was my second time there. Through out my tour we went on different missions and such. Months into the deployment we began to relax and were getting used to the fact of not being home.

I had went to church one sunday and was getting ready to leave when the chaplin had asked me if something was bothering me. I had told him ""No, I don't think so"". He said it looks like something is over you keeping you down. I told him that I felt fine and went along my way. Days later in our barracks there was this awful sulfur smell right near my bunk, it would wake me up out of my sleep it smelled so bad, but the next morning there was no smell.

As the months grew shorter the smell still remained, I would ask my bunk buddies if they smelled anything, and they would say they couldn't smell a thing. One of the nights it was really hot so I uncovered myself and rolled over, and when I opened my eyes it looked like a skeleton dancing in front of me, But when I rubbed the clear it was just my fan. When I fell back asleep, I was in this island surrounded in this lake of fire. There was this voice saying to renounce God and worship him. I knew who it was and I fell to my knees and started to pray the lords prayer, (Our father). Every time I did that he would get angry and the place would shake.

I would wake up soaking in sweat, with heavy breathing. I told everyone about my dream, and most of them said that the devil was trying to get you. This happened a few more times but the places would change and there would be family members trying to help me. Once I came home the dreams stopped. I haven't had a dream like that again. Could it be possible that he wanted me but I was too strong for him, or could it have been the fact that he knows I'm too strong to get so he would have to get me at my weakest?

Snapshots of Butterflies,"Illinois, United States",Misc,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Misc :: Snapshots of Butterflies

I feel blessed to have found a place to talk about the things I normally cannot. The friends I have hear my stories and say, ""every time, Shawn; it's always something new with you..."" They can say that, for they cannot venture into my mind and see what I believe and feel.

At any rate, I live in Dixon, IL. The house I moved into a few years ago is pretty nice, for a smaller sized home. A few things needed fixing, but nothing too major. The garage is attached, and the space for a car is adequate. Where that space stops a wall of plywood goes up ten or twenty feet and stops, giving way to a large loft above the inside of the house. I've put some boxes and stuff up there, the furnace is also in this space. It is all open and hollow, with the exception of the two by fours criss crossing above the area; the framework if you will.

Why it was designed this way is beyond me, but at first it was cool and useful. The first year here was normal, nothing out of the ordinary. In the second year, 2007, things that I had no clue were going on started to become known.

The first time I noticed anything was one night during the summer of that year. It was the middle of the week, I had to work the next day, but I decided to get on the computer for a tick. Where I sit at the computer in relation to the space above is the farthest point back in this open area. Listening to music, talking to people, whatever; but something I must have said caused a stir. I started to hear footsteps directly above me. Lighter ones, but noticeable nevertheless. The instant I thought to myself that it is not footsteps there is a loud THUD, as if someone stomped one time in the spot where they were walking. I turned the music off, told everyone to hold on, and just sat for a moment. I stared straight up at the ceiling, anticipating the next sound. Another THUD, even louder and it made me jump out of my chair to my feet. My curiosity at the time was very much alive, I say at the time because nowadays I do not wish to know of what is standing around or next to me.

Forcing me outside, my mind seemingly carried my body to the side door of the garage. I opened and walked through the door, into the darkness. The air inside was even more humid than the air outside. As soon as I flicked the light switch on, pop, blown bulb; what a surprise. This should have been the inkling to just go back inside, but no; I have to figure this out. I went back inside and grabbed a flashlight, electing not to use my camera for fear that I will capture something I wish not to.

Upon re-entering the blackness of the garage, the humid nature of the atmosphere inside had given way to a much more cooler and clear sensation. Not exactly cold, simply less thick and desolate. Whatever was up there I prayed in my mind not to fear me or scare me, for I have a very weak heart. Going up the wall in the middle of the plywood are a patch of stairs, more like a wooden ladder. I climbed up and when I made it to the top I stood for a moment, my light pointed dead to rights at the very back of the space. Nothing was there, and I should have left it at that (again).

An extremely strong odor arises, I cannot name it exactly but I would compare it to maybe a dead animal that has been sitting in the sun for hours. As strange as that sounds it's just a comparison; I do not go around sniffing dead animals.

It seemed to get more pungent the further I walked, and with the furnace at the front of this loft I would have smelt it right away and not after I passed it if that were the case. A few more steps forward, nothing else can obscure my view of what is in front of me at this point. I remember that I took another step forward, then it gets a little unclear. Anyone who has ever been choked out or passed out knows that you feel as though you in a sense separate from reality and come out of it feeling like nothing happened.

After I took that step I blacked out, for images of things I do not wish to speak of began to fly past my vision in a frantic sequence. So unnerving in fact that ever since then I have had many seriously terrible dreams dealing with some of those same things. At a certain point I began to feel as though nothing was going to bring me out of this, and like the snap of a finger it stopped. I came completely out of it standing on my feet, my flashlight laying on the boards by my right foot. It was pointing towards the same corner where I heard the sounds, above where I was sitting inside the house. The shock of what had just conspired was certainly unreal. Surely all this was in my mind, but regardless I picked up the light and retired to my bed.

Such physical sensations have not been felt since then, but as fore mentioned I have these horrible dreams from time to time. In my opinion, I think the spirit had passed through my body, and the shock of how evil it may have been sent my soul into a tailspin of sorts. Little creaks and scrapes do not scare me; this an old house. Only when the sound is like what I heard that night is when I become intensely nervous of my surroundings. Never inside the house, to which I find very odd.

The end of the summer brought an end to this madness, but with this year's summer close at hand I pray it does not start again. Venturing up there now is a test in volition for me, even just out to get in my car. Since it is an open area, if you were to walk inside the garage you would be able to see all the way back there. Even during the day, it is still black as night in that region where it happened.

Anyone who would care to tell me what they think are more than welcome to; my feelings about this are a bit scattered as you may have guessed. If you ask me to elaborate on what I had seen, please know that if you were me you would not want to talk about it either.

The Moaning Lady,Oman,Misc,"H ello everyone! My English Teacher told this story to me about her experience in Oman. So I am telling you her story. We will call my english teacher, Ms.Jane (so not to give her real name). Ms. Jane had gone to Oman looking for a job in a school. She did get one and was sent to Southern Oman in a mini-van, with a bunch of other new teachers. It was getting dark and it was still a long way to go so they stopped at a big hotel.

While Ms. Jane was eating and talking with the other teachers, this one teacher was looking at her all the time. Ms. Jane knew that teacher as they were in the same van, so she thought the lady wanted to talk to her. But before she could go to her, that lady had gone to the bathroom. When everyone was going to sleep, (everyone was going to sleep in one big room, on bunk beds) the lady (whose name we will call Ms.Loona) asked Ms. Jane whether she, Ms.Loona, could sleep on the top bunk. Ms.Jane, without hesitating, said yes.

At the middle of the night, Ms. Jane woke up to the noise of a lady moaning slowly. Ms. Jane got terrified to even move. Then, she saw a weird sight. In front of her, she could see dangling legs. Then she realized that the legs were of Ms.Loona! Actually, what had happened was that, Ms. Loona was sitting on her bed with her legs dangling down, moaning softly but harshly. When Ms. Jane got the guts to look up, she saw that Ms.Loona's eyes were wide open and were not moving. Terrified at seeing that, Ms. Jane just got in her bed and went to sleep somehow.

The next morning, when Ms. Jane got up, she asked Ms. Loona what happened to her last night. But Ms. Loona said that she didn't know what happened at all and that she was sleeping soundly. After that, Ms. Jane never saw Ms. Loona again, as they were in a different school. Ms. Jane knew it was not a dream because another friend of hers had been in the same school as Ms. Loona and had experienced the same incident.

Ms. Jane was saying to us that she did not know if a spirit was inside her or a demon had taken over Ms.Loona. Even I am confused. Does anyone have an answer for this?

Face in the Window,United Kingdom,Apparitions / Voices / Touches,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Apparitions / Voices / Touches :: Face in the Window

T his is my first post and a very brief story of an occurrence that happened to me. I was about 14 years old and was leaving my house at approx 8am to go to school. My brother was at college and my sister at university. Both parents had gone to work (they worked together so left at the same time).

I walked out of my house and for some reason looked back and up at my parents window. Staring our of the window was my mums face but with a really mean horrible expression on it. I looked away after a few seconds and carried on walking.

It freaked me out at the time but not thought much of it since as it only happened that once. Also, noises could be heard in the house for no apparent reason - we would be downstairs watching tv and hear the sound of a vase or something similar crashing onto the floor in my bedroom (which was directly above the sitting room) but on going up there nothing had happened and the noise could not be explained.

Also our cat used to stare into space but I believe this is quite common with animals so again didn't think anything of this. Both my parents are very straight headed and do not believe in the paranormal. Thoughts would be welcome. I will post another story shortly.

After School Ghost,"New Jersey, United States",Apparitions / Voices / Touches,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Apparitions / Voices / Touches :: After School Ghost

I have a previous story called My Haunted Bedroom now I will share with you an incident that happened 2 months after the bedroom one.

This incident happened in my High school during the month of January. Me and my friend Allan stay after school every now and then. We just hang in the halls and talk about silly things. We were joking around saying that the school was haunted and that we were going to get scared. Little did we know we were stating the truth.

We were laughing and then we heard what sounded like a finger nail scratching a chalkboard. We shrugged it off thinking it was just a teacher or maybe another student writing on the board. We would continue walking and going through the school to different floors.

We would hear this scratching on the chalkboard following us to every classroom and every floor as we would walk by. Now we knew this was not normal because no human being or living thing could possibly get to a classroom on a different floor that fast or for that matter get into a classroom without us seeing them.

I was frightened by this thing because I thought I was being followed by my haunted bedroom buddy. Me and Allan were really moved by whatever was following us so like any normal person would do, we basically ran out of the school building. As we would approach a door to get out we figured out that it was locked. We couldn't figure a logical explanation for this because all the doors couldn't possibly be locked that fast when school ended at 2:32 and it was only 3:00...there would still be teachers in the building.

We finally found a teacher to help us out. She showed us an exit and it was one of the several doors we tried to get out off, and to our surprise it opened just as it would regularly. Me and Allan looked at each other as if this ghost was playing tricks on us. The teacher asked us if we were alright because she said we looked lost and confused, we were definitely not lost but we were VERY confused.

Do you think my haunted bedroom ghost comes to school with me? I'm very confused and scared.

Old Castle Farm,United Kingdom,Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: Old Castle Farm

T his is my first story so I apologize if I go on a bit or the punctuation isn't up to scratch. Its hard to focus on one story because there are so many, I will be posting more, hopefully, however they may not be in order but I will try to explain them properly.

I have had many experiences through my life but by far the most ""active"" ones have been recently. In the beginning of 2006 I was told I had partial kidney failure and I had to have quite a few operations, during that time my mom and step dad kindly asked if I'd like to move in with them and my five younger brothers so they could help look after me and my three year old daughter while my partner was at work. Thinking it would make things easier we agreed and moved in with them. Not long after virtually everybody in the house had some sort of experience.

I should also tell you that the house is called Old Castle Farm and is situated in a very small village that is more of a hamlet really as there are only twelve other houses around. Our house dates back to the 15th century and still has the original beams in the original part, since the house was built it has been extended a few times. The bedroom that myself, partner and daughter moved into was in the original part of the house. The door way to my bedroom is tiny and at 5ft2 I still have to duck to get through. Opposite my bedroom door and also in my youngest brothers bedroom are priest holes. I have been told that these priest holes were used to hide priests.

During the first couple of weeks living there I saw shadows, heard voices, footsteps, the kitchen chairs sliding across the floor in the early hours of the morning, during the day when everyone was at work or school it sounded like people where walking around upstairs or opening dresser draws, which can all be explained somehow, such as its just the age of the house, echoing, my imagination etc. But I've also heard wind chimes a lot and we don't have any.

One day after just getting out of the bath my daughter came running into the bathroom ""mommy there's a man in our bedroom"" bare in mind we are alone in the house, I start to panic thinking someone has broken in, and I'm stuck as to get out of the house I'd need to go past my bedroom where this man is. So grabbing my daughter I crept down the landing to the point where I could see my bedroom door. I could see into the main part of the bedroom but it was empty and I couldn't hear anything except the birds outside and my own heart beat. I slowly crept forward so I could see further into my bedroom, there was no one in there.

So I actually went into the room still holding onto my daughter, the room was empty and no one had come out of there otherwise I would have seen them. Putting my daughter down I went to check under the bed, just in case, ""he's behind the door mommy"" the only thing is that when the door is open it actually rests virtually against the wall so I knew nobody was behind there. Suddenly my daughter runs out of the room down the corridor to the top of the stairs laughing ""quickly mommy we have to catch him"" this was the first time my daughter saw this man, unfortunately it wasn't the last and I'm not sure whether its the same person that she see's because now she won't go upstairs on her own even during the day.

There have been a few times that we'll be walking down the hallway upstairs and she'll stop in her tracks and the look on of fright on her face... It scares me.

Old Castle Farm 2,United Kingdom,Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: Old Castle Farm 2

A s stated on my previous story the house where I live is haunted and there are many stories from this house and my childhood house that I will post but they may not be in order... sorry.

Last week I was in our computer room which is at the very back of the house and is part of the original structure. It was about 2.00am and I was waiting for my brother to phone me for a lift from work. Often in this room even with the door closed it feels as if someone is standing right behind you watching you. There have even been times when I'll be on the pc and suddenly I get this feeling and no matter what I'm doing I turn the pc off and I'm out of there straight away. A few times I have done this it actually feels like who ever it was in the pc room follows me through the kitchen up the stairs and only when I'm in my room and shut the door an I safe to relax, of course I could just be paranoid.

The other night, it had just turned 2.00am and my brother still hadn't called me. Then I hear a car pull onto our driveway, typically I had waited up for him and he had gotten a lift from someone from work and not even bothered to phone and let me know. We'll call the person who gave him a lift Anna. The rest is an account from my brother so I will use ""I"" instead of ""he said"" etc.

""Anna pulled up onto the driveway and sat with the car idling and she was talking bout how nice the garden was. Then she looked up at the house said ""oh"" and stared into her steering wheel. ""What's the matter"" I asked. ""Your house is haunted by four ghosts, an old couple, a young boy and a young girl, the little girl is very angry. Not with your family but with the way she passed""

I should have told you that Anna reads peoples auras and can see things others can't. When my brother told me this I think I literally had heart palpitations! The month before my mom and step dad had gotten married in the small town 5 miles from our house. After the service we all told to meet back at our house before going to the reception meal which would be in an hours time. Knowing the country lanes I got back to the house first, I'd brought with me my partner, daughter, nan and granddad. The house was locked so we had to wait out on the drive. ""Who's that?"" asked my nan pointing to the window just above our front door. Standing there was an old man. ""I don't know, probably one of my step dads relatives?"" I was confused with this as all the doors and windows were locked and when the rest of the party arrived and we were let into the house nobody was there?!

After my brother told me what she had said I asked him if he had asked her any other questions ""no"" typical of him Chris is the type of person who is really laid back and not much bothers him at all he even spends nights alone in the house, something which I have never or would ever do.

Live Death Premonition,United Arab Emirates,Family / Friends Visits,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Family / Friends Visits :: Live Death Premonition

T he story started one early morning during the time of Ramadan in (September 24, 2007). I woke up because of continuous knocking somewhere in my flat. I had the feeling it was not from a living one because when the entity felt that I woke up, the ""knocking"" stopped. I knew too that it was kind of premonition so I called everyone and told them to check on everybody. I checked my Godmother too (already in her late '90's and sick) from my cousin who is in the U.S. by email. Everything seem alright, no report of anybody seriously sick.

I have this thing about bathroom door. I don't usually close my bathroom door in the night because it usually opens by itself and I get surprised by the ""click"" sound so I leave it open only. One morning, 2 days (September 26, 2007) after the knocking incident, around 0430H, my alarm rung so the first thing I do is go to bathroom. I didn't switch on the light because that's my house and I live alone so I know the way and anyway, it's just a studio flat.

When I reached the bathroom, I saw an entity, a shadow boy (black) sat on the floor of the bathroom facing me but I didn't see the face. Of course anyone who sees something like that, wouldn't be able to get in at once. I did not get scared but surprised so what I did, I switched on the light then went back to bathroom and the boy was gone. Probably, if that boy is compared to the living, he could have been around 9-11 years old.

Again, I sent text to everyone and asked to check everybody around especially the children and explained what happened. I also sent same to my Darling here in the U.A.E. And some friends. After 5 days (October 1, 2007), my Darling called me up around 2300H and was crying, he said that he had to take a flight to his home country, his nephew is in coma. He explained to me that his nephew was run down by a speeding motorcycle which came from the wrong opposite direction and his nephew was thrown about 6 meters away and broke his skull.

Before I went back to sleep, I tried talking to my Darling nephew using my thoughts asking the boy to hang on, his family loves him. Suddenly, the hanky which was on the right side of my head (a blessed hanky) was pulled away. I knew the boy was around and I had the feeling that he won't make it. So I prayed to God to take care of him. I didn't phone my darling about that but I knew he had to go. Around 0530H the following morning (October 2,2007), my Darling called again and he was crying heavily, he said his nephew is gone so that was the right time I told him what happened to me the night before. I was crying too because I felt the boy's presence before he left and so sorry for him that he didn't get the chance to fulfill his dreams to be rich one day.

When my darling came back (after 3 weeks from his home country), he showed me the photo of his late nephew and told me some stories, we were both crying. My darling said that his nephew started working at the age of 6 in his grandfather's (my darling's father) Store and whatever allowance he got, he saved it and bought stock shares. The nephew was 11 years old only when he passed away. The entity's built/profile that I saw and the photo of the nephew were the same.

My question is, how come the nephew chose me to see him? He could have chosen the members of his own family for his death premonition. My experience on other death premonitions are usually by scents of candle, perfumes.

Screaming,Australia,Psychic / Medium,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Psychic / Medium :: Screaming

T his happened when I was young. I was staying at cronulla. I had just been to a funeral and went to my nan's to stay the night. In the middle of the night I wake up... Everything is cold and my nan is in a bedroom across from me and my brother about 4m up the hallway. ""MATTHEW"" is constantly being screamed out towards me and it seemed to go on forever then a sudden stop.

In the morning I asked my bro and nan, but they both said they heard nothing. Why did I only hear this?

Lately and I'm almost 17 now I see dark figures as I walk down the hallway in my house. Whispers come every now and then and I'm freaked about it. What have I done to get this? Why are they contacting me? Should I pray more...?

Also lately I have been seeing me die many times in my dreams and I'm not sure why its reoccurring so much. It can't be a prediction of my own death can it?

I have had dreams where they do come true like one time I had a dream about falling off my motorbike in the bush and it happened the next day in the exact same way I dreamt it.

I hope You all can provide some insight into what is happening to me and what I can do about it.

"My Story, a Personal Haunt","Massachusetts, United States",A Haunted Life,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: A Haunted Life :: My Story, a Personal Haunt

B oston Massachusetts. March 11, 1960. I was 3 months old and I was dead. I had a seizure and stopped breathing. I was lucky enough to have been in the hospital at the time and was almost instantly resuscitated. Long Beach California, same day March 11, 1960 my 19 year old Birth father ""Freddy"" had skidded into an oncoming car on his motorcycle and was killed instantly. We died within an hour of each other. This is where it all ended and where it all began. For both of us.

(Neither Freddy or my birth mother ever had custody of me, I was adopted at birth and raised by a family unrelated to me by blood but still the only family I have ever known) My first memory of any paranormal experience was in my grandparents beach house.

It all began at age 5 maybe even younger. The beach house had a lovely old staircase, it was painted and polished and always well lit. So...

There was no obvious reason for the terror I felt every time that I had to climb them! I was never able take those stairs in a normal or dignified manner until I was well into my teens. It seemed that by the time I got to the 2nd step I'd just be overwhelmed with an intense urge to run and run fast! One day I was running up that staircase so fast that I didn't see my grandmother and accidentally ran into her, she bellowed at me ""you take those stairs like the devil himself was chasing you!"" at the time it seemed an adequate description.

This ""staircase"" phenomena continued well into my thirties but only when I was alone in the house. This same house gave me an overpowering urge to try and move things with my mind, but I was always afraid to actually try it, (or put my mind to it) just in case it might work!

Later on when in my early 20's a friend from the city stayed overnight at the beach house with me. We had spent a Saturday morning with my young daughter watching cartoons. When it came time to get ready for the day my friend went halfway up the living room stairs when she stopped suddenly. She looked at her pocket book which she had forgotten at the foot of stairs and she kind of smiled, then she said ""do you ever feel like you can move things with your mind when you are in this house?""

I realized right then that I was not the only one who got ""feelings"" from the beach house. (I've heard that this old friend of mine is now a working medium/psychic) Built by my grandfather and used just as a summer cottage for many years. The beach house was always packed to its human capacity every summer night from the early 20's until the mid 60's (when it was renovated and winterized and became their private home). During the beach house glory days, my grandparents rented out rooms to random circus acts who performed at the nearby amusement park. Poker games were played late into the night. Laughter and music abound until the wee morning hours.

As far as I know though, only my grandfather has actually died in the house. (from the natural causes of old age)

In the late 80's my 9 year old daughter and I began living, on a more permanent basis, at my (since deceased) grandparents beach house. I had broken my ankle a week before and had a cast on up to my knee.

Before taking a shower that evening I had sent my daughter downstairs to make us a couple of PB&J sandwiches for us to snack on while watching tv in my bedroom before bed.

My bedroom had once been my grandfathers room but he had died 2 years earlier. My parents had inherited the house and had completely refurbished it after gramps had passed. Tearing out all the walls and putting in new insulation and new windows. The furniture was also all brand new.

I came out of the shower, limped into my bedroom, and was instantly surrounded by an intense odor of my grandfather! He used Aqua Velva but it wasn't just the smell of the aftershave, it was the way HE smelled wearing it! His own personal order was permeating the room!

I was instantly horrified, I couldn't breathe or move and I was rooted to that one spot as if glued into place! Worse yet I could hear my little daughter coming up the stairs and heading right for that very room! The last thing I wanted to do was to scare my child, but I just could not, for the life of me, summon up enough strength to so much as bat an eyelash! I tried to force my frozen face into smile as I saw her approaching, I knew how frightened she would be if she saw that I was afraid! It didn't matter.

She took one step into the room and the plate of sandwiches went flying up into the air as she screamed out loud ""GRANPAPA"" she flew out of that room at the very same moment I was released from my trap and able to follow her down the stairs hopping all the way! I actually bum bumped down the entire flight of stairs so fast that my rump hurt for weeks afterwards!

I called my big brother who worked right down the street at a local corner store, he came home right away but the smell was gone by the time he got there. I spent that night in my daughters bedroom and the next day I switched to another bedroom... For good.

Skip ahead two years... Same beach house. I was sitting in my recliner chair watching tv it was about 9 pm. Stretched out on the carpet at my feet was my ex-boyfriend also watching tv. All of a sudden he was in some sort of distress! He was desperately trying to move his body but it was obvious that something was holding him down! I could actually see an impression on his shirt while hanging above him was a dark wispy cloud!

I watched all of this as if I were in a trance, I didn't think or feel anything. I didn't make a move to help him, I just sat there as he continued to struggle, watching him as he grunted and writhed desperately fighting to move!

This was a man who had recently moved my Moms refrigerator up two flights of stairs all by himself and now he couldn't muster the strength to get up off the floor!

I have no idea how long this all lasted. But it seemed that just as suddenly he was free again, we both watched the dark shadowy cloud move toward the front door and disappear. When the cloud had disappeared we turned our heads in unison and continued watching the T.V., without saying a word, as if it had never happened!

A few weeks later while eating in a restaurant, as if on cue, we both remembered what had happened and then talked about it at great length. The fact that we both forgot about it for so long makes me wonder what other paranormal events have been erased from our memories over time?

A year later at the same house, late at night, I was in the living room alone, my daughter tucked in asleep upstairs, when several cars with lights on and music playing pulled up right outside the house.

I listened and cussed as I realized that a bunch of my buddies must be stopping by for a little late night party at my house and I wasn't going to be happy about it if they woke up my daughter!

As I was getting up and going to the front door I heard all the car doors closing maybe 4 or 5 cars I could tell they were all drunk by their laughter and the songs that they were singing (why else would my friends, the LED ZEPPLIN kids of the 1970's be singing ""how much is that doggy in the window""?).

They moved across the porch and then opened up the outside screen door just as I threw open the inside door to reveal... You guessed it! Nothing and nobody there, just a shock of cold air on a hot summer night.

This happened to me 3 or 4 times after the original incident but I was always alone. Years later my daughter told me that she had heard people out on the porch partying and when she looked outside of course there was nobody there! She had also heard crying from the upstairs bathroom on many occasions when she had been small, she said she ""just knew that it was my grandmother crying"" My daughter was only 3 when Nana died and in no way could have remembered her.

I had two major experiences when I was 17. One of these experiences was my one and only full bodied apparition sighting ever. My first experience that year was shortly after my friends boyfriend died. He had been the only one involved in a drunk driving accident.

Only a few days later and my friend, still hugely distraught, sat at my kitchen table and cried out for her dead boyfriend to hear her! She then proceeded to tell him how much she loved him and would miss him and that she forgave him. I nearly fainted dead away as soon as she had finished speaking, I had never felt so cold, or lost and out of control in all my life! Suddenly six stacked dishes just flew off the shelf behind us! And just like that I instantly felt better.

Later that year I was home on a Saturday night with my little baby. A few of my girlfriends had gone out for the night and were partying at a pub in a nearby town. Shortly after last call at the bar, when I was nearly asleep at home, one of my friends called and said her car wouldn't start and would I come and get them all in my car please?

Believe me, I wasn't feeling it, but of course I got dressed, left my baby with my mom and went to pick up my girls. When I got to the bar it was closed and my three semi drunken friends were in the parking lot surrounded by, and partying with about 20, maybe more biker dudes! I wasn't very happy about this, I was tired and I wanted to get back home to my baby!

But I got out of my car and went toward the large group all the while yelling at my friends to get in my car now! As I got nearer to the group I heard a noise to my right and turned to see a State Trooper standing about 5 ft away from me.

He had on a different kind of state cop uniform than I'd ever seen before, but all I really needed to know was the he was a cop, in the back of mind I guess I figured that they must have gotten new uniforms. I didn't have to turn my head very far from the trooper to look at my friends, so I still had him in my peripherals. I remember saying something to my friends like ""great! Now look at what you've done! The cops are here"" as I was saying this the cop started to move from my sight so I turned my head toward him but just as I did POOF he was gone! Just like that! I learned later that the uniform was actually a 1950's style uniform. As I look back I remember thinking at the time that he was wearing knee high black boots. But now whenever I think of that moment I am not so sure that there was anything at all below his knees!

I never told anyone about this for a very long time. The people who were present were too loud and never heard me tell them the cops were there.

Years later, while in my late twenties, I married and moved away from the Beach House.

My husband is a no nonsense reality based sort of bloke wasn't (and still isn't) into the paranormal thing. He tells me that he will spend enough time convening with the dead when he joins them. I can't dispute his logic there.

And I couldn't deny my instincts either. But this being a solid marriage that has stood the test of time, we managed to work out the differences.

During the early days of our marriage, though, the paranormal rarely ever came up and I never shared with him the experiences that I had. Although I did have a few worth mentioning.

Two of which happened while I was sleeping. So even though my heart and mind tell me that these things were real and that I was actually awake at the time, I could never prove it to anyone else. As evidence these incidences would have to be rejected... But I know differently.

In May of 1994 I had finally decided to look up my birth father ""Freddy"" I had met my birth mother at the age of 24 and she had given me some info on Freddy but not very much. I found myself as a product of one night fling with not much info to go on. Now that my daughter was getting older I decided to look into him, of course I knew by then that he had died tragically at a very young age.

First I went to Freddy's old high school where I had gotten some black and white photos of him, I had even located a cousin who had lived with Freddy's family as a child. So I was well into getting to ""know"" to a limited extent of course, the man who had made me.

During this time I had what YOU might call a ""dream"", but what I call a stunning and wonderful reality.

I don't remember what day it was but it was early summer around 3 am or so.

I was awakened by a bright light emanating from the middle of my oversized bedroom (what was once a 3 bedroom upstairs was now just one huge room) As the light began to fade an image began to emerge and then become more clear. I could see that it was a young man. A young man in jeans and a black leather jacket with a shock of red hair that he kept slicked back. His eyes were the blue of the ocean, his smile was shy and wide. I did not hesitate, not even for a moment, when he beckoned for me to come closer.

Yes, I knew right away that this young man was Freddy. I was lying in my bed looking right at him and he was as real as you or me, just standing there waiting for me to cross the room.

I had no fear as I gleefully hopped up and out of bed to go to him. When I hit the floor I felt younger, more alive, I felt like I had when I was in my twenties, As I continued to walk toward him I became aware that suddenly I was a teenager again, and then a young child about 8 years old, As I reached him I realized that I was now only a very young child, of 3 or maybe 4.

I stood before him and reached my arms up to him I was now only about as tall as his waist. He bent down and lovingly gathered me up in his arms and then he began to turn slowly. As he turned I felt myself getting smaller in his arms. I become younger, smaller, a toddler perhaps. When he completed the turn, though, I was a new born... An infant again.

Freddy cuddled me in his arms as we gazed lovingly at each other, blue eyes to blue eyes soaking up the love that we had never known. And yes I knew that I was now an infant. I was aware of it all. Everything as it was happening not a dream but so far out of reality...

It seemed like we stayed like that for hours locked into each other eyes, at the same time it I know it could only have been moments. Then Slowly he began to turn again in the opposite direction, and as he did I began to get bigger and older again. I felt so sad! I became frightened I didn't want to leave him! But he held me closely and I just knew everything would be alright.

When he let me down from his arms I was just 4 years old again. He then had to give me a gentle push to make me walk back towards my bed, I just didn't want to lose him again! But I went and as I was walking I began to age again I was 13, then 15, 20, then 25. I got back into bed, and pulled the blankets over my head once again I was a 34 year old and I was crying.

I woke up crying. Could I really have had such an imaginative dream? Or did Freddy really return to me, fueled by my sudden interest in him? Was this his way of telling me that he had been with me my entire life? I wish I knew. I do know one thing. If it was a dream it has never faded as dreams do. I hold dearly every moment of the entire experience as if it just happened yesterday.

The very next day I went to visit Freddy's grave for the first time. A huge old cemetery about 10 miles from my home I had never been there before. I went right to Freddy's grave. Right to it with no help at all. I had never done anything like that before but I do believe that given the right situation, I could maybe do it again.

April 22, 1996 around 1 am. I was so sick with allergies and bronchitis that I had been asleep for about 13 hours. Suddenly I sat straight up as I felt the (air, wind, presence? I don't know what) come rushing at me. I felt my MOM in a rush of the moment, she was in front of me and I was with her. And then she was in me and I became her (feeling thinking smelling knowing ALL that was my mother) and then she was gone. I laid back down just as my husband asked ""what is it? What was that?"" and I calmly replied ""my mother just died"" and I rolled over and went back to sleep.

Of course it's true. She really did die at that moment. But why hadn't I woken up and ran downstairs and called someone? Why did I just roll over without doing anything? And what about my husband? Why wasn't he startled awake by my frightening words? We simply went back to sleep! Maybe my mind was rejecting what it had just been through. Or maybe it had been exhausted by the experience. It was just so real.

My mother went right through me and although I can never prove it I know that it really happened. A special moment between body and soul that will never be forgotten. I was left knowing that I wasn't saying goodbye, I was saying so long and see you soon. I was left with the absolute knowledge of her love for me from the inside out!

The next 10 years, leading up to our moving into the haunted house in Salem, were pretty uneventful. I did receive 3 phone calls from people who had recently passed. I know that sounds nuts but it really happened. The first call was in 96 shortly after my mom died.

I got home from work and there was a call from an old friend on my caller ID from 5 am that morning. I couldn't imagine why he had called after so many years of not talking or even seeing each other. But soon the phone rang again and my ID read that it was his phone again. I picked it up said hello a few times but got no response. I forgot all about it until a few days later when I learned he had passed. He had died the night BEFORE he called me. He died in his home around 11pm and was discovered the next night a 6pm. Calculations say he was alone, unfounded and dead in his bed from a drug overdose, when he called me.

One year later a similar story another dear departed old friend calling me from his home (according to my caller ID) moments after he died in the hospital from a post surgical complication.

In 2003 my own dear brother passed in his sleep at the age of 54. His heart simply gave out. It was so unexpected that we were all just in a fog, emotionally crushed, hurting and totally out of sorts.

My brother had worked at the same corner store/ restaurant for several years. Within hours after his death my brothers boss started calling me. My caller ID gave the phone and the name of the restaurant it read simply Smitty's corner PAY PHONE with the phone #. He continued to call me over and over for the next two days but I just couldn't answer, I was buried in my grief and didn't want to talk to anyone except my family.

It was almost a week later when my daughter and I went to Smitty's corner for a memorial to celebrate my brothers life. I had just glanced at my brothers boss when it suddenly struck me! There was no reason for him to be calling me from the outside payphone! He would of called from inside the store, or his cell phone or home phone, but not the pay phone!

And why would he call so many times over and over when he knew we were grieving? I just knew at that very moment that it had been my brother! Sure enough when I got home the caller ID said Smitty's corner again. It was the last time he ever called and to this day I regret not taking any of those calls!

I chalk up those phone calls as a pre cursor to my ability to catch evp so easily now. Am I a medium, a sensitive or psychic? I have no idea and I am not sure if I am willing to find out... yet.

My husband and I moved to Salem from the south shore of MA in October 05. The reason we moved up country was to make an easier commute for my husband.

We soon found a lovely little cottage right across the street from a small lake, we fell in love and agreed to buy the little house the first time we saw it.

Right off I loved our little home by the lake. It had been recently renovated so everything was new and gleaming. Before I moved in I spent several days there with my husband putting up shelves pictures and curtains. I never sensed or felt anything that seemed strange to me during those days shortly before moving in.

When moving day came my (now adult) daughter was a big help. This was her first time seeing the place and I couldn't wait for her to see how close it was to the lake. She has always loved to swim and sunbathe so I just knew she was going to love the place!

Well...she didn't. She hated it and I saw it in her eyes the minute she got inside. She kept trying to tell me ""it's nice Ma, you are going to like it here"" but her eyes did not agree with what her lips were saying.

Later my husband told me that she had complained that the house had a terrible odor all through it. She couldn't understand why nobody else could smell it? A year later she admitted to me that her first time in the house made her feel like she needed to run out of there, go home and ""wash the creepy off"".

I wish she had told me how she felt. But I understand why she didn't. We had never lived so far apart before (about an hour and 1/2) and we missed each other like crazy. Ok, so we did talk on the phone 1-4 times a day but it was not the same as actually being together.

My daughter is my heart. We are very close and we love each other dearly. When she would visit us she would normally stay a few days or more if her work schedule permitted. So she did stay over night on and off over the next year.

Even though we didn't seem to be getting along so well a that time, I would gleefully wait for her return to the little cottage but unfortunately whenever she did come back...

She would be a monster! From the moment she stepped into that house until the end of her stay. (when I was rushing her out the door) She was very bad-tempered and constantly trying to pick fights! She would then go home and call me and thank me telling me she had a great time and how grateful she was for my cooking and my love... And that she was sorry for being in such a bad mood. She would sound, again, like the sweetheart she really is.

I blamed her moody behavior on my moving away and all was forgiven and forgotten.

The very day I moved into the cottage I started to smell a terrible odor. For the life of me I could never understand why I hadn't smelled it before moving in?

The stench seemed to come out of everywhere, the walls the floors the ceilings. It was intensely strong and nasty but would only last for a few minutes making it impossible to find the exact source of it. Yet we would smell it often. It wasn't a case of getting used to a bad odor after being in the house for awhile. No, this stench would come suddenly from out of nowhere even after I had been in the house for hours. Yet I never thought that any of this could be paranormal. Not once. I had gotten crusty and set in my ways now having reached my mid forties, I didn't remember my earlier paranormal experiences.

I set up my chair by the window in the living room facing my tv. Shortly after moving into that spot I started hearing a sound that I knew I recognized. It was the sound of a horse. Pawing and snorting outside my little cottage window.

I would quickly shut out the light and peer into the darkness but the horse would be gone. I thought that it must be a neighbors horse got loose but then I'd soon forget about it.

Until late one night when it happened again. I got up and ran into the pitch darkness of my front yard (I really like horses and I was determined to meet this one) when I got out to the middle of the yard I suddenly became filled with a mind numbing fear as the deep blackness surrounded me. I spun into fight or flight mode and I chose the latter... But instead of being able to run away I got the dreaded ""lead"" legs. I felt like I was walking through waist high water with heavy chains wrapped around me that kept pulling me back. The door to the cottage was open and I could see the light of the living room shining through it. It looked to be about a mile away but I knew it was only a few steps! YIKES! But I finally find my way to the door and somehow my ""right"" mind made me blow off this experience as well. I told myself that I had probably been asleep at the time that it had never happened. A dream. A nightmare. Anything but reality.

Many times while inside the house I had called out for my husband and he would answer me in muffled tones. The house was very small so we should have been able to hear each other easily. I would go looking for him and see him outside busy working in the yard. As if he had been there for hours. Never once did I question it or ever guess that it was paranormal.

My husband is the type of guy who likes to work all the time. He was tearing up and putting things back together in the cottage the whole time we were there. Hammer/saws/drills whenever he was home there were tool noises going on.

He replaced the heating system and added 2 more heating zones to the house. Then he built an additional room onto the front porch.

It wasn't just a small amount of work that he was doing, It was actually pretty heavy duty for such a small space. I've heard that even a mild amount of construction can bring about spirits and if that is true that would explain how I ended up with a houseful of them!

Then there were the smells. Strong tobacco smells that would come and go in a non-smoking home. Whole meals cooking at 3 am, and a strong scent of soap which I recognized as Ivory soap, no! No! Not just a scent but a nose tingling, tear inducing odor of Ivory soap, it would only last a few moments but it was so close to me and so thick that it would literally turn my stomach.

A large barn-shaped shed sat on the property. Stored in it were over 6,000 record albums and 45's. My husband had inherited my late brothers record collection. There were so many records that my husband had to build several shelves in the shed to store them on.

Often I would be in the yard and I would hear music coming from the shed. I never questioned it I just assumed that my husband had forgotten to turn off his radio. Many times I would hear tools working in the shed when my husband wasn't home and the shed should be empty. But when I got up close to it I could no longer hear them. I thought the noise must be coming from another home and ricocheting somehow off of our shed.

And then there was the great wind that would blow from my refrigerator door. Now as I look back I can not explain how or why I just accepted this phenomena? There were no windows no doors no drafts anywhere near the refrigerator yet many times a fierce gust of wind would seemingly blow from the refrigerator door with enough force to swing my ponytail back and forth. Somehow I just accepted it as if it were a normal everyday occurrence! When it did finally dawn on me that it was paranormal, I tried to debunk it but there were no clear answers.

Oct 25 2006 My daughter stayed over in the small spare room downstairs that I used as a dressing room. She was on an air mattress and looked quite comfortable. We had just finished watching all her favorite scary shows and it was 4 am. I went off to the upstairs bedroom where I got into my bed just as hubby was getting out of it to go to work.

An hour later I was deep into a really decent sleep when I felt someone get into bed with me. I knew right off who it was so I ask my 30 year old daughter ""Aren't you a little old to be getting in Mommy's bed?"" She tells me that there is something ""staring at her"" in that room and she cannot and will not sleep in there! I say ""OMG! It's just the cats looking at you and you've been watching scary movies all night""! But I was too tired to resist and instead went back to sleep.

The next day my daughter decided to split a day early vowing she wouldn't spend one more night in that room! Now I knew I had to do something soon I wanted my child to feel safe in my house! I decided to do something that I had seen on one of her (what I called) ""ghostly shows"" it was TAPS Ghost hunters show where I had learned about recording with an audio recorder to ""hear"" spirit voices, called EVP.

This was the answer on how I was going to prove to my daughter, believer of ghosts, that there was really no such thing as the boogeyman and that my house was NOT haunted!

I don't know why I didn't remember the paranormal events that I had experienced while I was younger. But I now saw myself as staunch, reality based, level headed. A dam Capricorn for Goodness sake! I just didn't believe in the paranormal anymore and I had no idea what had happened to change that.

Anyway, the next day I forgot all about putting a recorder in the spare room. I probably would of forgotten about it all together.

But then I heard a voice! I was in my living room and my husband was on the front porch sawing (very loudly) some plywood for one of his shelves. Once he started up the saw I heard, as clear as day, a female voice right beside me complain ""Oh no! Not again""

Well I couldn't ignore this at first. I started to believe that it really happened! This lasted for about an hour before I talked myself out of it again. I decided that it was my next door neighbors voice that I had heard. Even though it was cold out and all my windows were closed, and the voice had come from right beside me.

But I did put a recorder in the dressing room. I shut the door. I used a digital audio recorder (the Sony B ICD B300) and I set it to voice activated. This was the evening of Oct 27th. I left it on overnight shutting it off in the early morning. There was about 50 minutes on the recording and much of it was just cars rolling down the busy route in front of the house. I did not know how interesting this recording would become until later on that night.

The night of Oct 28th 06 I got roped into going to the lumber yard with hubby it was on the way to the grocery store and as usual I would wait in the truck. Most times I brought a newspaper or catalog along with me but this time I grabbed the recorder and earphones to listen to the recorder while waiting. I knew that I could prove once and for all to my daughter that the room was NOT haunted and I could do so by using a method I saw on her own favorite program!

And then I heard the laughter! I listened to the tape and clearly there was a *child laughing and a man speaking right into the recorders microphone! It was impossible, but it was true! I stuffed the recorder into my bag and did my shopping like I was in sort of dream state. I just couldn't wait to get somewhere quiet and listen to that tape!

The first evp I heard was of a man saying ""let me out"" and then a child's laughter. So clear and so close to the microphone these people could only have been in that very room! I listened to the end of the recording and heard nothing else but then I started it from the beginning. The first evp on the recording is of a man saying *""f you mother"" then a sharp intake of breath, it is loud and clear and could only have come from someone speaking directly into the microphone! The next evp was a man saying ""I'm coming I love you"" and he breathes heavily. There are loud banging noises in these recordings that I hadn't heard during the recording only after the playback. I knew this was impossible and yet here was the very evidence in my hand!

I sat on the whole thing for about 24 hours. Then I started to try and debunk everything. I began by leaving the recorder in the same spot as I had gotten the original recordings.

I went to every room in the house and spoke in a natural level tone as the voices on the recorder had. Then I went and stood outside the room near my neighbors yard and I spoke in a natural voice and then I called to my husband in a loud voice, and then a good loud yell even though he wasn't home at the time. At this point I still didn't want the neighbors to think I was crazy. (That soon changed when I began to go out in the middle of the night to take pictures of my shed, by then I no longer cared who thought what about my mental state) I needed to see if the yelling had penetrated the outside wall.

It didn't. So one at a time I turned on every radio and tv in the house while leaving the recorder on in the same spot. None of the voices emanating from these sources sounded anything like the voices I had heard in the earlier recordings.

I took a walk around my neighborhood searching for extra large antenna on top of cars and homes but came up with nothing. Later I drove around and looked for antenna within a few miles of my house again nothing.

I rustled paper and thick paper bags, I turned doorknobs and faucets. I noted all creaks and groans while walking around the home and NOTHING. (I learned a tip here, you can step on a board in one room and it can groan in another room) I recorded the water running, the toilet flushing, microwave going everything that I thought might be causing the voices but nothing even came close.

Naturally the only thing left to do was to try it again. So here is what I did. I waited until I knew my husband and I would be going out. I was so new at evp that I still thought, for some reason, that the voices would only come if the recorder was left alone.

I made a big point of going around the house and shutting everything down and then I went around and unplugged everything I turned on the recorder at this time and sat down to write out my grocery list in complete silence. I got up put my coat on and had to search for a few moments for my keys. I then put on my boots and I left, leaving the recorder running.

During my last moments in the house I made no noise except for my flip flops flopping as I walked around looking for my keys. But the recorder tells a different story. There are three voices.* A woman talking then yelling, a child screaming then talking, and a man whispering throughout deeper in the background. This evp is 41 seconds long.

I had no idea at the time that an evp this clear and this long was highly unusual. After all everything about this whole thing was still pretty strange to me!

When I first heard this evp for just a moment I thought I must be going to die! I mean there were people talking in my home from all around me but I could only hear them on a recorder! What else could it be but some sort of sign of my approaching death? Or some other equally impending doom?

Of course I knew these ideas were crazy! It was obviously aliens, a parallel universe, or the FBI secretly taping us (hubby's idea) maybe it was our own brain waves projecting our voices out loud? Were the cats talking to us psychically? The neighbors or previous owners playing a joke?

But then it hit me. It wasn't any of those things. It really was the voices of the dead!

What happens in a ""eureka"" moment like this? Well you want to tell everyone about it and as fast as possible! There is life after death!

I really thought that everyone was just going to believe me. I called people, I went online and sent emails. It was Tuesday Oct. 31st. My own sister laughed at me and said ""happy Halloween"" before hanging up.

Only my daughter was willing to believe me and ooo-ed and aahh-ed over the evp, in spite of the fact that it was Halloween and that I often told her scary stories around this time. She did, however, get to mention "" I told you so""

I listened to that one crazy long evp over and over again trying to understand the words it contained. The woman sounds likes she is speaking Japanese, a child screams and all the while a man is whispering menacingly in the background. So damn scary yet somehow so compelling to me!

At this point I still had only 4 evp while today I have over 500 collected since that night in Oct 06.

Unfortunately we only lived there for another year and ½ because it turned out that the dirt basement was very bad for my health and we had to let the home go.

During our stay in the little cottage my husband and I had several more paranormal experiences and I did contact a paranormal team who confirmed that the home was haunted they did this by collecting their own video and evp evidence. It was wonderful to have the haunting confirmed but at the end of the day I was still pretty much taking the haunting on as my own, becoming more and more obsessed on a deeper and more personal level.

I saw a bottle spin on it's end all by itself, I watched in stunned silence and then got dizzy myself and had to go throw up. It was as if I had been spun myself.

And my husband (once a non believer now not able to dispute the evidence) continually felt something getting up on the bed with him. All the while he kept dreaming about a golden retriever named ""ruffle's"" one night while sleeping my husband began to scream out loud ""I don't want a dog"" he was kicking and screaming and moaning and I couldn't wake him up! He finally settled down and I went back to sleep. When I mentioned it to him the next day he remembered dreaming about ""ruffles"" again but thought it had been a good dream and not the nightmare that I described. These dog dreams continued for my poor husband throughout our stay in the cottage. Thankfully though, he has never complained about them since leaving.

I remember one time (long before I had realized that I was living in a haunted house) I told my Doctor that I was getting an extremely cold feeling on my left shin that would come and go, he said he had no idea what it could be other than a draft. Righto, it was a draft that had the ability to follow me from room to room and hit me in the same exact spot every time! The cold spot on my leg was a constant until we moved in late 2007 and has never returned since.

I don't know if there was ever a pet there for sure, but if I had to guess I would have to say yes! There was one. A golden named ""ruffles""

By November of 2006 I was all a frenzy recording day and night not only in the house but, wherever I would go in between. I recorded in the car, at the store, in restaurants and other peoples homes. One time when I was terribly sick with asthma (a by product of living in the cottage) and had to go to the hospital I begged my husband to go and get me the recorder before we left. I'll never forget the pitiful way he looked at me when he flatly refused.

I hadn't even gotten into taking pictures yet, that would come later and would open up another whole universe for me to explore... My shed.

By the end of November in 06 I already had more than 30 class ""A"" evp in only a month.

It would be another month before the Taps Family team would get to the house. Two months since the first recording.

And two very eventful months they were! I had gotten some of my very best recordings in November and December of 06. And I had learned, by research, who two of my new ""friends"" were.

Henry had been the last person who had owned the home who had lived in it. It had been sold, renovated and resold in a turnover to my husband and I.

Henry had lived a long life and had died in 2004. His wife Evelyn had also lived in the house and had died in 1984.

* I have a cute recording of both of them where I say to Henry ""do you want us to leave Henry? Are we taking your space""? Henry answers ""I'm fine"" which is ended with a polite cough suggesting that Henry's wife Evelyn was not so happy with us being there!

Henry seemed to really like my husband and began to ""speak"" most often whenever he was around. I found out later that they did have much in common as far as liking to work on the outside and smoking cigarettes right down to their Similar slim and tall build. (I learned from a neighbor how Henry actually looked) One of my favorite recordings of Henry and hubby is when my husband had come in for a moment to warm up from working outside, as he was leaving again he asks me *did I come in here with a pkg of butts, probably not"" you can clearly hear Henry answer ""I don't think so""

Once after having made hubby a cup of coffee* I asked him if he wanted some more sugar? He answers yes, and then I ask how many (sugars)? He says ""a couple and I need a stirrer too!"" The spirit of who I now believe is Henry answers ""are you sure about that?""

I felt no fear of these two, Henry and Evelyn, and I was always happy whenever I heard their voices on my recorder playback. But, there is a child in my recordings as well. She once said her name was Sam on one of my earlier recordings but it is a ""d"" recording and won't transfer well. I could never locate any info on this child in the public records as I had Henry and Evelyn.

Sam seemed to spend most of her time in my dressing room and for whatever reason I was often frightened by her, REALLY frightened! She didn't have the same calming effect on me as the other two. I swear that one evening she made me play music on my computer that I didn't want to hear. It was old and creepy lullaby music that was part of a spam that I had accidentally opened and was just about to delete. Instead I was stricken with the urge to play it over and over again rooted to my chair and sick to my stomach until I finally was able to stop!

But, once I was able to stop obsessively clicking my mouse, I calmed down again right away again almost as if I were being soothed. I then quickly grabbed my recorder and turned it on... As I was getting the heck out of there and going to bed! I shut off my computer and my AOL which (as aol users know) says *goodbye. The next day I discovered the recording contained a voice clearly answering Aol's goodbye with a hearty ""bye"" of her own.

I believe it was Evelyn that night who stepped in and stopped me from playing that creepy song maniacally over and over again. I believe that she was still with me and saw me to bed that night to keep me safe from Sam.

I knew that Sam was manifesting as a child but I never believed that she died as a child. I think she just chooses to come back as one. Perhaps to her happier days when she vacationed as a child by the lake. Even though she didn't always act like an innocent child. I firmly believe that the spirit of Sam is very real and exceptionally strong and was even somehow able to compel me to do her bidding on two separate occasions!

I would most often have to leave the door closed and stay away from it when I was alone in the house and at night. One early morning however around 3 am I was simply overcome with the urge to go in"" there..."" I was actually talking myself into going into a room at 3 am that I was afraid to go near at 3 pm!

I was trembling I was so afraid to go in but, I ""knew"" that I had to do it!***

I went in to take pictures of Sam at her request or rather at her other worldly insistence! I closed the door and closed my eyes, shut the light out, clicked the pic and then turned on the lights before opening my eyes! Scared wasn't the word for it! I could only manage to do this twice before I had to flee. The results were pretty obvious to me. Sam was a solid white blob with little orbs flowing off her! Both pictures are refutable and could never be used as real evidence.

But I knew she was there, I could smell the strong odor of Ivory soap as she came ever closer to me and I tried to will myself to stay I just couldn't do it, not alone anyway.

I regret chickening out in that room that night. I wish I could of stayed to get better evidence of what was going on in there. But the room was just to horrifying for me to withstand.

One night while my husband and I were watching tv I glanced over and caught a jelly fish like figure with the shape and head of a child peeking around the corner at us. I looked at the figure and then glanced at my husband who was also looking in the same direction! I knew FOR SURE that he saw the same thing that I was looking at but he refuses to admit it to this day!

One other time in broad daylight, my husband and I were in the living room talking about the work that he was doing outside on his car when he wondered out loud ""do you think it's going to rain today?"" and in true Henry fashion and in Henry's ""own"" voice (a voice that I had heard on my recordings before saying the same exact words) the answer came from the other side of the room right out loud and strong it answered ""I don't think so""

This is the only time that I ever heard Henry's voice when it was not in a recording. I gulped and looked right at my husband who was staring right at the spot where the voice came from.

I jumped up and pointed at him ""there"" I said ""I know you heard that, I saw you look""! Nope he said quietly ""heard nothing"" as he backed out of the room and went back to his chores.

Once while cooking dinner I felt this overwhelming urge to take pictures. I just dead stopped what I was doing and grabbed my camera. ***I took some pretty wild red and orange pictures that night with my brand new camera. I never got any other pictures in those colors after that one instance.

Did Henry whisper in my ear that day, in a voice I couldn't really hear but my subconscious did? Did he really pose and let me take pictures of him that night? Was the burst of color all he could muster up? Was that you Henry?

Finally it was December 9th of 2006 the day before the Taps family team was about to arrive. I had left on my recorder in our bedroom that night and had awoken to one of my creepiest evp ever. * In it a man with a mechanical voice says ""my eyes are wide open"" and woman plainly asks ""are you scared?""

Why this evp scares me so much I really don't know, it's not so much different than any of the others, but ever since I first heard this recording I have never put a recorder in the room where we were sleeping again!

Still, I hadn't yet put an end to my strange habit of going out late in the night and taking pictures of my shed.

Yes, I said my shed. There was something going on around that shed day and night! In almost all of my 200+ shed pictures, the roof is always either foggy, cloudy, smoky or covered in orbs.

I soon began to call the roof of the shed the ""hell mouth"" and to this day I believe it had to be some sort of vortex of constant energy transference. The thing seemed to have a life of it's own! Yes, I said my shed. As in ""that nutty lady was out taking pictures of her shed again at 3 am this morning"" that shed.

Once, while I was packing just a few weeks before leaving the cottage, I was suddenly and completely engulfed in a freezing cold hug. I immediately said ""knock that off you're scaring me"" and it stopped at once.

While I may have felt like I was getting used to these things happening around me, deep inside I was still somewhat frightened.

Late one night shortly, before heading to bed I was suddenly overcome with a feeling of loss and sorrow. I thought that I recognized this feeling as artificial, a feeling that was induced by whoever or whatever was haunting the home at moment. But, I turned on my recorder and set it on my shoulder. I asked ""are you Freddy?"" and clears as day and from right beside me his voice whispers softly ""yes I am""

I know that spirits speak in many different voices. I know that this ghostly recording could be just about anybody. But it wasn't anybody. It was truly my dear father, Freddy. I cried for a long time after I heard the recording, even though I am not prone to crying. Even now, hundreds of evp later, this one remains my very favorite.

Today I live in a new home. It is decidedly not haunted. I have stopped recording every moment of every day and I am relieved that I am no longer compelled to do so. Oh I still record when the mood strikes. Because when the mood strikes it is never wrong and I always pick up something from the other side! It is as if someone were whispering in my ear and telling me to go ahead... Start the recorder. Now, a faithful servant of our dearly departed, I will continue to ""start the recorder"" until I am nothing more than an evp myself.

Let me out and then a child laughs.  (takes a second to get to the voices, the noises are also evp)

Stalking Ghost,"California, United States",A Haunted Life,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: A Haunted Life :: Stalking Ghost

I 'm not that new to the web site but I have something also to share with all of you. I have to admit I think I saw a ghost once I'm not sure but I have heard things which are not explainable. I'm 14 now and I started experiencing things when I was about 9 or 10 years old.

I think it all started one night when I just couldn't get to sleep so I just laid in bed thinking about nothing, for some reason I turned my head to see like a little girl curled up into like a ball leaning to the wall. I FREAKED! I quickly closed my eyes, turned the other way, and put the blankets over my head. I slowly started to get sleepy and I never talked about it again.

The next time I was in the bathroom washing my feet, then when I turned up and there was like someone looking though the window. I was so scared that I ran out and slipped because my feet were still wet. I told my mom but like all other parents she didn't believe me. I forgot about it too, until the next time it happened when it did I was using the bathroom which made it even more embarrassing. I ran out and told my dad this time, he did believe me. He got his flash light and I followed him to the back of the house. When we got there, there was no one there, or any foot prints. So I don't know if it was some pervert who covered his footprints with dirt or if it was a ghost.

Well after that I moved, the next time this happened, I went to my grandmas house for like 3 hours, I forgot why though. Well when we came back we heard like this whirring sound coming from the kitchen. My dad went in first and it was the blender that was on. We quickly turned it off and checked if it was hot because if it was, then one of us must have left it on, but it wasn't and no one was home except my dog but he can barely reach the chair.

The next time my mom was trying to open the door of the bathroom when the door forcibly shut from the inside which freaked her out but we excused it as the wind even though it couldn't be stronger than my mom. Well that was then and was 13 when this happened, I went to stay at my grandmas house even though I hate her but my mom was in mexico right now. At 3 in the morning I was awake because I couldn't get to sleep when suddenly I heard foot steps in the kitchen not regular ones. But like someone with high heels and like always I freaked, and went to sleep.

The next thing that happened was about 2 months ago when at like 2 in the morning I went to the bathroom while I was in there I heard foot steps in the kitchen but when I got there there was no one there.

The next thing is when I was laying on my bed when I felt like someone rub their fingers on my back which creeped the hell out of me.

Well this is the last one and this happened like a week ago because I'm 14 now, I was at my aunts house when I was closing the bedroom door when like out of nowhere the door like pushed it self closed. I don't know what's going on but this follows me everywhere I go.

So if someone can please help me with this because I don't know if I did something to make it follow me but its freaking me out, thanks.

Grim Reaper Type of Entity,"West Virginia, United States",Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: Grim Reaper Type of Entity

I n the summer of 1996, I was sharing an apt in Huntington, WV. My roommate and I were having similar experiences but didn't discuss it to each other until I had the scariest moment of my life, supernaturally. What led up to my experience was on different occasions, my roommate and I were having something tapping our feet when we slept.

I was sleeping on the couch downstairs one night after falling asleep watching a late night movie. At the end of the couch where my feet were I kept feeling a thud. Like something was hitting the end of the couch where my feet were. This happened a few times on different late nights. Later, my roommate confided she had something smack her bare feet at night while asleep.

One evening, arriving home after work at the local pawn shop where I was a secretary, I walked into the apt and no one was home. So, I walked through the kitchen where the answering machine was located to check the messages. Something in the apt felt ""off"" to me like something in the room felt ""weird"". Like someone was there even no one was physically ""there"". I can't really put it into words. I checked the machine and had my back turned. All of sudden, something or someone tapped me very hard three times on my right shoulder. Frightened, I didn't dare to turn around. Out of the corner of my eye, I saw what looked like a long bony finger with three raised bony knuckles. The apparition was kind of cartoon-ish in that it was blue and green but real bright. I stood still and really didn't know what to do. Then I heard a voice that haunts me to this day. 'NOBODY'S HOME' it said in a deep guttural angry tone. Calmly, but with the hair on the back of my neck standing up, I walked through the living room and went upstairs to the bedroom and locked the door.

About an hour later, my roommate arrived home. I called down to her in a frightened yet excited voice and told her what happened. Being the accepting ghostly kind of person she is, she believed me and recounted our feet experiences that evening.

To this day, I think about what happened to me and it scares me to death. It never bothered me again and I try not to think about it too much to give it energy to come back for another visit. Whatever it was, seemed very large and very tall. I felt it was about 7 feet tall standing behind me and black. Almost like a grim reaper type of thing. And it felt very evil.

Shoe Lane Ghost,"West Virginia, United States",Apparitions / Voices / Touches,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Apparitions / Voices / Touches :: Shoe Lane Ghost

T his is my 2nd ghost story I've submitted (it seems like I attract ghostly activity ). In September of 2005, I was house-sitting for my aunt who was on vacation. She rents a house in Shepherdstown, WV off of Shoe Lane. The house has 3 apartments in it and the house is very old at least over 100 years old or more.

One night, I was sleeping downstairs and my crazy alcoholic boyfriend kept calling around 3 a.m. getting stupid with me and causing trouble because I was staying there alone. We had a big fight on the phone and I turned the ringer off. There was a phone in the upstairs bedroom and I could hear it ringing. My boyfriend at the time was psycho and kept calling the house. The upstairs bedroom where the other phone is located has an old wood floor that is very distinctive if someone is upstairs walking around. It creaks very loudly.

As I was laying in the dark, hearing the phone ringing upstairs, the phone finally stopped ringing. Then, I heard what sounded like a loud bang! It sounded like a big box or a desk was picked up and thrown to the floor as if to say, ""BE QUIET!"". I got up and stood there and called out, ""Hello?"" Nothing. Then, I listened for a footstep. Like it heard my thought, a creaking step was heard then another. I dared not to walk up the stairs so I got my keys and left.

The next day, I returned and went upstairs to check it out. Nothing was disturbed. Nothing was moved. I got the feeling that the spirit of the house was sick and tired of the disturbing phone calls and was sending out a warning to stop.

Spirit Activity and Major Repairs to a House,"West Virginia, United States",Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: Spirit Activity and Major Repairs to a House

T his is my third submission, currently about where I have lived the last two years. West Virginia has a lot of spirit activity. I rent an apt in a old house built in 1930. The house has 4 apt units. My apt is upstairs and is a small 2 room efficiency. My bedroom leads to the attic upstairs but is blocked off. Most of the apt is modern except for the old thick doorways which must have originally been bedrooms leading to other bedrooms.

It all started last March 07'. I had lived there for about 7 months with nothing strange at all. It was quite nice, for a change! I was pregnant at the time and was relaxing watching t.v. In the bedroom. From my bedroom, a small hallway leads into the kitchen. I felt a presence appear in the hallway. Seconds later, I heard music. I had kept an old music box in the kitchen but hadn't wound it up in years, literally. It just sat there collecting dust.

At first, I wasn't sure what the music was because the t.v. was a little loud. I muted the t.v. after a minute, and walked into the kitchen. Sure enough, the music box was playing and after a few seconds more, it stopped. I smiled feeling as if I had a visit from my deceased mother. Immediately, I called my aunt and told her about my experience.

Days later, I had forgotten about what happened until I was on the phone with her again and the music box began playing. This time I had a witness and I didn't feel like a crazy ghost-attracting lady. She heard the song and identified the song strangely enough being a musician. It played for the longest time and we giggled on the phone together. Someone was visiting, for sure.

Later that summer, my landlord was making major repairs to the house. Days after the work began, I would wake up in the middle of the night and heard long rapping or knocks. I started to hear voices when I walked into the apt as if a conversation was going on. And at night, I would hear a baby whimper or cry in the distance even though my newborn was fast asleep. Strange things happened and I read when major repairs or restoration is done to a house, spirit activity will happen.

It's an old house and has seen a lot of occupants - good energy and bad energy.

A Feeling Something Is Watching Me,"California, United States",Misc,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Misc :: A Feeling Something Is Watching Me

H ello my name is Mel, and what I'm about to tell you has been happening for over half a year. I live in a small town. And a few years ago my parents recently moved to this small town. I sleep in a VERY small room. It actually was a home-office. I've been sleeping in there for around 4 years. I used to be able to sleep soundly with my night-light off.

Some time after my 13th birthday I started getting this feeling that something was watching me. I have always believed in ghosts. But now it feels odd. Like something is watching me... 1 foot away from my bed. Just starring down. This only happens in my room. Usually at night. When I'm getting ready to sleep. I can no longer sleep with out some type of light. So now I sleep with my TV on.

I also feel as if something is watching me when I'm home alone. Again, only in my room. Sometimes it's so bad that I cant even enter my room when I'm home alone. I often feel this way in my room, almost anytime whenever I enter my room. Which scares me.

Another thing that scares me is that sometimes my dog will play with me, then seconds later, run out the house barking like a crazy maniac dog-thing. And for no reason, hell just turn and bark and run out our doggy door. Also, sometimes at night it sounds as if something might be in our attic. But I'm not sure, it might just be rats. Also, if its night time, I cant leave my room once I'm inside it. Because once I open my door I see the window that shows outside (sadly we don't have blinds for it). Every time I open my door at night (rarely), I keep picturing some guy with a shotgun staring at me. It scares me so much, even though I know its just in my mind. No matter how hard I try, I only picture that guy. That also scares me, because around this town there's often people shooting guns.

To this very day, I still get the feeling something is watching me. Sometimes it feels like its going to hurt me. Or its telling me to get out. And sometimes it feels as if its just watching, smiling (which still creeps me out), and waiting in the corner of my room. I feel as if one day I may see the ghost. As if I'll just turn around and it'll be there. Starring at me. And of course, I would scream and run out. The only way I'm getting through this feeling is because I have 2 dogs to protect me.

Any idea if I'm just paranoid? Or maybe I really am being watched... But by what? Could it possibly be a demon? Or just a family member that died long ago? Or just some ghost? A person did just recently die in this town. Could it be him?

Please help me. I am very scared at this point. I can hardly look into a mirror because I'm afraid I might see a ghost of some sort. I haven't done anything that could make a ghost want to haunt me. No ouija boards. No ghost books. I never tried talking to the dead. Is it just me being paranoid?

Haunted Childhood,Canada,A Haunted Life,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: A Haunted Life :: Haunted Childhood

G rowing up it seemed to me that a lot of strange things happened around me, especially in my house. The first really strange experience I had was when I was four or five years old. I was lying in bed, unable to sleep, when I heard a woman start to sing a lullaby. I sat up and looked around, but my room was empty. The only TV in my home was at the other side of the house, so I'm pretty sure that is not what I heard. I don't remember know how the singing made me feel. Although I was so young at the time that I can't be 100% certain that the experience was not a dream, I believe it really happened.

A year or two after that another strange thing happened in my room. When I was young I always slept with a light on. Often I would sleep under my blanket, because I liked the way the light shone through the blanket. One night as I was lying like that, I became certain that someone was sitting beside my bed looking at me. I knew it wasn't one of my parents because my door squeaked when it opened so I would have heard them. As I lay under my blanket I began to think it was a ""grandmother"" in my room. I think that was because I had recently had dreams about my Dad's Mother who died before I was born. After awhile it felt like someone touched my arm through the blanket, then the feeling of being watched disappeared. I stayed under the blanket and fell asleep, but gave my parents a lot of trouble at bedtimes for a long time after.

As I grew up, things always seemed a little ""off"" in my house. My bedroom is at the end of a hallway, the living room is at the other end, and a bathroom is in between the two. Whenever I walked down the hallway to my room, it always felt like someone was behind me, watching from the living room. It never really bothered me during the day when all the lights were on and the sun was shining, but if I ever had to get up in the night to use the washroom after everyone else was in bed and the lights were off, I would be terrified of the presence I felt at the other end of the hall. It was bad enough that until I was about ten, I would have to bring my doll with me. When I was a teenager, and would stay up after my parents, I would still feel as though I was being watched whenever I finally stumbled off to bed.

Most of the events that happened to me as a child were sounds or feelings. I often heard people walking around or the sounds of someone putting something on a table or counter, in areas of the house that were empty. Our kitchen had a screen door that went outside to a porch. This door made a loud ""screeeech"" whenever it was opened or closed. A number of times I heard that noise when there was no one at the door. Once it happened when I was standing right in front of the door so I was able to see for certain there was no one else about. Strangely, this never frightened me like the presence or footsteps did. For some reason I was certain the door noises were ""memories"" of me or a family member from a summer in the past. I don't know if that makes sense or not, just that it didn't feel like a ""real"" thing like the presence in the living room.

If that was all that ever happened to me, I would probably think now that it was an overactive imagination, but the year I went into grade eight, things started to get really weird. That year my friend Annie and I became really interested in ghosts. We would read scary stories, watch scary movies and anything else we could find that had to do with ghosts. A lot of this interest came from the fact we had begun to believe we were being haunted. It started at school. We would be in class and feel icy cold breezes move past us. Sometimes it would only be in a small area, like on a shoulder or the back of your neck. We didn't think much about it until one day Annie came to school and told me ""I was researching ghosts online, and they say cold spots are a sign of ghosts!"" That scared us.

Another day Annie told me she had woken up in the night and at the end of her bed there was a tall, white, glowing figure. Her blankets were also at the end of her bed (it was the middle of summer) but she reached down and pulled them over her head. She said they were freezing. Around the same time, I was sitting in my living room reading. I would read a bit, than look out the window, since I like to watch the birds.

One time when I looked out I saw someone walk behind a tree in my neighbours yard. It wasn't a very big tree so I assumed it must have been my neighbour who is elderly and quite thin. But as I kept watching, the person never walked by the other side from the tree. I haven't been able to find an explanation for it.

Some time after that Annie came to sleep at my place. My family had been renovating our house, so Annie and I slept in the new living room. At the time the only furniture in the room was a couch, a small round table, and a shelf. The couch was in the middle of the room with its back to the doorway (which had no door) and the table was beside the couch. I slept on the floor and Annie slept on the couch. That night, as I was drifting off, I saw some weird things. Every time I looked towards the doorway that went to the rest of the house, it looked like someone was just pulling away. At the time I assumed it was my eyes playing tricks on me since I was so tired. However the next morning Annie asked if my parents had come to check on us in the night. She had heard footsteps coming up to the door, but never heard them leave. That was strange, but what really scared us was the table. The night before Annie had put an almost full cup of water on the table. That morning, the table was upside down on the other side of the room. The cup was empty, on the floor right side up, directly underneath where the table had been. There was no water on the floor, and this was right by my head. Neither of us had been woken up by this.

These strange things kept happening to us until we were around 16-17 and then seemed to calm down. Since reading this site I have noticed it is believed that teenage girls can attract poltergeists. I would like people's opinions on if they think that might have been what happened. Thanks for taking the time to read my long-winded story. If you have questions I'll try to answer them. It may take a day or two though, since I'm coming up to finals and have to study. (And I used to think ghosts were scary!)

A Not So Scary Encounter,United Kingdom,Psychic / Medium,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Psychic / Medium :: A Not So Scary Encounter

H i my name is Skye. Before I start this story, there are one or two things you should know about me and my family. Every woman on my mother's side: that's my great gran, my gran, my mum, auntie, cousin me and my sister and so on can see into the spirit realm. Don't ask why it is only the woman because I have no idea, but non of my male family members on my mother's side can see anything, but they can sense them to some degree.

Now my mum owns a shop all Incentive in the town I live in. It sells things to do with spirits and things like candles and incense sticks. The usual things people like to buy because they smell nice, or look pretty or they really do work. Ever since I was five I have been able to see spirits, ghosts, basically you name it.

One of my short stories of when I was growing up was I used to know this little boy called Simon. Well he told me he was called Simon, I was only little myself remember. I met him in the school yard and would talk to him a lot. None of the other children could see him, at a young age the school even tried to refer me to see a councilor because they were worried, but my mum said I was fine. I didn't understand and thought Simon was a boy, but my mum knew, she could see him to. I will always remember Simon, he was the first spirit I talked to. I found out later from my mum that he had died in a World War Two bombing and he had come to the school because he liked it there.

One day I was sat talking to this boy Simon and he said he was glad I was his friend, but he had to go. I was really sad and started to cry, but Simon told me that I had nothing to worry about and that I would see him again some day when I was ready to. Because I was little I didn't know what that meant, but I told him that I was going to miss him and that I would never forget him.

Later on that day, when I was leaving school, I saw Simon waving to me, like he was saying goodbye. I turned to my mum and told her Simon was my friend and that he was going today.

My mum gave me a smile and told me that he was glad to have me as a friend, but he was ready to cross over. I didn't fully understand what that meant then, but my response to that was ""When he comes back can he come for tea?"" When I asked that my mum laughed and said the same thing as Simon. I would see him again one day when I was ready.

I nodded and turned to wave to Simon, but he had gone. I cried all the way home, sad to have lost my friend.

Now I understand who Simon was and I truly miss him, I hope where ever Simon is he is happy and at peace at last, I am only glad that I was there to help him on his way. My mum later told me that Simon only wanted a friend to talk to. But I kept my promise and to this day I remember Simon, partly the reason why I am posting this story.

I still help spirits to try and cross over when I can, I want to help all of them like I did with Simon. But those tales are stories for another time.

I hope we can all look at this story as an example that not all spirits are bad and some just want a friend to talk to.

Pinching and Slapping,"Kentucky, United States",Apparitions / Voices / Touches,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Apparitions / Voices / Touches :: Pinching and Slapping

T his is a true story when I was in 6th grade last year, that my friends and I all experienced. I was not the only one. It was almost the last day of school, and it was after my field trip was over. 2 of my best friends was talking to each other like usual, until one of my friends (A) started to feel pain on her arms. A said it felt like someone was pinching her. Then it started hurting on her legs too. But I was watching, and no one was around her doing such a thing. Suddenly my other friend (B) started to feel the same pain. They would jump and scream and start slapping where it hurts to see if they catch anything. Finally, a little pinch startled me on my arm, but yes, there was no one.

Finally the pain stopped, and when I looked at my friends, they were covered in red marks and nail marks. On B's arm there even was a bite mark, and on A's leg there was a hand mark! I had only one pinch on my arm though. Then suddenly, ""My back feels heavy..."" A started moaning and started to lean down, as if something was really on top of her. Then I can't even believe it, but for a second, I saw that boy from the Magic Kingdom laughing, pushing her down with great force. I screamed, but the bell interrupted. A, B, and I ran down the stairs screaming, as we felt as if something cold touched our necks. A started crying. B screamed in terror. I pulled them outside. We finally made it, and then, we didn't feel anything.

A and B were in terror, and they were shaking. I stared in space, trying to remember what just happened. Everything just turned back to normal all of a sudden, and I lost my trait of thought. ""We should go now..."" B cried and waved goodbye. I did too, but I stopped in horror. That same boy stared at me, and waved from A's back. I was too scared to tell her, but I told B on the phone. That was one of the most terrifying thing that ever happened to me.

Now, thankfully the boy never pops up, but B is very sick, and she says it is kind of like a cancer. I am worried. I am also wondering if it might be that boy's fault. Also, did I tell you that the next day after that, A missed school because she got sick... Pretty weird.

Was It the Ghost of a Miner?,"Arizona, United States",Apparitions / Voices / Touches,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Apparitions / Voices / Touches :: Was It the Ghost of a Miner?

A t the end of this past March, my sister, her boyfriend, my husband and I took a trip to Bisbee, Arizona for a weekend of camping. Bisbee was known as a mining town throughout the Southwest in the late 1800s. The Copper Queen mine opened up in the 1880s and the town became populated almost overnight with miners, saloon owners, and ladies of the evening. A lot of the original miner's cabins are still standing and there are quite a few stone foundations left from the ones that have crumbled. These foundations dot the hillside like a rugged constellation.

In 1975 this mine closed for good ending an era that more often than not, contained three or more generations of people that had worked there. When the miners moved out, the artists and hippies moved in creating a laid-back, fun and historical place to visit and shop.

After an afternoon of sightseeing, the four of us returned to our campsite that was stationed directly to the left of the Copper Queen Mine. There are tours that still take place in this now defunct mine and to give you an idea of how close we were to the mine, we had to cut through the mine's parking lot to get to our campsite. After enjoying s'mores and some music, we decided to all turn in for the night. My sister and her boyfriend slept in a tent, and my husband and I turned in to our camper. I had left the door unlocked just incase my sister and her boyfriend might need anything during the night. I often read before going to bed and did so this night before I started to get tired and decided to turn off the lights.

While waiting for sleep to come, I heard the camper door open and someone come in. I didn't open my eyes assuming it was my sister's boyfriend that had forgotten something inside. I heard the footsteps walk to the end of the camper, back again, and then the door opened and closed. It sounded like a man wearing heavy boots. I fell asleep and didn't think much more about it.

In the morning I asked both my sister and her boyfriend what they had forgotten in the camper the night before. They both looked at me blankly and said that they both had gone right to sleep after turning in. I asked them if they were sure and they both said yes, they were sure. My husband is also the type that will fall asleep within 10 seconds of closing his eyes so he didn't hear it either. So if everyone was asleep than who or what had walked through the camper? Could it have been the ghost of a miner that was checking us out? I have no idea. I do know that I was completely awake and I had not been drinking.

Thoughts? Another thing was that this 'person' did not turn on any lights. It was pitch black in there. They also walked in and walked out. I was expecting to hear a bag unzip but it was only the footsteps.

I've attached a picture of Bisbee. The town is literally carved into the hillside. If you look across to the mountain, there is a cave in the wall. Although you can't really see it, the campground and Queen Mine entrance is located to the lower left of that mountain.

House 300,"Texas, United States",Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: House 300

T o make this story easier to follow there are a few things you need to know. My friend Ashlyn, who goes by Ash, is the one that lives close to this house, not me. She also gets scared super easy. And then there's me, I'm Julie; I love scary things, the harmless kind. And I spend a lot of time at Ash's so we go by this house a lot.

Now you're probably wondering what the house I'm talking about is. Me and my friends know it as house 300. Or the creepy house on Ash's block. Or the haunted hazard.

This story starts in the middle of the year in the sixth grade, when I was twelve. My brother just started driving so he could pick me up from school so I wouldn't have to ride the bus. So eventually I got bored of waiting 43 minutes for my brother to come pick me up and me and Ash came up with an idea. Walk with her to her house hang there a bit and walk back to the school. That way I would only have to wait 13 minutes.

I agreed to this idea very quickly, so everyday after school we would walk down to Ash's house. Everyday after school, we would have to walk by the house, house 300. Now at the time I thought nothing of this house. To me it was just an old abandoned house with a bunch of made up ghost stories based on it.

So one cold winter day me and Ash where walking to her house and I decided to walk up on to the porch of house 300 and look inside the windows. Ash reluctantly followed me up the gravel drive way and up the steps.

I looked inside one of the broken windows and saw something move ""Dude! Ash! Look, look! There's something in there!"" I yelled. She looked and a cat came out the window. She almost fainted. I laughed because it was funny, so I told her we could leave.

On the very edge of the lot I looked back and there was the cat, just standing there. I laughed again and we went back to Ash's.

She turned towards me and told me this. ""Don't you see? No cats live around here, there are way to many dogs! And that cat, I remember one just like it starved to death on that porch!""

Now after hearing that all the color drained from me. ""So what are you saying?"" I asked her. Then she told me this story. When she was younger, before she met me she would always ride her bike around the block and one time she got off her bike to fix her chain in front of that house. She looked up at the front door and saw an old man with a cane smiling and waving at her in a kind way. She smiled and waved back. Then she got on her bike and looked back and the man was gone. There was no way he could have moved that quickly! She got on in less than a second!

So after hearing this story I was very reluctant to go by that house to get back to school. But I had to, so I bundled up in my cote and left her house. I walked quicker than normal today and soon enough I was going by that house again. I looked in one of the windows and saw a black mass, darker than everything around it. I ran, no not ran, sprinted away from that house and back to the school as fast as I could.

The weekend came and passed and soon it was Monday again. And I was dying to tell someone what happened. So I told my good fearless friend Tristen everything. He told me that he would check it out this weekend and he would find out what was up.

The rest of the week was boring and un eventful so let's skip to next Monday. By then I was wanting to know what happened so as soon as I got the chance I asked him and he told me his story. After going into the house, through one of the windows, he looked around, it was really dusty and all the furniture was covered by a white cloth. He chuckled seeing no reason why we girls would be afraid. He gave the inside one more scan and came across a pair of glowing yellow eyes. He said he thought it was just a cat or rats eyes.

And at this point I interrupted him, ""Tristen cats eyes and rats eyes don't glow...""

After realizing this he went pale and we never spoke of that house again. Until I brought it up when I was sleeping over at Ash's, but that's a whole other story.

The House,"Ohio, United States",Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: The House

I have had experiences with the paranormal since I was five. Now, I am a mother of two adult daughters, and I am almost forty years old (not counting the months). I have had experiences with the paranormal since I was five. It is a favorite pastime for my children to have me share my experiences with them and their friends. After reading a continuing post on Your Ghost Stories, I have decided to write about mine in the same fashion. I will start with my most vivid memory rather than the earliest, which is the first incident of many in one of the houses that I lived in as an adolescent.

When I was thirteen my mother remarried, and we all three moved into a large three story home in Columbus, Ohio. We were all excited to be moving in to start our new family. Built in the early 1900's it had 2400 hundred square feet of living space, not including the full basement. The style had the influence of the larger Victorian homes not far from this West side area, which was most noticeable in the porch with decorative hand carved wooden slats of the banister wrapping around a quarter of the house. It was built of wood, covered in white slats of wood siding. On the side of this porch which wrapped around there were two entrances. The first went into the living room, and four feet down was the other entrance to the foyer. Once inside a person could enter the largest room of the house from either room; the huge kitchen. From the kitchen a person could fine a backdoor leading to a double lot sized backyard, and then on the opposite side of that door was the door leading to the cold damp stone basement. The living room presented the narrow rickety stairway upstairs to the bedrooms. The first door to the left of the small 48 by 48 landing was my parent's room. Once in their room was yet another door leading up to the full attic.

This is where I had a scary visit, on the very first day that we moved in. All of the furnishings were moved in, and the beds were set up to sleep in. My step dad went to pick up pizza, and I was helping my mom unpack boxes in her room. When I got to a stack of three boxes near the attic door, she told me not to unpack them, but instead told me I could carry them upstairs into the attic.

With the typical reluctance of a teenager I headed up the stairs carrying the smallest box about 24"" by 24"". I remember thinking that the stairs were smaller and had less depth than any other stairs I had climbed. The instant that I stepped onto the floor landing, I felt a presence. I am not sure how to explain it, but it felt eerie, and was accompanied by the chills or goose pimples. Setting the box down, I felt more fear as the sense of the presence became stronger. Although I was scared and part of me wanted to run, it was more than that. I also felt an urge to leave, but it was in external push only I it felt internally. It was more than just an instinct and my reaction to fear. Something or someone was wishing me away, imploring me. Bewildered, I quickly headed back down the steps.

I told my mom something weird was up there, but she thought I was trying to get out of working. She told me to take the other boxes up, and then she would listen to me. With even more reluctance I heaved the second larger box up the stairs, but this time as fast as I could move, so I could get it done as fast as I could. On the way up I heard my mother order me to set the box back away from the steps, to leave a walk way for more things to put up there.

Reaching the landing once again, I felt those chills again, this time to the bone, and the presence of the entity was still there. I could feel it urging me away, warning me like an invisible force field. I felt like I was invading, but I assured myself, that nothing was there, and to just set the box down, and go get the last one. I took two steps into the attic room. Setting the second box down, and pushing it back a bit, I heard a loud swoop. In an instant I felt an apparition breeze pass by me. Reactively, I closed my eyes and raised my arms to cover my head. Opening my eyes I frantically scanned the room. In the far corner, I spotted the entity. Appearing like a shadow, but with form, it began swooping phantomlike here and there, in two swoops from one end of the attic to the other. Of course, I swooped too, in one leap to the bottom of the stairs, screaming, ""MOM!"" I slammed the door to the attic shut.

Immediately, she asked me what was wrong, and I told my mom what had happened, and she said it was probably just a bird. I told her there was no rustling of feathers, and that I saw a shadow like thing. She said it was more likely a bat. I could see that she was concerned. However, she told me, that I was letting my mind play tricks on me. I completely refused to go back up there, no matter how long I was grounded. She stated to go up, but I begged her not to. I told her it looked a little like the boogie man I saw when I was little. She stopped in her tracks as I saw the look of recollection of that event on her face. She said she would have dad go up there when he got back. We lived there for two years, but I never went up there again. There were other events that happened in that house, but I will leave those events and the boogie man visit to another time.

Kimberly Street,"North Carolina, United States",Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: Kimberly Street

F or those of you who read my first story about the house on Kimberly Street , that was only about my house. I posted a comment that stated it was not just the house, but my street as a whole that had activity.

My friend that lived across the street, Amy, she also had things happen in her house as well. I was over there one afternoon and we were sitting in her living room watching TV. All of a sudden what looked like a hand slammed into the window across from us. We both screamed at the same time and went running out the door. We stopped in the front yard and thought maybe it was just a bird, upon further examination, no bird or feathers could be found in front of that window.

As I stated in my first story, there were a lot of kids for us to play with and there were a lot of teenage boys that lived in the neighborhood too. We put a volleyball net up in our yard and every Sunday almost the whole neighborhood would be over there to play. We would cook out on the grill and different people would bring different things. Amy had gone home to get something out of her room on one of these Sundays and all of a sudden we heard her scream. At the same time that she screamed, her basement light turned on. About 5 of the teenage boys went running over there to make sure she was ok. By the time they ran across the street she had run from up stairs and was half way through her yard. When they asked her what was wrong, all she said was that someone was in her house. Upon them immediately going into her house and searching, they found nothing but the basement light on.

My parents went out of town for the night and I decided to stay with my friend Wendy. She lived on the ""main"" street that you turned off of to get to my street. We played about all day, ate that evening, took a bath and we were getting ready for bed. All of a sudden I got this terrible pain in my stomach and was just so nauseous. Her dad tried everything that they had and nothing was working. At about 2am, I called my next door neighbor, Donna, and asked her if I could come to her house for the night because I was so sick. She agreed and told me she would open the kitchen door and cut on the light for me so, off I went through the yard.

When I got beside Wendy's house, there was a huge butterfly bush and it started shaking violently. I'm not talking about a bird or squirrel moving in the bush, I mean shaking to the point that blooms and leaves were falling to the ground by the handfuls. I ran as fast as I could through the yard and across the street to Donna's house where she was waiting for me in the kitchen. When I ran through the door, out of breath, she asked what was wrong and I told her. She told me it was just my imagination and for me to lay down on the sofa and go on to sleep.

I don't know whether it was the shock of the bush or being out of Wendy's house, but when I finally caught my breath I was no longer sick to my stomach. So there you go, another experience on Kimberly Street. I hope you enjoyed and like always, thank you for reading!

Weird Days Forever,Armenia,Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: Weird Days Forever

I have moved almost a million times, this time it just got scarier. Everywhere I am, strange things happen. It's like someone's been following me my whole life. When I just moved into a house after getting married, this house was pretty creepy.

One day I was home alone, taking care of my kiddies, when all of a sudden my baby starts crying. I come into the room and it is freezing cold. So I brought my child with me. In like a split second in the living room, it got freezing almost 50 degrees. So I flip on the tv. All is well. Few hours later, I'm in the kitchen cooking, husband still at meeting, just me and the baby, the tv turns off. I know that wasn't her. She's sleeping. My dog is in the kitchen with me. Then I heard footsteps upstairs and my dog stacie starts growling. I hear my piano playing upstairs. Next goes the light, but I lit candles. So I call my husband but the phone's dead. It was six thirty and thank god he was coming home in ten minutes. That seemed like four hours which was. He was caught in Traffic! Nice.

Later, the piano stopped and that's when I start crying on and on. I was to shocked to run out of the house in complete horror, when I can tell someone is staring at me. I get a very hard slap out of nowhere on the face. Someone's needs to see a doctor I said. That made the ghost very mad. I could feel anger everywhere when all of a sudden the lights turned on, the candles blew out, tv turns on, it gets warmer and my husband comes in.

One look at me and Stacie and he could tell something was wrong. But every time I'm home alone now, it's like a nice spirit entered the house.

One Last Time,"Nevada, United States",Family / Friends Visits,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Family / Friends Visits :: One Last Time

O n Christmas day 2006 I got a phone call that sunk my heart. It was my mother informing me that my Grandmother had passed away early that morning in her Henderson Nevada home. I was living at the time in Southern California, only about 2 1/2 hours away from her. My wife and I went about our Christmas morning rituals of breakfast, then presents. After all the presents where opened we left the kids with my mother-in-law and headed for Nevada.

The mood was very somber at my grandmothers home. Everyone tried to be up-beat, telling stories etc... But we were all very down. The whole day I had this strong feeling that I needed to see her one last time. The feeling was so strong that I couldn't let it go. She was going to be cremated the next day. My grandfather had made it very clear that he wanted no one to ""bother her"", as he put it, so I had my mother arrange a special viewing just for me before she was cremated.

I got to the funeral home at about 4pm on Dec. 26, and was greeted by a very nice man who led me to a small chapel on the property. Inside was totally empty except for my Grandmothers body lying on stretcher at the foot of the pulpit. I know this whole deal may sound strange to some, but, if you have ever lost some one you loved (by the way, my Grandmother and I were extremely close) then you can understand that you need some form of closer, and for me I felt I needed to see her one last time.

The man led me to the end of the pews and respectfully put his head down and crossed his arms. I felt like I floated the rest of the way to her, almost like it was a dream and none of this was real. I remember shedding a few tears and kissing her forehead, when, as clear as day I heard my name being called from behind me. I turned to look over my right shoulder, and there was my Grandmother, sitting on the first pew smiling at me. I was so shocked that I couldn't speak. I remember looking over at the gentleman who had brought me there, hoping that he was seeing the same thing I was, but he was still looking at the floor with his hands crossed respectfully. I remember looking back at her and she was still there. A sudden feeling of love and warmth overtook me and tears streamed down my face. I knew she was in a better place and that she would be watching over me. After what seemed like a very long time she was suddenly gone. I told the gentleman thank you and left.

To this day I'm not really sure if it was all just a figment of my imagination or she really was there with me. I like to believe that she was.

Shadow People and a Spirit,Canada,A Haunted Life,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: A Haunted Life :: Shadow People and a Spirit

W hat happened the last Wednesday night of April, 2008, I will never forget. For starters I will give some background. My girlfriend, Sara, lives with her friend, Jen, in a house. (Names have been changed for protection.) Jen owns the house and has for almost two years. Jen has a very good paying job, is single, and has chosen to pay off the large mortgage faster than is necessary. She is also injured, is unable to work, and so she doesn't get much per month for compensation. On top of all that she is unhappy about work, constantly worries about her life, and exercises, often pushes herself to extreme. She is good person, though, and we all love her.

Her family is of Ukrainian heritage and they go to Ukraine sometimes and it was there, years ago, that Jen brought back with her a spirit of a little girl who looks to have died in the famine of the 1930s in Ukraine. (For more information look up ""Stalin, 1930s Ukrainian famine"".) This little girl visits Jen in her dreams on a regular basis and it is always a calm dream and never bad or uncomfortable. Lately the spirit has materialized in solid form - both times in the form of my girlfriend.

Wednesday night I was sleeping over at my girlfriend's place. We went to bed at 10pm and fell asleep quickly, as usual. At 12:30 am we were suddenly awoken by Jen screaming outside Sara's room in the basement. She was screaming ""Sara! Sara!"" over and over again. Sara put on her robe and I quickly followed to see that Jen was on the ground rocking back and forth and saying to herself (or us) ""I don't know, I don't know"" over and over again. We asked her many times what happened and Jen would alternate between the words ""ice ice ice"", ""I don't know, I don't know"" and ""thaw thaw thaw"". From her one or two word sentences we found out that she had seen something in her room that frightened her.

The phrase ""I don't know"" referred to that she didn't know why she had seen these things. The word ""ice"" meant that she was cold all over. And the word ""thaw"" referred to the fact that she felt like she was thawing. When she was cold she grabbed her Bible and held it close to her stomach. At that point in her body, she felt the Bible warm her from the inside and her insides grow warmer and warmer therefore feeling like a thaw.

At this point we were able to calm her down just enough as to find out what she saw. We were able to guess from our questions and her nods and shakes of her head (and talking to her afterwards) that she was not able to get to sleep last night, as usual. She closed her eyes and, after laying there for a half hour thinking with all her thoughts, she felt something evil in her room. She opened her eyes to see five small shadow people, about 4 feet tall, beside her bed. They had eyes of some sort and small white jagged teeth. She also saw the spirit of the little girl up above her and she described the girl's expression as unhappy and looking at the shadows. Jen was terrified and she crouched toward her headboard as the five shadow people got closer. Then, without warning, the spirit of the little girl waved her arm from outside to inside and threw Jen off her bed and Jen ran out.

Jen called her sister in a panic but her sister didn't recognize the voice on the other side but stayed on just because she was concerned for who ever this was. Jen tried to run a bath to calm down and talk but couldn't do either and she collapsed by the bath tub. Jen hung up the phone and was able to crawl to the downstairs landing and run downstairs screaming for Sara.

After calming Jen down she was not out of the woods yet. She was still very terrified and would take in air but not breathe out - she was ventilating improperly. She would pass out for a 5-15 seconds without breathing out. We decided to take Jen to the hospital but she refused to go and certainly did not want to go in an ambulance. We told her either we drive her or she goes in an ambulance. The hospital was not far but Jen did not want people to stare at her in the waiting room for fear of them thinking she was crazy. The waiting room had only 5 people in it but we took a spot outside that area anyways because we didn't want her getting worse. We tried to calm Jen down but her breathing was getting worse and she was holding her breath longer and longer.

After 30 minutes in the waiting room, Jen did not exhale and her eyes rolled back into her head. She was rushed to the resuscitation room and security asked me to wait in the waiting room while Sara held her hand. Jen was unresponsive to anyone and anything including pain (pinch, sternum press, etc.) They were able to get her breathing normally again but she was still unresponsive. My girlfriend had a University final in the morning the next day and could not stay with her all night. I came in and sat with Jen while Sara got some granola bars and water for me. While I was with Jen, she kept looking at something on the ceiling. You could see her eyes shift to a point, fixate, and then look somewhere else again. She fidgeted, took the breathing tube out of her nose, took her hair tie out, too, but still would not fixate on my eyes or respond when I called her name. When Sara and I discussed her ""mama"" she stirred more than normal, a sign to me that she was might be able to hear us but not respond.

Sara left for the water and food. I talked to Jen and told her she would be alright. When she stirred and looked up and near me I got up and put my face in front of hers and called her name but her eyes did not fixate on me at all. She stayed in that condition for 2 hours. Finally, I began to talk to her in Ukrainian. I told her these words ""God sees you and he sees everything. God is here..."" That is all I said. I looked down and then toward the door. Jen stirred and I looked back to see that she was blinking her eyes. She was awake!

Jen was fine after that but she didn't sleep much that night and only on the couch. She was diagnosed with something. Plainly stated, instead of anxiety attacks these attacks are how her body reacts to too much anxiety - it over reacts.

For a person with feet in both worlds - science and spirituality - I can see, medically, how this is true. We didn't dare tell the doctor what she told us about the shadow people and we certainly told the nurses many times that she did not take drugs. I put Jen's fears to rest saying that seeing shadow people does not make her crazy and, in fact, it is almost normal to see them. Listening to podcasts and reading has opened me to know that there are many types of shadow people encounters.

I would not have believed this story had I not seen it for myself. If you need verification about this story there is Sara, though I doubt Jen would want to talk about this anymore than she already has. The doctor and many others have either prescribed or agreed, that Jen needs therapy to deal with things in her life.

Many questions remain unanswered for me like, why did the girl's spirit throw Jen out of bed? I am afraid if the spirit of the little girl is able to take the form of Sara and knock Jen out of bed, what else can or will it do? What if the girl is not really a spirit but a devil in disguise since it has the ability to change forms? What about the five small shadow people in her room? Now that they know where Jen is and how she reacts, will they be back? And if so, how soon? What about the Bible warming her up from the inside? And the fact that I mentioned God and seconds later she wakes up from her state? Was this some kind of possession?

We all hope and pray that Jen goes to see a therapist to deal with the repressed emotions in her life. If this is how her body reacts to extreme fear then excess fear should be eliminated. Still this event has Jen encountering a spirit, shadow people and possibly a demon. After all the podcasts and reading I have done on these subjects, what, in the realm of the supernatural, is possible after this event?

Haunted Motorcycle Shop,"California, United States",Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: Haunted Motorcycle Shop

A s some of you know from reading my previous stories, I have just recently moved to Los Angeles with my fiancé and little brother. And you would also know about the new houses I have lived in, I am currently living in, and the things that have taken place in those houses. Well, I guess that isn't enough for me, because I have to deal with them at work now.

I am a mechanic at a very popular and very busy motorcycle shop (That cannot be named). Everyday, myself and 6 other guys pull through maybe 25 plus bikes in a 10-11 hour day. That doesn't seem like much, but we don't just do repairs, we also do custom paint jobs, and other custom jobs, so it's quite time consuming. So in other words... It's ridiculously busy and we don't have time to mess around. However, someone seems to have the time to pull pranks on us.

This past Monday (May 5) was busy as hell. The showroom was having a huge sale and for some reason the owner thought we should have a sale on a few things in the shop. Which was retarded because, as I said, it was busy as hell.

It was around noon, and I decide to take an hour and go to Jack in the box. When I got back to my work area, all of the drawers on my toolbox were open and every single one of my sockets were scattered across the floor. I yelled over at Rod and told him if he needs to borrow something, not to make such a mess. (I used a little more colorful words though, because I was not too impressed.) He told me he wasn't even near my bench, he was doing airbrush the whole morning.

Well the pranks went on for the rest of the day... Nothing as bad as before, just missing tools, and I would turn around to find that drawers were open when I knew they were closed.

Finally it was time to close up for the night. Since I am the manager of the maintenance department, I have to stay an hour after everyone has left to do invoices and what not. I was at my bench pricing out a few things a customer wanted when I heard someone coughing. It was coming from the long hallway at the rear of the shop that leads to the dumpsters. A special code is needed to open that door, and can only be opened from the inside. Plus it makes a very annoying creak followed by a loud slam when it is opened. So I was a little shaken to find no one there when I went to check it out.

I walked down the corridor to go see if the door was propped open at all. Nope, closed tight. I just turned around to head back to my bench when I heard the coughing sound again. Only this time it was coming from the shop. I jogged down the hall and into the shop to see who was there... No one.

This is when I just stood there and went... ""Great, now I have to deal with them at work too..."" I went over to my bench where I had left my invoices (Which were very important and needed to be put into the computer right away) and they were missing. I gave up. I had had enough, so I grabbed my coat and left. Didn't finish sweeping, didn't power wash the floors... nothing.

I got home and told my fiancé and brother about what happened. Chris thought this was hilarious because he usually gets all of the annoying ghosts pulling pranks on him. So he got his little cheap shots in and that was it.

The next day I got to work, and when I turned on the shop lights I could NOT believe my eyes. Everyone's tools were spilled all over the floor and a hose, that I had rolled up nice and neat before I left was pulled out, with water pouring out of it. Finally I had enough so I started yelling at the spirit. After yelling at it I began cleaning up the tools and putting them back where they belonged. As I was cleaning I swear I heard a very mischievous chuckle coming from the corridor.

""Yeah,"" I said ""Hilarious! I'm having the time of my life over here... So funny..."" Basically sounding like a retard. If someone came down and saw me arguing with... nobody... I'm sure that would have looked a little weird.

The rest of the day wasn't that bad, until closing time came and I was alone again. I started to smell the faint smell of a cigarette. I followed the smell to, you guessed it, the corridor leading to the dumpsters. And... yup, you guessed it again... NOTHING! I turned back to my area to finish sweeping and I noticed at the corner of my eye, the missing invoices from the previous day were neatly stacked on my workbench. I leaned on my broom and smiled. I guess I finally got through to the spirit, and he felt bad or something. Since last week, nothing out of the ordinary has happened. Other then a power outage that happened when two other mechanics got into a yelling match... Was the spirit angry that they were arguing? I dunno, I'm just going to say it was a coincidence.

H i everyone. I haven't updated anything in a long time. Busy and the page is always down when I get the chance to write. But here is what's been happening. This happened to me only a few hours ago. I was walking from my bus stop to my house which I would say is a good quarter mile. I kept getting this weird feeling like something was watching me. Well wait let me back track to last month. I went to a concert that I shouldn't have. There was a lot of hate and death thoughts. At the concert I saw two very tall figures staring at me. They followed me home and joined my beast in tormenting me.

So back to today. I could feel a pressure all around me which hurt at times and was like suffocating. I got to my house and no one was there. I don't like being home alone much anymore because my experiences happen most often when I'm alone.

I had to go on my computer to work some things out for school so I was sitting there when I heard someone calling my name. It was a whisper at first but it grew louder calling, ""FREE US FREE US FREE US..."" I didn't know what us was. Then my beastly voice broke into call this calling. He laughed his normal hideous laugh and said ""are you going to free them...Tiersa?"" I couldn't take anymore and ran out of the computer room but stopped in the hallway. The beastly one was at the end of the hallway. He was facing the front door so his side was to me.

My room is next to the computer room so I backed up slowly so he wouldn't see me and hurt me or anything. There is also a mirror at the end of my hallway. I saw three figures in it. One of my beastly fellow and two from the concert. I hid in my room until I heard the front door open. I jumped up and looked to see if anyone was home but no one way. I figured one of them must had opened the door.

Michael suddenly came to mind I called out to him. ""Michael please make them leave, make them just go away..."" I heard heavy breathing on the other side of my bedroom door and then it was silent. I could hear the rain falling but it wasn't raining. And I can still hear ""Free Us"" in my head.

Does anyone think that is weird, I could hear the rain falling but it wasn't raining? Does anyone have any suggestions on what I should do about my new comers. I've tried to use the dirt/sand salt and water thing but that isn't working now. It's getting out of control now. I really need some help!

Ghost of a Dog,Canada,Pets / Animals,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Pets / Animals :: Ghost of a Dog

A bout 2 months before I was born, my parents got a puppy. He was a black lab named bear. When I was born, Bear and I connected immediately. He would always lay beside my crib at night, and sit by the tub when my parents would bathe me. Once I started crawling, Bear would be right on my heels, making sure I wouldn't get hurt.

As I grew up, Bear became my best friend. I didn't have any friends growing up because I was a Christian. I would get beat up every day pretty much and when I came home Bear was there at the door wagging his tail. We would spend every hour we could together. When my brother was born, Bear didn't want anything to do with him... He was my dog I guess, and he made that very clear.

Time went on, and as I got older, so did Bear. On my tenth birthday, bear became very sick. It was right in the middle of my party, my dad came inside with Bear in his arms and said, ""Steph (my mom) can you take these kids home, and meet me and Marshall at the vet?""

I looked at Bear, very confused. He was foaming at the mouth, and breathing really weird. Of course I know now that he was having serious convulsions. Wow even thinking about it now shakes me up... sorry... anyways, I ran to the front door and put on my shoes and my dad and I got in his truck and headed to the pet hospital. I remember looking down at Bear's poor lifeless body as we drove to the vet. He was still breathing, and his eyes looked glazed over and grey.

The vet took him in right away and told my dad and I that we would have to leave him overnight so they could do some x-rays and other tests. I didn't sleep at all that night, I couldn't stop thinking about my buddy.

The next day we went to the vet first thing in the morning. The vet told my parents he had a brain tumor that was causing hemorrhaging and they were going to do their best to save him. A week past and bear wasn't making any progress. The vet said we could take him home for the day, as it would be his last. At the time I didn't know it was his last day. To be honest I thought he was better and he was home to stay. We took him out in the back yard, and I laid there with him on a blanket and talked to him. I remember saying ""No matter what happens, I'll always love you..."" I was so happy that I was bonding with him again.

The next day was probably one of the worst days of my life. I woke up and went to the kitchen where Bear's bed was... It was empty. I asked my mom where he was and my mom sat me down and told me my dad took him to the vet to have him put down.

I totally broke down... I was a mess, I was confused, I thought he was better. That's why he was home right!?

The next day we had a little funeral service for him in our back yard. We planted a small tree and a bunch of little flowers. Then we buried his favorite bone and spread his ashes.

I laid awake that night... crying. I was heart broken. Absolutely heart broken. I got up to get a cup of water from the kitchen. When I turned on the light I looked over to Bear's old bed... And there he was. Well his spirit anyway. He was holding his bone (the one we had buried) and wagging his tail very happily. He dropped his bone on the floor, it didn't make a sound. He nudged it forward as if to say ""Play with me buddy!"" I walked over to grab the bone and then he and the bone disappeared. I fell to my knees and broke down hysterically. My parents came rushing into the kitchen to help me up. They let me sleep in their room for the rest of the night.

Every once in a while, it doesn't matter which house I'm living in, I will sometimes see Bear wagging his tail... Just telling me that he's still there and that we'll be reunited again.

Writing this story was really hard for me. It's hard losing a pet... Especially when you become so close.

Is She Gone?,"California, United States",Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: Is She Gone?

I t's been a week since we've had any activity in our house. My fiancé hasn't heard any strange noises from the main floor bathroom, and I haven't had any problems with my electronics turning on or off.

But my brother has been telling me a few things that have given me reason to believe the little girl that haunts or haunt (ed) has not left yet.

Last weekend I told the spirit that she couldn't stay anymore. I told her that she needed to be with Jesus, and that if she asked for forgiveness and asked Jesus to save her, she would be free. I haven't noticed anything out of the ordinary over the past few days, so I figured I managed to get her to cross over.

The past few nights, my brother Chris says that he has woken up to find a little girl standing in the doorway of his room. He isn't sure if he was imagining it, because he was so tired, and he didn't know if he was a wake or dreaming... But he says it is creepy none the less.

I found this to be quite interesting so I asked him if I could bunk with him for the night and see if I experienced the same thing.

Last night is a night that I will remember for a long time. I slept on his floor, and at about 2:40am, I was wide awake. Chris was too because a few moments after my eyes shot open. Chris, very questionably said my name. Almost as if he knew I was awake... But didn't know for sure... If that makes any sense at all. I told him I was awake. We thought this was weird, waking up at the exact same time. Before I woke up I had a dream I was in the basement, not doing anything, just standing there. Chris says he had the same dream.

We couldn't help ourselves, we had to go down to the basement to see what the hell was so significant about it. When we got to the main floor we felt the temperature drop quite a bet, and we heard the basement door creak, we looked at each other and went around the corner to the basement door. We always shut the door before bed and it was wide open now. We went downstairs, pretty scared, and when we got to the bottom we saw something on the floor. We couldn't quite make it out so Chris turned the light on.

On the middle of the basement floor there was a pile of 3 or 4 daisies, and a small wooden cross that laid on top of it. Chris and I looked at each other, quite confused. And Chris shook his head, said ""F*** this..."" and went back to bed.

I stayed down there to try and figure out what was going on. I grabbed a chair, sat down and stared at the flowers on the floor. I stared and stared, until I saw a shadow out of the corner of my eye. I looked up, and there was the girl... She had become comfortable enough to show herself to me! I was so excited. I smiled at her and asked her if she was leaving us. And honest to God, she smiled, and lifted her hand up and started to wave, but then she disappeared completely. I was happy, but quite overwhelmed at what had just happened.

I knew this was her way of saying goodbye, I knew she was off to a better place. I went back to his room and got into my sleeping bag. Chris asked me what took so long, I told him nothing and fell right to sleep.

This morning after I woke up, I went down into the basement to grab the daisies and the cross. I took them outside and planted the daisies in a little spot in the garden, then stuck the cross into the dirt right behind them. I felt a little sad, because this girl had become almost like a friend in a way. She would always want me to play ball with her and play all kinds of funny pranks on my brother. It's going to be tough not having her around. But it's a good thing for her to be where she belongs.

Shadow People and Webby Encounter,"North Carolina, United States",Old Hags / Night Attacks / Sleep Paralysis,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Old Hags / Night Attacks / Sleep Paralysis :: Shadow People and Webby Encounter

I am not sure what order some of these happened in, just that they did happen. These are the events that happened in my bedroom and the guest bedroom, which is now transformed into the nursery. What I think is the first time this happened, it was an average night in the fall. I remember getting spooked thinking I might have seen a shadow person, then dismissed it thinking it might have just been something the fan was blowing and the effects of the kerosene heater.

I fell fast asleep no problem. At the crack of dawn I woke up for no reason. I stretched and sat up to see the clock around my sweetie. It was 5:16. I snuggled back into my pillow, and suddenly I can't move or breathe! I felt that if I could just get Jeff awake it would all stop. Slowly, and I mean very slowly, I crept my hand up the bed towards Jeff's face. I started feeling like I would pass out any second seeing stars. The only thing I could think to do was pinch Jeff's face. I hadn't the strength for anything else. The only sound I could make was a faint croaking, as it felt there was no air in my lungs and they were sucking in on themselves as I tried to breathe.

Finally I get to Jeff's face and I started pinching. He woke up saying ""What the f@#$?!"" As soon as he awoke, I gasped in a deep breath and lay my head sown. Jeff asked if I was okay and I said, ""I am now! Love you!"" and I said a little prayer to God to protect me from evil and fell fast asleep.

The next one was stranger than that one. It was a cold night in winter. I was snuggled under my favorite comforter in bed dozing looking at the pattern the kerosene heater makes on the ceiling. Out of the corner of my eye I catch shadows moving. I get a creepy feeling. I roll to my side and face the shadows, they continue to move. Pooh kitty comes in and parks himself at my feet and stares where I am staring and the movement seems to cease. I fall asleep forgetting to pray.

I wake up a few hours later and notice Jeff has finally come to bed. I roll to my back to space of at the pattern on the ceiling again. I notice something strange. There is a fiery eye in the pattern. I was fairly sure there wasn't an eye there before. I stared at it, and started to feel really weird. Like I was being watched, pardon the pun! Suddenly there was another eye! I got this feeling of dread as it seemed to wink at me. I covered my head and prayed for God to protect me and Jeff from all evil, and I eventually fell asleep. I woke once more needing to use the little girls room and saw the eyes were now longer in the pattern on the ceiling. The heater was still burning along, and it hadn't been moved.

There was another time I saw the shadows darting about my room. It was winter and the heater was burning as usual in the hall in front of one of the doors to our room. I was having a really weird dream about being at an entrance to a cave that was supposed to be like the gates of Hell or something, there was drums, and people I knew from High school that were real partiers were going into it.

I talked to someone/thing there but don't recall what about. Suddenly something had my leg, I woke up and something really did have my leg. I saw a robed figure at my side of the bed, and one at the foot of the bed and both had a grip on me as if they were fighting over me. I scream ""What is it! What is it! Get it off of me!"" and the figure at the side backs away and disappears. The one is still at the foot of the bed and I am sliding. I continue to scream ""What is it? What is it? Get it off of me!"" And Jeff wakes up yelling ""I don't know I don't know! What is it? Get off of her!"" He didn't see it but thought it was pretty funny thinking it was a sleep walking thing or something. I didn't.

The next day I noticed I had scratch marks on my left ankle. The one the robed figure had a hold of. Jeff did think that was strange. We looked all around and in the bed and found nothing that could have done that to me. After that I prayed many nights that God would send these beings back to were they should be. I no longer see shadows like those anymore. Now when I see a shadow it has a human form, and disappears when I look straight at it, unlike these that still would flit in front of my eyes.

The last thing that happened involving disturbing my sleep happened in the spare bedroom when I was eight months pregnant. I was sleeping in the spare room because I would snore and Jeff would wake me up to stop. Plus I enjoyed sprawling out and getting really comfy in my own bed. Well it seems I would always have really weird dreams in this room. A lot of times they would be strange bad dreams, as I used to have in my bedroom before I got a dream catcher. But one night I had a weird dream, and it did involve an old hag, though I can't remember the rest of the dream. She was in the room with me in my dream. And I stopped breathing. When I continued not breathing, I woke up and could breath fine. But I was well aware that I was not breathing as I slept. My heart was racing and I fought to catch my breath.

Now that room is a nursery, I am putting a dream catcher next to my son's crib and am going to bless it, and block it off spiritually as I have my bedroom.

Oh! An update on my parents house from one of my previous stories.

The shadow man I spoke of that wanders from the back room to the hall where the bathroom is encountered my mother. My mom was coming out of the bathroom and it was dark in the house, but there was suddenly an extra dark spot where she could see absolutely nothing what so ever. As she walked through it, she said she felt like she was walking through cobwebs, and she was kind of spitting and flailing her hand in front of her like some would do when they walk through a big spider web. She said the funny thing was she had the distinct feeling that the being was doing the same exact thing. She felt she had caught it off guard and that it did not expect her to be there.

Well that is all for tonight kiddies! Happy hauntings to you all!

Haunted School,Canada,Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: Haunted School

H ere's a story that isn't so terrifying. Compared to my other experiences that is. This story comes from back before I was born, when my dad was 17. My dad grew up in a very, very small town called Alma, located in the province of New Brunswick in Canada's east coast. I'm not exact on when the town was first founded but it has been around for well over 120 years.

My dad was in high school. The school he went to was kindergarten to grade 12, mainly because there weren't a lot of kids in the town, so they only needed one school. His school was still rather big though. It had 3 floors and kind of a look-out type thing on the roof. Coming out of the side of the building were large black slides, which were used as fire escapes.

When I went back last summer (I was 21 at the time) to go visit my grandmother and my dads old hometown, we went to see his old school. As we were driving to it he was telling me that a long time ago before he started school there, there was a fire. One of the slides managed to disconnect itself from the side of the building, and when the teacher made the first student go, he fell three stories and hit the ground. He died instantly... obviously. He said there were many different accidents at the school, which made me a little more excited to visit the school.

I knew I would experience something at this school, If I was lucky, maybe I would even see a ghost. We got to the school and went to the front office and told the principal who we were. My dad knew the principal because they went to that school together when they were kids. I told the principal why I was so interested in visiting the school and he smiled at me and said he would take us for a tour after hours when the students all went home for the night. But before we left we walked around and saw all of the pictures and artwork, and anything else that is hung on the walls of a school. We saw my dads grad picture... wow, I've never seen him without hair before.

After dinner we got a call from Richard (the principal) and he said to come by and he'll take us on the tour of the school. When we first arrived we waited a few minutes before Rich got there. I was looking over to one of the windows on the ground floor and I thought I saw somebody standing in the window. I looked back and it was gone. Which is how it usually goes I guess.

Rich came and we went inside. I asked if we could go into the room where I thought I saw a person in the window. It was the library. He told us that this is where a lot of the daytime activity takes place. He said that librarians would do their rounds, putting books back on their shelves, and when they leave the isle, they would hear a noise. When they go back to the isle they were just in, there would be the books, laying all over the floor.

This made me smile... It was nice to hear that they come out during the day, this way I knew they weren't shy. Our next stop was the second floor. On the way up the stairs I began to feel very lightheaded and nauseous. My dad said he felt a slight headache but nothing serious. We stopped a few minutes so I could catch my breath and we continued on. We walked down a long dark hallway where the classrooms were all located. There were about 8 rooms on this floor. As we walked down the hallway I took a peek into each classroom. It was the second last door on the right that made me feel very uncomfortable. I went inside, Richard and my dad followed. I stood in the middle of the room.

""I'm feeling a very strange vibe in here,"" I told Rich. ""Almost... Almost an angry sort of vibe...""

Richard told me that about 5 years ago a student broke into the school, and hung himself in the classroom, as a surprise for everyone who came to school that day. I didn't ask anything else about it. I'm not really interested in why kids commit suicide. In my spare time I volunteer to make sure kids make the right choices. So this kind of made me sad.

We continued on up to the third floor. I was first up the stairs and when I got to the top of the stairs I stopped. I looked down the hallway to the opposite end of the building, and I saw a little boy, just standing there, arms at his side. I wasn't close enough to see what he was wearing or what his face looked like, nor was there enough light. I slowly stepped a little closer towards him. My dad and Rich stayed back at the door... They knew what was going on, and they didn't want to startle the spirit.

I managed to past the first two rooms. Then the third... I got about 10, maybe 15 yards away from the spirit, and he turned around and walked right through the wall.

I noticed that there was a little door, one that you would have to duck down and pretty much crawl through. I knew this was the door to the fire exit. I looked at it, and that is when I realized that little boy was the one that fell during that fire in the early 1940's.

My dad and Richard came up behind me and asked what happened, and I told them.

Richard explained that the night cleaners would often see him standing there. He said that he was harmless and that he hasn't done anything to harm anybody, nor has he wandered to any other part of the school.

After a little while we finished our tour and went back outside to the truck. We said our goodbyes to Richard and headed back to my grandmothers house. I couldn't get the thought out of my head. Those poor kids. Like I said I do a lot of volunteer work with kids, so hearing about this story made me sad. And little did I know that very soon I would be moving into a house with a ghost of a little girl.

Thanks for taking the time to read my story and I hope you liked it. Please feel free to read my other stories and email me if you have any questions. Also check out my You Tube channel! All of the information is on my profile, so check it out and I hope to hear from you soon!

"My Old Motherly Friend, a Guardian Angel","California, United States",Misc,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Misc :: My Old Motherly Friend, a Guardian Angel

T his story is something that I have not personally experienced, but my mother has told me the story so many times that it feels as though I have. When my mother and father had my older sister, ""Kaity"", they were thrilled. This was their first child and she was healthy and beautiful. The first few months with Kaity was like with every other baby: she would cry in the middle of the night and my father or mother would go to the baby room and try to comfort and quiet her.

When Kaity was about six months old, my mother was woken up, (my father was on a business trip) yet again, by her screaming and crying. As usual, my mother climbed out of bed and pulled on her robe. All of a sudden, the crying stopped. Puzzled and a bit alarmed, she ran down the hall to see if anything was wrong. When she got to the doorway, she saw the most amazing sight: an old woman was sitting in a rocking chair and humming softly to the baby, my sister, in her arms. The moonlight from the window shone right through her and my mother could see the dresser behind her head.

Instead of feeling alarmed, my mother felt warm and happy. She watched the old woman until the woman finally noticed that eyes were on her. She looked up and smiled at my mother, then put a finger to her lips. My mother returned the smile, nodded, and walked quietly back to her room.

The next night, my mother was woken again by Kaity, but instead of crawling slowly out of bed, she jumped up, grabbed her robe and almost ran to the baby room. There, the same old woman was standing next to the cradle and was rocking it gently back and forth, soothing my crying sister. She again smiled at my mother and turned back to Kaity.

This odd phenomenon occurred a few more times before my mother said anything to the old woman. She had been standing in the doorway looking at the woman calm my sister for a few minutes and she finally asked, ""Who are you?"" The old woman did not even turn toward my mother, it was as though she could not hear. My mother asked the same thing, but again, the woman did not reply or show any sign that she had heard my mother at all.

My mother only saw the old woman a few times after that. She guesses that once my sister started to walk and talk, the old woman felt she was not needed anymore. Although she did not actually see the old woman when my older brother or myself was crying as babies, she says she always felt a motherly presence in the room. No matter where we live (my family has moved several times since my sister was a baby) she says she always feels that the woman is always there watching over us.

Sometimes, when I am sad and crying over a death of a friend or family member, I feel as though someone is standing over me, trying to comfort me. This always leaves me with a warm feeling inside and it helps me overcome my grief. My brother says this has happened to him too.

My family has never been able to find out exactly who the old woman is. Maybe she is a relation, or someone like a guardian angel. All we know is that we always have a friend with us; and no matter what happens in our lives, she will never leave us.

High School Haunting,Canada,Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: High School Haunting

I grew up in Calgary Alberta, Canada. I'm sure you all know that by now. When I was in high school, I went to one of the older ones in the downtown area of the city. I didn't really notice anything until my senior year, in my first semester. Yes I did, on occasion experience things in past years going to that school, but nothing like this particular incident.

Let's start from the beginning, my first year in high school. I often heard stories from the older kids about how the school was haunted. Every time I heard a story it would give me a jolt, and I would be scared to venture into the hallways alone.

Tenth grade, I was asked to go down to the janitor's office, which was located in the basement, to get paper towel for our lab we were doing. So I took the long walk to the basement. When I reached the stairs I heard a metallic sound from below, like a large wrench or pipe hitting the floor. I figured it was one of the janitors so I continued down the steps. I got to the bottom and looked down the hall. There was no one to be seen. I walked to the end where the office was located and peeked inside, no one there. I went back down the hall to the big room where the cleaning supplies were kept. No one there. Then I went to the last room in the basement which lead to the boiler room. No one there...

Of course at this point I began to feel uncomfortable, so I ran as fast as I could up the stairs, and out the big metal doors, into the main hallway of the school. I figured I would check the main office and see if the secretary could page them for me. I got to the office and noticed that the janitors were both in the staff room.

The staff room was through the office and to the right, so it was clearly visible to anyone who visited the office.

My second experience happened in my second year, in the eleventh grade. I was on the football team, and we had just returned from a game at another school. It was me and 2 other guys (Team captains) that stayed behind to clean up the mess on the locker room floor and showers. Well this particular night, it was just me. The other two were off to see the Stamps game. So as I was cleaning up the floor I heard what sounded like shoes scuffling on the floor, about two rows behind me. I looked around the corner and noticed nobody was there so I continued on with my cleaning. The scuffling sound continued on the entire time I was cleaning. I didn't feel threatened so I didn't make a big deal about it.

My third experience was in my senior year, and this one is the most memorable one of them all. It was February, and we had just gotten a huge dumping of snow that day. It was unusual, because Calgary isn't the type of place to get that much snow. Luckily our school was the one that decided not to close that day. Which was awesome because there was about 6 feet of snow and it was -35 C (-31 F). Plus I drove an '86 Mustang, and last I checked those don't go so good in that kind of weather. I decided to take city transit and I was still over an hour late.

I got into the school and went to my class. Everyone looked pissed off. Which was understandable.

Before I get to the ghost part of this, let me mention that every single class that day... We watched a movie. Seriously, if it was that important that we go to school on a snow day, let's learn something. We were the only high school that had to go that day.

Okay I'm done ranting. I decided to leave midway through class to go to the vending machines and chill out in the cafeteria. After sitting for a while, I thought back to a few years ago when I was in the basement. I figured this was a good time to go see what was going on down there since no one was out and about.

I got up and went through the big doors and down the stairs. I crept down the hall and peered into the office to make sure the janitor wasn't there. When I turned around to head to the boiler room, the lights went out, and the emergency lights came on. An emergency message came on over the PA that said, ""Attention staff, students, and visitors. Please remain calm. There has been a problem with the power in the building. Please stay where you are until the power is turned back on...""

I stood still, almost too scared to move, because I knew there was a ghost down there, and It didn't help that the power went out. I finally decided to move. I took a few steps forward and I heard the office door behind me creak, and slowly latch closed. I stopped again, terrified. In this hallway there were lockers along both walls. Since there were more students in the school, we had to resort to ""overflow lockers..."" A lot of these vacant lockers were left open.

One by one the locker doors started slamming shut. It wasn't in order, there would be a door slamming shut right beside me, the next at the completely opposite end of the hall, and so on and so forth. I booked it straight for the stairs, and as I was running up the stairs I heard the same metallic sound I heard a few years back, followed by a large bang. I don't know what the bang came from, all I know is that it made me run twice as fast.

When I got to the top of the stairs and out into the main hallway, I sat at a table to catch my breath. I looked down and realized that I had pissed myself. This was great! It was senior year, I was captain of the football team, and I pissed my pants. I ran to the locker room before anyone saw me and changed into my sweat pants, then went to the bus stop to go home.

I don't know what it was, and I hated how it decided to mess with me while the power was out.

Sleep Walking Gone Bad,Australia,Demons / Possessions / Exorcisms,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Demons / Possessions / Exorcisms :: Sleep Walking Gone Bad

T his story happened when I was around 6-7 Years old. I was born in Portugal, but my nationality is Timorese/Chinese. We moved to Australia when I was 4.

Obviously nothing has been going on since, but one night, I was sleep walking; when you sleep walk you don't know you're doing it right? WELL I DID! I was actually trying to control my own body to go back to bed, but it wouldn't. I was scared but then I wasn't. I dunno, I was 6 so I guess I didn't really care.

I ended up going to the bathroom and since I was small, I couldn't see the mirror, or my own reflection for that matter, I could only see the tip of my head, and the only way to see my whole face was if I stood on the stool provided.

I looked up at the mirror, I walked back out and around the house, and that's all I remembered, I ended up going to the bathroom again and looked up at the mirror and THERE! There was this most hideous thing I have EVER SEEN white pale, freaky - I don't know... But it reached its hand out, I remembered I screamed and passed out.

Here is the freaky part. My mum didn't tell me this, but when we were at my Grandma's house I overheard my mum talking about the incident to my Aunties (4 of them - I have 6 Aunties and 7 uncles, all from the same grandma, I know big!) What I heard freaked me out, which at that time caused me to not be able to sleep by myself for 4 years and not be able to look at mirrors during the night (even until now - I cannot look at a mirror at night).

When my mum came in to get me, she saw a shadow figure over my body, she apparently yelled for my dad and grabbed me, what made her freak out even more was that, my eyes were opened and my face was white as snow.

If I ask her about the incident, she'll just ignore me or tell me to shut up.

Don't Taunt Satan,"New Jersey, United States",Old Hags / Night Attacks / Sleep Paralysis,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Old Hags / Night Attacks / Sleep Paralysis :: Don't Taunt Satan

W hen I was in my 20's I was getting a divorce from my husband, so my kids and I moved back home with my mom. Since she only had a 2 bedroom house, I moved into the basement which was semi finished, and the kids took her other bedroom.

A short time later, she had a little bedroom made down in the basement for me.

I have always been interested in ghost and stuff but the occult and demons scared me. I didn't even like to watch movies or shows about them. I also noticed that most horror movies had something bad happen in the basement so I avoided those too. One night I was reading one of the books in the Omen series and threw it across the room because it creeped me out. And vowed never to read a book like that again, especially in my basement!

I don't remember how soon after that occasion this happened but I am sure it was a few weeks or more.

I woke up with a start and felt like the devil himself had entered my room. The pure evil I felt was hard to explain. I couldn't see him but in my mind I could visualize him.

Once I felt him leave, I ran up stairs woke my mother up and told her I had a bad dream because I didn't think she would believe me that I saw the devil, I was shaking so hard it was impossible to calm me down. I would not go back down stairs so I decided to sleep on the couch in the living room. I found my old bible, opened it up to the 23rd psalm and read it out loud and then placed it over my heart and eventually fell asleep.

After reading some of the stories on this site, I wondered if I had the sleep paralysis you talk about but I could move ok and I know I was awake because I did not feel any time missing from the bad feeling to the time I could run out of the room. But who knows.

Years later: Now being a born again Christian, I know that there is good and evil in the world as I have had experiences with both. I remember one time talking to my pastor about my fear of Satan and he told me that he is not like the way he is shown on tv and in the movies. All scary and bigger than life and that he was the great deceiver and to be more careful of his trickery.

Well on my way home that night, I taunted the devil basically saying that I knew his tricks and I was wise to him. (not a good idea)

That night an old boyfriend called me up begging to talk to me because his wife left him and he needed a friend to talk to, so like a fool I met him to talk. By the end of the night, I was raped and then told that the wife hadn't left him, she was away and would be back in a week.

The jokes on me! The great deceiver struck again! I was crushed and then I realized that my taunting satan brought this on me and what a fool I was thinking I could outsmart him. My warning to you is to watch what you say and NEVER taunt satan.

We Don't Think She Really Left,"California, United States",Poltergeists / Physical Manifestations,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Poltergeists / Physical Manifestations :: We Don't Think She Really Left

W e Don't Think She Really Left', 'Recently I had submitted a story about a ghost of a little girl that haunted my current home. After some time and praying for her, I think we managed to help her cross over. It's been good for about a week since that incident with the daisies on my basement floor.

However yesterday we just found out that my fiancé is pregnant. We were so excited! We were sitting on the couch watching TV and writing a list of stuff we would need to start picking up before the baby comes, when Chris got home from school. Geri jumped off the couch and just smiled at him. Which was probably really weird for Chris. I would feel weird too if some woman just jumped in front of me and had a big grin on her face.

Chris looked at me, I was smiling too obviously, and he chuckled. ""What the hell is wrong with you guys?""

Chris was so excited, he gave Geri a big hug, and for the rest of the night all he could say was ""I'm going to be an uncle. How cool is that?""

That night Geri and I sat up in bed and talked for a little while... About money and if we could afford the baby, so on and so forth. Even if we couldn't we would obviously keep it, I don't know of many Christians that would approve of abortions. Suddenly we began to feel very uncomfortable.

The signal on the TV kept cutting in and out, and the temperature dropped quite a bit. We were both confused. We thought that we were able to get through to the little girl and got her to cross over. Unless there is something else in the house that we were not aware of.

Just then, we heard a noise from down the hall from Chris's bedroom. We both ran in to see what was going on. Chris was on his hands and knees picking up a bunch of books that he said just flew off his shelf. He had nothing nice to say about what was going on.

We helped clean up the mess and went back to our room. When we left our room, we had both of our bedside lamps on, as well as the TV. When we got back, they were all shut off and our window was wide open. Geri and I got out our bible and started praying in tongues to get whatever it was to stop, because we weren't going to take it.

Nothing happened for the rest of the night. I just got home from work today, and had to submit this story! Nothing has happened while we were gone, and I am home alone right now so I hope nothing happens...

If this continues I will keep everyone updated. I personally think that the little girl didn't leave. She might have just been hiding or just keeping to herself this past week. I don't know. But I think that she isn't very happy with the fact that my fiancé is pregnant.

It's just a thought... If that is the case, that's a little too creepy for me.

Sweet Ghost Dog,"Alaska, United States",Pets / Animals,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Pets / Animals :: Sweet Ghost Dog

I 'm not quite sure if this took place in Alaska or not, actually, but this is a story that my Grampa told me. (And no, it's not fake. He said it actually happened to him.) One day, quite early in the morning, my Grampa woke to the sound of a dog barking. When he opened his eyes, and looked around, he saw a ghostly looking lab (I believe he said it was) sitting by his bed, still barking at him.

He told the dog to go home, and he went to bed, the dog disappearing. He obviously wasn't affected with the fact it was a ghost but... Eh.

A week went by, and the dog kept appearing, barking at him. Every now and then, Grampa would wake up to the dog gone, but it was still barking.

After a while, he decided to go to my Grammy, and asked her what he should do. I guess my Grammy is (or was) someone who could see, and talk to ghosts and such on a regular basis. Well, after he asked her, she told him next time he saw the doggy, to ask it what was the matter.

And so, the next morning, my Grampa woke to the dog barking again. He followed my Grammy's advice, sitting up and looking at the dog. He then asked it ""What's the matter little fella?"" The dog then responded - like, actually talked - telling his story of why he was there.

The little guy was looking for help. When he was alive he had a master and best friend who was a young girl. He loved to play with her, and one of the games he played was to hide her toys. He had recently hidden one of her favorite toy dolls in some woods near by, and saw that the little girl was upset because she couldn't find it anywhere.

He was going to go back and get it, when he was run over by a truck, and killed. So, he asked if my Grampa could go and get the doll, and return it for him. My Grampa accepted, and the dog said that he had hid it under a maple tree.

That day, my Grampa went into those woods, and just as the ghost hound said, right under a maple tree - the only one in miles in those woods - was a little toy doll. Grampa picked it up, and went back to return it to the girl.

After he had done so, the next day, Grampa woke up to the ghost dog again, only he wasn't barking this time. Grampa told the dog that he had done what was asked, and returned the doll to the little girl.

The dog thanked him, and disappeared, and was never seen again after that day.

I think the story is very sweet, and so is that nice dog. I've told many of my friends it, and seeing as my Grampa is disabled and can't tell it himself, I'd share it all with you on here.

It just goes to show that not all ghosts are bad. Sometimes you just need to ask them what's up, so you can help them move on.

Attacked by a Dark Entity at Night,"California, United States",Old Hags / Night Attacks / Sleep Paralysis,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Old Hags / Night Attacks / Sleep Paralysis :: Attacked by a Dark Entity at Night

I am new to this site, as I found it after the incident that literally just happened to me. I'll give some background info; I'm 19 years old, I am a strong believer in Christ, yet I have some personal demons that I have been struggling with for some time. I have not always been a believer, I have my reasons for becoming religious.

I've been really skeptical about ghost stories and the like, since this stuff never really happened to me. Lately I have been feeling a little dark. I feel like something is going to happen, something bad. I have a strange gift for being empathetic, and can usually tell exactly what is going to happen in the near future.

The other night I was laying in my room about to go to sleep, when the first incident happened. It was probably after 3am and I begun to hear something moving in my room. It was a scraping or dragging noise, and it sounded like it was getting closer in intervals of about 10 seconds. Of course I got really freaked out, but I did not want to move. I knew in my mind that this was not a physical threat, and it was something I still cannot explain. It got closer to my bed until it sounded like it was almost underneath me. I finally jumped up when the poster right next to my head basically blew off the wall. I prayed a little bit and went back to sleep.

For a few days nothing happened, but I was having a really bad feeling still. I got home late again last night, and I was having a little trouble sleeping. I finally started to drift off to sleep around 4am. I began having a vivid dream about my job. Everything was fine until...

BAM - something hit me in the face. I'm not talking about a gentile poke, something forcefully hit me in the face and woke me up. I cannot explain the feeling exactly. It was not really painful, but it felt like it had some strength behind it. It also felt like it hit my entire face/front of my head with equal power. It also took me a few minutes to really think about what happened since I was deep in a dream. I laid in bed scared for about 20 more minutes. I did not want to move or do anything, as I really had no idea what the hell happened. I prayed some more and tried to go back to sleep. It's a little hard when something just hit you in the face and you have no idea what it was!

It wasn't over... I began drifting off to sleep again. By this time (after laying in bed for about an hour) it was starting to becoming light out. I felt safer and fell asleep again. I began having another dream that I was in a restaurant. In the dream I started coughing and choking, and I instantly snapped out of it again. This is when things got crazy.

First of all, I was paralyzed. I could not move and my heart rate shot up noticeably. I cannot describe the feeling of what was happening perfectly. Something was trying to control me, and was succeeding. My ears were ringing and I began hallucinating. I was not dreaming or anything at this point, I was completely awake and alert of what was happening. Whatever it was forcefully moved my head towards the right. I have a poster on my wall of a few girls, and it had turned into a picture of a hand, like a controlling, sinister hand. I begun freaking out as I fought to breath and move and break free of whatever had control of me.

I almost begun to panic, since I was being full-on attacked. I remembered to try and stay calm but it was becoming hard as whatever this was fought for control of me. I prayed some more and it seemed to give up. I was wrong. It attacked again after about a minute. Stronger and harder than before. This time my blankets even fell off my bed. I kicked my feet a little bit and prayed more. I could barely speak, and when I did I could only mumble ""God help me"".

This occurred not one or two times, but FIVE OR SIX. Each time there was about a minute break between. Between each attack I felt exhausted and could not get up right away. I was trying to catch my breath and it would happen again. Each time shadows would move all around my walls. On what I believe was the sixth try my door opened up. At this point I thought it was my mom and I tried to mumble something out. I managed to say ""Mom help I can't move"". There was no answer. My door shut and than I felt something grab my leg. I begun freaking out more than ever. My door opened again and I heard something come towards my bed, and than something under my bed. I tried to shout for my mom but no words could escape my mouth. I believe it attacked one more time before it finally left. I than realized that my mother never checked in on me this morning.

It is now 7:30am and I have yet to sleep. I am no longer scared, I actually feel a little calm. I know it is gone for a little, but am very clueless at this point. What the hell is happening to me? I've never had an experience like this before, and after reading some stories on this site I gather this is a pretty significant one. Somebody please help!

My Grandpa,Canada,Family / Friends Visits,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Family / Friends Visits :: My Grandpa

M y Grandpa was an amazing man and we were always very close. He always did everything humanly possible to make life good, first for my mother and uncles, than for me and my brother. When I was little he would always take me on long walks that would always seem to end with a trip to a park or ice cream store.

We even had our own ""secret park"". We called it that because it was at the end of a dead-end street, was surrounded by trees and bushes and no one ever seemed to go there but us.

In the last few years Grandpa was unable to go on long walks because of sore knees and back, so we would hang out in his garage or basement and spend hours talking. As I'm sure you can tell I love him very much, so it was a horrible shock last December when my Mom called to say Grandpa had a stroke and was in the hospital. At the time I was in school, 800 kilometers from home and 1000 from my Grandpa. I had a plane ticket home for when I finished my exams so I kept myself going thinking I would see him soon.

It was my exam week, 3 weeks after Grandpa's stroke. My Grandpa had already lived longer than anyone had expected although he has half paralyzed, and in a deep coma. It was Tuesday night; I had one exam on Wednesday and was flying home on Thursday. I had gone to early that night but was unable to sleep and was thinking about Grandpa. I began to feel like we were together, so I began to talk to him, telling him I loved him and missed him. I was telling him goodbye.

The next day I did my exam, finished packing, and went out with friends. When I got home my parents called me. Grandpa had died. The night before my entire family had gathered in his room with his priest. At one point the priest and my Mom were talking and Rev. Paula said she couldn't understand what he was holding on for. ""It's like he's waiting for something"" she said. When Mom heard that she said, ""Oh Paula I told him Kate would be home on Thursday, maybe he's waiting for her..."" After that they went to him and said that I was with him in spirit. It was at that same moment that I felt he was there in my room with me and I said goodbye.

In January, after the funeral, Christmas, and my return to school, I had a strange dream. It was the most realistic dream I've ever had. I was at my Grandparents house and it was summer and I could even smell the flowers and feel the heat of the sun and the ground under my bare feet. I was cleaning out my Grandpa's truck, and there were other people around me, working in the yard. I looked up and saw my Grandpa walking down the street, away from me.

I first thought ""But he's dead"" then decided I didn't care and tried to follow him but the other people in the yard came up around me. One put his hand on my shoulder and said ""It's not time, you can't follow him yet..."" I cried but stayed where I was and watched walk down the street towards our secret park and disappear behind the trees. When I woke the next morning that was the first day I truly accepted he was gone.

In March I was really struggling. I was still trying to accept Grandpa's death, then my Aunt died and another Aunt became very ill. Then a boy who lived down the hall from me killed himself. Going back to my place after school after all these things happened I was climbing the stairs when I could smell something that was just like my Grandpa's garage. Strange as it may sound, it made me feel a lot better, but I didn't think much of it.

Later in my room I was sitting at my desk when suddenly I could smell my Grandpa. It was a mix of his aftershave, soap, and just his personal smell. It was sudden and strange enough that I began to sniff around trying to find where it was coming from (and probably looking completely nuts in the process). The smell came from behind and slightly to the right of my chair. It didn't scare me, it was comforting.

Several times over the next few days I would smell him and sometimes it would feel like a hand was on my shoulder. At night I would hear slow deep breathing on the other side of my room, sounding like someone was asleep over there. Along with the smells, sounds and touches, was the strong feeling of love and protection. I know my grandpa had come to help me through this horrible time when I was so far away from my family.

After about a week of this I began to feel stronger and think that Grandpa shouldn't feel he should stay on earth with me but should be in heaven. So I said ""Grandpa I love you and miss you, but I'll be alright. You don't have to stay anymore and I'll see you again one day..."" After saying that I felt like I was surrounded with love, it felt like a hug. Then he was gone.

I haven't felt Grandpa physically close to me. I miss him but I know I'll see him again one day.

The Missing Doll,"New Jersey, United States",Misc,"I was living in New Jersey, admittedly quite young, when I dreamt about the doll. It was one of those soft bodied dolls that was common for children in the early 60's, with a smiling ceramic face and a soft plush body. It was also one of my very favorites, and I carried it everywhere like Linus carries his blanket.

In my dream, I was standing on a cement bridge, watching the current of a swift-moving river zipping quickly under my feet. Suddenly I saw my favorite doll, face up in the water, being dragged through the water far below my feet! I looked around quickly to see if there was anyone I recognized but the streets were full of indifferent strangers!

So I raced across the road to peer off the other side of the bridge and here came my dolly, still face-up, practically imploring me to save it from the waterfall looming ahead! When it crashed over the side, tumbling in a volley of other dolls, and styrofoam cups and detritus from other observers, I woke with a start.

Sitting up in bed, I wondered if my doll were really missing. Had it really gone over the edge of a big waterfall? I looked for it in vain. Under the bed, in the closet, smashed in the blankets or under some toys.

A Husbands Last Promise,"Virginia, United States",Family / Friends Visits,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Family / Friends Visits :: A Husbands Last Promise

J ust a little background before I get to the story at hand. My grandfather (Papa) died on August 19, 1999. He had been on dialysis for 4 years and died in the hospital of heart failure. On Tuesday, August 17th, he told the doctor that he didn't have but about 2 more days to live and he was right.

We thought that we would lose my grandmother (Granny) not long after my Papa died, but she proved all of us wrong. She had taken care of him since the day he got sick and that was all she had known for 4 years. They had been married for over 56 years.

Fast forward to 2006. Granny was diagnosed with lung, bone, and stomach cancer on August 15, 2006. The following Wednesday she had a porta cath (sp) put in to start chemo and on that Friday, found out she had 4th stage brain cancer. After finding out that she had the brain cancer she opted not to do chemo or radiation and just live out the rest of her days however God chose fit.

My parents lived with my grandparents since my Papa had gotten sick and my kids and I only lived about 8 miles from them. We were down there a lot, but after she was diagnosed with cancer, we were down there every day.

Two weeks before my Granny died we were down visiting and her and I were sitting on the front porch. She looked at me and said, ""Guess who came to visit me today?"" My reply was, I don't know and I was trying to guess who had stopped by to see her that maybe hadn't been around for a while. After a few wrong guesses, I finally said I don't know who. Her reply was, Papa. Believing that this was very well possible, I asked her when and what had happened. She began to tell me how she had gotten up out of bed that morning, went into the kitchen to fix her some toast to take with her medicine, and went back to her bedroom to watch TV. She had just sat down on the bed when he appeared at the window and started to walk over to her. Of course this caught her by surprise, and she started to cry. He simply told her that he was coming to get her soon. She asked him when and all he said was soon, then he just disappeared. She told me that she sat there for about an hour crying and asking him to come back just one more time.

On Friday, October 13th, we had gone down there to visit and she was a little slow but was still coherent. As my kids and I were about to leave, she asked me to wait for just 30 minutes. I told her that I couldn't and that we would be back down there first thing on Saturday. By the time we arrived Saturday, she was not coherent and could only keep her eyes open for about 30 seconds at a time the most. She died at 10:24 on Sunday, October 15th.

My mother said that before she took her last breathe that she smiled and waved. One of her sisters that was there said, did you see her wave at us. My mother's reply was, she wasn't waving at us, she was waving at the ones we couldn't see, the ones that came to get her.

I know that Papa was one of the ones who came to meet her, because he told her that he was coming to get her. The one thing that I will regret until the day that I die is that I didn't wait just 30 more minutes. If I had known what was about to happen, I would have stayed. I have learned the hard way not to take the people in your life for granted and cherish every single moment with them.

Footsteps in the Hallway,"California, United States",Apparitions / Voices / Touches,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Apparitions / Voices / Touches :: Footsteps in the Hallway

A lright, this is my first submission here, and I'm mainly posting it because I want to know what it is, and it scares the heck out of me to this day. The time was around ten thirty to midnight, I was laying in bed. I was sleeping normally, I don't have any recollections of weird dreams or anything.

The first out of the ordinary event was that my dog began barking loudly. This wasn't just a ""there's a squirrel in the backyard!"" bark, this was a panicked whining bark. I woke up as he bolted out my bedroom door. I sat up and closed the door which he had opened and lay back down.

Shortly after, I clearly heard footsteps walking down my hall. The layout of my hall is this: On one side is my parent's room, then comes a bathroom, then my room, then on the other end, my little sister's room. These footsteps were coming from my parent's room. Naturally, I thought it was my mom or dad coming to see why the dog was barking. Then, I realized that the footsteps were much too light! They sounded like my little sister who was about seven at the time. However, the person walking down the hall couldn't be her, she was asleep in her room on the other end of the hall. The footsteps slowly got closer, and I lay there, terrified. They reached my door, and stopped. They did not begin again.

Feeling Voices,"Oklahoma, United States",Psychic / Medium,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Psychic / Medium :: Feeling Voices

I 'm fifteen and live in Oklahoma, and have all my life. I recently stumbled upon this site while doing some research on my own. And it seems as though I can ask for advice when it comes to the paranormal, and you guys seem to know what you're talking about. So maybe you can help me.

Sometimes I hear things. Voices, when I'm alone. But they're not normal voices, like someone invisible is talking to me. It's more like I feel them, like they're in my head and they're clearer than anything I can actually physically hear. And they never say much, it's normally just a word or two. They like to say my name, a lot, or gibberish.

I can remember hearing these things from childhood. Once in particular I remembering being in my Grandmother's house. She lives in an old a turn-of-the-century sand-stone house that was very popular amongst the more well-off people that lived in the small Midwestern town I grew up in. It was once converted into a hospital. I don't know if it has anything to do with the general air of creepy-ness that surrounds it, but I think it might.

As a child I would stay long extended periods at that house, roaming the second story, alone. And I can remember walking down the small hallway and hearing something say my name, and not just hearing it, feeling it in my head. Needless to say, it frightened me very badly, and I ran down stairs in terror.

It happens more now, I'd forgotten about it until recently, upon the death of my Grandfather, whom I was very close too.

But now it's come back, it's a little different. Sometimes I feel something touching me. Like, the other night I was laying in bed, and I felt the side of my face start to tingle, from temple to jaw line. It's frightening, but I cannot say for sure that it's paranormal or not.

Is it the result of my over-active imagination? Or is it a Ghost? Or possibly an undiagnosed case of schizophrenia?

My Little Brother Plays with Our Great Grandfather,Canada,Family / Friends Visits,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Family / Friends Visits :: My Little Brother Plays with Our Great Grandfather

M y name is Caitlin, and my Great Grandfather passed away in January and some things have been happening since he passed. My baby brother who is 2, only knows my Grandfather as Momo, that was one of his first words. And since he's only 2, he doesn't understand that ""Momo"" passed away. And so about a month after he passed, my brother would get up early every morning before everyone else, and he would play in his room, but one morning, he was playing and talking so loud he woke me and my step mom up.

And since I was already awake I told her she could go back to bed and I'd stay up with him. So it was me and my little brother awake, and he asked me ""Hey sissy, you want to play with me and Momo!"" I was speechless at this point and since I was still kind of tired I asked him again ""Halen, who are you playing with?"" And he said ""I Play with Momo, he play cars with me..."" I said, ""Halen, is Momo here right now?"" And he said ""Yeap!"" So by this point, I wasn't scared but actually kind of excited and puzzled at the same time.

I grew up in a very religious family, I am Christian, and I've ALWAYS believed in Angels, Spirits and Ghosts. So I wasn't scared. I woke my dad up, because it is my dad's grandfather, but since my dad never knew his father, that's who he considers his dad. And he said that this wasn't the first time Halen's talked to ""Momo"" and that he knew Halen could see him.

The next incident happened a week later and we were all cleaning the house and my brothers and sisters were playing in the play room, and all of a sudden I look over and my brother was standing at the door talking to himself, or someone else. So I said ""Hey Halen, what are you doing?"" And he said ""Shh, wait"" and than he turned back around to the door and says ""Ok Momo, Goodbye I Love You!"" and he ran back to me and says ""I talk to momo Sissy!"" By this point I was almost in tears, because I do miss my Momo so much, and just to have my brother be able to see him, is amazing.

Other little things have happened as well, nothing scary, I've taken them as signs that my Momo is there watching over us. But I am very curious, do you think it could be him? I hope it is, that way I know he's not really gone, he's there watching over us.

FYI: I Changed my brothers name in the story, Halen's not his real name. Thanks!

South Minneapolis Home,"Minnesota, United States",Ghost Hunting,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Ghost Hunting :: South Minneapolis Home

W e did an investigation in a south Minneapolis house that has a lot of history involving the usual electrical anomalies. Stereos ranging in volume, lights flickering only at night? We sent in a team of trained investigators over several investigations to record and research the activity. We witnessed the owner actually attempting to turn down the volume, when it increased with no success.

We have investigated this house continuously for 7 years and the levels of activity have ranged from a stereo turning up and down to a person actually being pushed down (his feet was pulled out and he dropped in the middle of the kitchen). We used EMF detectors, EVP recorders, Thermo Couplers, Infra red digital video recorders and still image photo recorders to evaluate the events.

We have had the stove turned on right after we set an oil lamp on the burner by mistake...

During an all night investigation team members were woken up to a video camera light turning on and facing the area they were sleeping during the investigation.

We have collected 3 shattering pictures of our investigations where a lot of activity has existed in the past. Please view the pictures here or at the following page mnprophet.com :

Baby Sister,Philippines,Apparitions / Voices / Touches,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Apparitions / Voices / Touches :: Baby Sister

M e and my sister have an 11 year age gap. So when she was 2 years old and I was already 13 it was then that she to started to learn how to go up and down the stairs. One night, when I came home from school I was feeling woozy and my head was aching so after we ate dinner I quickly went up to my room to sleep.

I turned all the lights off in the second floor of our house and went to bed. I can still hear my baby sister playing down stairs not too long after that and I remember the TV being off. A few seconds later I saw that the lights in my parents' room had been turned on when I turned it off earlier and the door in my room was opened by a little shadow who I thought was my sister. The light from the other room bothered me so much that I had to get up and turned it off my self.

I was so pissed off by what happened since I specifically said that they shouldn't have let my sister go up the stairs because of my massive head ache and she might fall from it. So I went down stairs to my mom but I didn't see my sister anywhere.

I asked her:  ""Ma, why did you let her go up stairs? She bothered my sleep!"" My mom's answer was something I didn't expect, she said: ""Who? Your sister? Your cousin took your sister to their house 30 minutes ago..."" That's when I realized that light switch was too high for my sister to reach even if she used a chair on which wasn't available that time. And that's when I started to ask myself who was making the ""baby playing"" noises when the TV was off and no other house near  us had a baby?

First True Experience,"Georgia, United States",Old Hags / Night Attacks / Sleep Paralysis,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Old Hags / Night Attacks / Sleep Paralysis :: First True Experience

I guess I'll start this story at the beginning and describe my childhood. When I was 4, my family moved from Florida to a farm in north Georgia. At the time it was four of us, my father, mother, younger brother and me. The house we moved to was a very old farm house built in 1890 and everything in the place was original, with only the electrical wiring and plumbing being ""newer"", though from the 60s themselves.

The house was the epitome of what one would imagine of a ""haunted"" house. Old windows that rattled in the wind, no insulation anywhere, allowing for drafts to come and go as they please, wood floors, walls and ceilings that creaked constantly, and an old tin roof that leaked in the rain and popped in the sun. We also had several very old outbuildings that were quite creepy, though for a little boy, they were fascinating.

We owned a little over 200 acres and growing up, I crawled all over that place. To this day I do not know if the house had any kind of history, but years later while clearing a back piece of our land, we did discover 20+ Cherokee Indian burial mounds. This was yet another fascinating find as I myself am part Cherokee (though barely - 1/16). That said I doubt they had any influence on the house, being more then half a mile away, but I will say that I saw a lot of interesting stuff in the woods surrounding them. Honestly, I can say that I truly loved growing up on that farm, but it did not go without its dark history as well.

My first accounts started when I was 6, and really, based on my memory, went throughout my childhood in random succession. Growing up, I had little fear of anything, being taught that everything in the woods are more afraid of you then you are of it, I would walk the woods at night without a light, I could hear strange sounds in the house and find them ""cool"", watch spooky movies and laugh, etc.

No, what I feared most as a child was going to sleep. And it wasn't just the nightmares, which were very frequent, but also the after affects of the night as well. Most of the times the nightmares would wake me up in a cold sweat or shaking or in physical pain, but sometimes I would wake with a black eye or bloodied lip. At first my parents would say that I probably rolled out of bed and hit the floor or maybe tripped on something while going to the bathroom and not remember it. It wasn't until I was 8 that things got a little more... Serious.

My parents had different sleep schedules, my father being in bed by 10pm whereas my mother would stay up until around midnight or so. On one of these nights she had stayed up later then normal, watching something on TV until well after 1am. She had gotten up during a commercial to go to the kitchen when she had heard something coming from our bedroom (me and my brother shared a room). She stepped into the doorway and I guess she heard me groaning and crying, so she flicked on the light, which for some reason immediately blew out. I don't remember much up until the light flashing, which at that point I remember feeling as if my nightmare was real and I was fighting it off of me. I recall my mother screaming for my father who came down the hall, flashlight in hand and remember the beam of light hitting my face and him picking me up off the bed. They took me into the bathroom and washed my face but I guess exhaustion took over because I don't recall anything after that. What my mother told me the next morning sent chills down my spine and gave me my first taste of real fear.

She said that when she had flicked on the light, it looked like a dark shape had been on top of me and was swinging violently in my direction. She had thought that it might have been my brother (we fought a lot as brothers do) but she said that she could see him asleep in his bed. Since the light flashed off so fast she said that she couldn't see anything after that except spots but that when she saw my face she had been terrorized by what she saw.

Looking in the mirror that next morning I got to see the truth, black eye forming, dried blood in my nose, a busted lip, and strange scratches along the left side of my face. Obviously I did not go to school that next day, but I don't think staying at home helped much either. It was fairly quiet around the house, nobody really speaking about what happened, dad out working the cattle, mom doing chores around the house and me watching TV.

Really, in time, what happened that night faded from everyone's minds, and only on certain occasions do I even think about it. I can say this much though, looking back over the years, I have analyzed what happened and I can be fairly certain of this much, that was no ghost that haunted me. This was but only the beginning of what life had to throw at me. Fun...

I Saw Grandma,Canada,Family / Friends Visits,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Family / Friends Visits :: I Saw Grandma

T his happened two years after my grandma died, I was 17, I'm now 27, for about a week I was dreaming of her every night, I couldn't figure out what she wanted, she kept trying to tell me something. My mother was telling me to go to church and light a candle for her because maybe she's not at peace.

I was sleeping one night, my mom was still awake and she was on the phone talking to family members that live in europe (they are six hours ahead), I was sound asleep when I suddenly woke up. It was pitch dark in my bedroom and I felt like I was woken up by something, I was 100% awake, I know I wasn't dreaming, and I noticed something in the corner of my eye it was a bright light. I looked over and I saw my grandma standing there just looking at me! Mind you I couldn't really see her facial features but I remember that she was wearing a white sweater, I was frozen in shock!

I tried to bang on the wall to call my mom because I couldn't scream, my hand froze mid air, she was standing there for what appeared to be about a minute When she finally disappeared. I ran out of the room and I was trying to tell my mom what I just saw but the words wouldn't come out, I was having a panic attack and had trouble breathing, my mom was going to call the ambulance but I stopped her and was finally able to tell her what I saw. I don't know if she believed me, she said I probably had a nightmare, I got defensive because I know it wasn't a dream, I was wide awake. I looked at the time it was 3:30 in the morning, I never went back to sleep that night.

About 2 months ago, I went to a really well known medium because my dad passed away in jan, 08 and I wanted to hear what she had to say about him and after my reading, she said to me, ""your grandma visits you all the time as well she just doesn't want to make her presence known because she knows that she scared you half to death and she's sorry about that"", the medium also told me that she came and woke me up between 3:30 and 4 in the morning. I couldn't believe that she mentioned that incident because I never even thought of that, I was strictly there to hear about my dad. But I'm happy to know that she's still around.

The Beautiful Women in our Driveway,"California, United States",Apparitions / Voices / Touches,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Apparitions / Voices / Touches :: The Beautiful Women in our Driveway

W hen I was nine years old in the late 1970's, my twin sister and I were playing in our long driveway at the very end near the back side door and garage. Our house was big and old with two stories. My parents only used the front part of the driveway to park their cars and sectioned it off by putting up a fence with a gate a little past the middle of the driveway. The garage was at the end and was used for storage only.

It was a warm sunny Sunday afternoon when we were playing in the driveway, my parents were both in the living room with my father at the dining room table reading through ""his"" important papers, and my mother on the sofa reading one of her woman's magazines.

I forget exactly what we were playing in the driveway, but we were really into it when out of nowhere we hear a soft, very sweet woman's voice calling out ""excuse me, excuse me"". We stopped what we were doing and both look up towards the gate where the voice was coming from. Seeing a very pretty youngish woman, about 30ish, standing there at the fence behind the gate, we both just automatically not thinking anything of it, walked right up to her. We did notice immediately that she did not look like anyone else we had ever seen and that her clothes were of another time like from the 30's or 40's. She had that short waved hair they wore then, a hat with the mesh like veil covering her forehead and a black skirt suit on with a matching jacket that you see in the old movies of that time. She wore black gloves that was also worn by women in that time period.

She rested both of her hands over the gate. She had a very pretty smile with red lipstick on and we both remember her creamy white skin and green eyes. The lipstick is the only makeup we remember her wearing. She smelled nicely also, we both will never forget her perfume smell.

As we were standing there looking up at her in wonderment because she was a young woman, not an old woman, wearing these old style clothes and hair and very pretty, she then asked us both ""where is your father?"", ""can I please see your father?"".

We both thought it was strange but I managed to tell her ""I'll go get him"", we both then go through the back side door, ran in the house and into the living room where my parents were and yelled ""Mom, Dad, there is a really pretty lady in the driveway wearing old style clothes asking to see Dad"", ""Dad come on"", I said, ""she wants to see you and is asking for you..."" My mom always being the skeptic just said ""it's probably someone from church..."" I knew it wasn't and so did my sister. And for some reason when my mother said that I honestly just knew in my heart it was a ghost, strange but true. My sister said she knew upon seeing her that it was a ghost but wasn't scared.

Onto the story, my dad gets up and follows us through the house without saying anything and we all three go out the back side door into the driveway and the young woman was gone. We told our dad it was true she was here, he just said ""alright, alright"", ""I believe you"", but didn't really sound convincing. We looked up and down the street and there was no sight of this strange woman.

To this day we talk about it, my mother says she also remembers this incident. It will always be a mystery to us as to who she was, a long dead relative of my father's coming by to say hello to him? Someone that had to do with the house before my parents bought it? We just will never know for sure. Thanks for reading.

The Friendly and the Angry Ghosts,Netherlands,Photographs / Videos / EVP,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Photographs / Videos / EVP :: The Friendly and the Angry Ghosts

I am Merwin Meibos and I live in Holland (heerenveen). From when I was young (5/6/7 years old), I encountered a variety of ghosts. I could always see them, but I lost this ability when I reached puberty. Because of this, I lost my faith in ghosts until these new ghosts appeared in my room. I say ghosts because there were more then one (one was friendly, one was angry). I can't see either of the ghosts, but they make me really clear that they are there all the time.

The angry one makes a lot of little noises and gives me the feeling like I'm being watched all the time. These noises contain banging sounds from my gas stove, sounds like the curtains are rubbing against the wall and a really creepy scratching sound from my music boxes. These boxes aren't broken, that's for sure. I did picture this evil ghost on my digital camera. In the corner of one picture you can see something really red.

However, a month or 2 ago this angry ghost disappeared all of a sudden, or at least it doesn't make any sounds anymore. Now the friendly ghost is in my room all of the time... It's a really kind spirit and it makes me feel really relaxed. For some kind of reason, I believe it was a women.

She touches me a lot, like for example padding me on the shoulder or going through my hair with her hand. I don't mind this ghost, and I am really happy that the angry one disappeared.

The Light of Our Way Home,Philippines,Apparitions / Voices / Touches,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Apparitions / Voices / Touches :: The Light of Our Way Home

W hen I was a little girl, my cousins and I used to go to a little forest that we go around to and just mess around. We knew every step of our way to that forest. We never really got lost or got hurt there but one really gray day at about 12:00, we decided to just go out and play at the same spot we always play at. It started to rain just as we were about to play hide and seek. We tried to ignore it and just kept playing, but we couldn't and it started to fog and rain harder and harder every time. We tried to head home but it was too foggy to find our way.

Then about 200 yards away from me I saw a light. It looked like a figure of a little girl about 5 years old. I never saw the face but I knew that it was our way out. So I told my cousins to follow me and they did. It turned left and right so we followed every step of the way. As I came closer the light grew lighter. Then it was gone. Just then I noticed that we were finally on a road that lead to our home. I was so glad. But I kept thinking about that little girl. It must have been an angel because it helped us find our way home.

I never saw the little girl ever since the accident. But I knew that she was watching over us.

Haunted Casino in Manistee,"Michigan, United States",Old Hags / Night Attacks / Sleep Paralysis,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Old Hags / Night Attacks / Sleep Paralysis :: Haunted Casino in Manistee

T his past February I had a strange and somewhat terrifying experience in room 202 at the Little River Casino in Manistee, Michigan . In the suite was my brother and his wife, me and my children ages 8 and 9. I awoke around 3:30 in the morning to the sensation of a pressure on my side, kind of pushing me down. I thought it might be one of my daughters pushing me down. I raised my arm out to try to push off whatever was on top of me. I felt something substantial, but definitely not either one of my kids. It was at that time I began to get frightened.

I was laying on my side so I turned my head to my right shoulder to get a glimpse of what was on top of me. I saw a large dark funnel of no substantial shape. I heard a mocking laugh. I struggled, to no avail. I decided to let the entity know that they should get off of me in the name of Jesus Christ. The funnel suddenly hit the ceiling and disappeared.

There I was; very frightened, hoping it was a dream. I decided to switch sides on the bed. I woke nobody up, as I felt like my sister-in-law would think I was nuts and I didn't want to scare my kids. So I tried going back to sleep. This is when I felt hands all over the front of me, pushing and pulling. I knew I was sleeping when the second attack began as the sensations began to wake me up.

I cried out, and this woke my sister-in-law. She said she looked over at me in bed and saw that I had a dark figure over me with its ""arms"" wrapped around me. My brother then heard my cry, turned on the light and asked me if I was okay. I told him that I was definitely not okay. My sister-in-law told my brother what I saw, and I told him what I experienced. Unfortunately, we were looking at another night in the same room already paid for. Thus, I didn't sleep and basically played ""night watchmen"". I was ready with my camera should the entity return. The only thing that happened was my daughter crying in her sleep and I could see nothing bothering her from my viewpoint.

I would like to clarify I was on no medications, had not drunk any alcohol during this trip. This was the scariest thing to ever happen to me, and because of what my sister-in-law witnessed as I cried out leads me to believe it may be paranormal. My concern is, will other people suffer this same malady in that room? I definitely believe it was malevolent. Another question I am left with is, is this the attack from a ""shadow person""? My best friend told me I should have asked for a different room. I was too worried the staff would think I was crazy!

The Little River Casino is a somewhat new casino, and I am not aware of any history with the place.

Ghost Farmer,"Illinois, United States",Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: Ghost Farmer

I grew up in Lisle, IL. It is a smaller suburb compared to Naperville and other surrounding burbs. In the 30s it was a farming community. My grandparents, like most of the growing community members, had a house built during the 50s. My parents and I moved in with them around 1984, when I was an infant. I resided there with my parents and grandparents until I was 18.

Around the age of 12 was my first experience. I had stepped into the shower. Our bathroom window looked out onto the backyard. We had a shed with a small porch light, a swing and some small flowerbeds scattered in the yard. Roughly 5 minutes into the shower, I looked out the window. I saw an older looking man, thin, dressed in overalls and holding some sort of tool. He looked tired and his eyes seemed empty. Almost sad. He looked right at me without flinching. It was not the steam from the shower or any kind of fog/smoke outside. The shed light was off. All of my family were indoors.

I looked at him for what felt like forever, in reality maybe 20 seconds. I remember kind of gasping and taking a step back from the window. Then he was gone. I finished my shower. Explained what happened to my father in the hall. He went outside. Checked everything... garage... shed... behind the shed. Nothing. I was told I probably saw fog or something.

A few nights later, I was getting ready to make a phone call in my parent's room. Their phone was by the window that looked over the side of the house... First floor. My father was putting away something in his dresser behind me. I started to dial, waited for the other end to answer. While waiting I looked out the window, there was the ""farmer"" again. Dressed the same... Sad eyes etc. I gasped; my father turned around and saw him too. He stood there looking at us. I of course had forgotten about my phone call, and turned to my father. Turn back to the window he was gone. The only thing I saw was my father frantically running along the side of the house with the flashlight.

Throughout my life I had a lot of strange feelings in the home. I saw the ""farmer"" a few more times... A lot happened living there. But I guess I can save it for another time. I thank everyone for reading this. Commenting and well wishes to all.

The House On W. Elmwood Avenue,"California, United States",Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: The House On W. Elmwood Avenue

T his is a story about a house. There are many stories about this house I have to tell. This is just a few of the occurrences, incidents, sightings that went on in this house within the time I lived in it with my family. If you have read my previous story it also took place in this house . I have tried to look into the history of it. Only to find that each families hands it has fallen into all have lost this house and have been unable to keep it. It is currently lived in. From the time we moved to 5 years later I have learned that this house has gone through 2 more owners.

My family and I moved into this house in summer of 1992. I remember going to see the house just right before we moved in. When I first walked into the house a tremendous feeling of hostility overcame me. You could tell the house had been picked up/cleaned up as much as the real estate people could to have it viewed. The tile floors were broken. I could tell it had been done purposely. Almost like whom ever did it had taken a hammer to the tiles. The back yard looked completely isolated. As if no one had cared for it in sometime. I noticed a small beat up kids club house. Something told me to leave it alone and continue looking around the house. In the time that I was in that house I felt an overwhelming feeling of uneasiness. It wouldn't be long before I would find out why I felt so uncomfortable and uneasy from the first day I set foot in that door.

We went about 2-3 years without paying attention to things we couldn't explain. Items of clothing disappearing, unexplained noises, our dogs acting strange. Then things got a bit more serious. I remember one night staying up late playing video games. All the lights were off and all that lit up the room was the portable screen from the game console I was playing on. I had this feeling like someone was in the room with me. I was laying down on the couch. It felt like there was someone standing behind me watching me play. I became nervous and quickly turned off my game and hid under my covers. I had the strongest feeling that if I dared to take the covers off and looked I would see something but was unsure as to what. I forced myself to sleep that night.

On another occasion, my mom and brothers had gone to sleep and my step dad (dad) and I were the last ones to go to bed. I turned off the lights and said good night to my dad. He replied back, ""nite"" and there was a short pause. Then a loud and deep voice was heard. I did not make out what it said, but my dad heard it too. I even thought it was him trying to scare me and said, ""haha nice try..."" He told me that had not been him. I think we both got scared and ignored what had happened and just went to sleep.

I refused to sleep in my room after sometime. I always told my mom and dad that it was because I liked sleeping on the couch in the living room and having the tv all to myself. That was not all true. My room had two big windows and for sometime before my dad had that part made into a wall it had a door that went from my closet into the backyard. Whenever I slept in my room I hardly ever got a full nights sleep. I was always woken up by sounds that came from out in the back. Sounds that were not my dog because he slept on the other side by the sliding glass doors. It was whispering. I had a fear that someone or something was watching me or waiting to watch me. I always had the strongest urge to pull up my blinds and get it over with but never found the courage.

There was also a shadow in our home. Now I don't know if it was more than one or just that one, but it was all over our house. I saw this shadow, my mom, dad, 2nd to youngest brother, cousin. They all saw it. It would just walk by. Many times I saw it through the side of my eye. It would be out in the front of the house as well. I think my dog would see it too because he would bark uncontrollably like someone was there. This shadow never did anything to really scare me or others but it made it's presence known to us.

My 2nd youngest brother was given the back room that was right next to mine. He was getting older and wanted his own space. It was the middle of the night and we were all a sleep. Suddenly I woke up to my brother running out of his bedroom crying out for my mom. I saw him pass by and got up to go see what happened to him. I remember him telling my mom as he cried that he had opened his eyes and seen a white cat like animal at the foot of his bed. It was staring at him. My mom tried calming him down by telling him it could have been a pillow. She comforted him and he fell a sleep in her room. As I made my way back to the couch I looked towards the small hallway that lead to me and my brothers room and just froze. I just could not bring myself to go and check.

As our time in that house grew close to an end more and more things became visible. In the restroom that was near the kitchen an image began to show on the green marble floor. It was the outline of an angel. It was so clear from the head to the wings. We even took pictures to show a friend once. Outlines of faces started forming on the wood in the living room. It was no tricks of the mind. We all saw them clearly without having to point them out to each other. They seemed like demonic faces to me. Right before we moved another angel image appeared on the other bathrooms white marble floor. It was as clear as the one in the green marble floor.

My step dad lost that house. The timing could not have come any sooner. We were all overwhelmed and the hostility that the home had was contagious on many occasions. There were times that I did not even know myself anymore. I wish I could say that was the last I saw of the house on W. Elmwood ave. You see this house follows me in my dreams. I have found myself back inside of it numerous times. With horrible things waiting. Horrible things that awaken me until this day and rob me of my sleep.

She Wanted Me To Come To Her,"California, United States",Misc,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Misc :: She Wanted Me To Come To Her

T his is a dream that I had a long time ago when I was around 9 or 10 years old. I am 26 years old now. However the dream starts like this: I was in the living room with my family on a saturday night. I was so happy and since I was the baby of the family, I was standing in front of the couch trying to get all the attention while my family were all sitting down in the couch. The way my Mom's house is designed makes it easy to see all the way into the bedroom if your standing in the living room. I was chatting away and all the lights were on, except for the one in the bedroom. I was looking in the bedroom and I saw a girl. In the dream I wasn't scared nor did I pay much attention to the girl. She was pacing in circles slowly and was motioning for me to come to her. I would look and then turn around and continue chatting with my family ignoring her. She would sigh and look down in disappointment and continue on pacing slowly. She would stop and look at me again and motion for me to come to her. I remember seeing the desperation in her eyes and her pain when I would just turn away from her and ignore her. She was young and she looked like a teenager from the 80's, and what makes it weird is that I did have this dream in the 80's. The girl was blonde and curvy. In the dream I was so happy and this girl was trying really hard for me to go to her.

The next day I mentioned my dream to my Mom. My sister overheard me and it turned out that she had the same exact dream and at the same night. I was amazed.

I was not so supervised though to have had that dream back then, there was always paranormal activity going on in my house around that time. I would hear footsteps and feel scared being in the bedroom. However I do remember that the noises would always occur around 4:30-5:00 am every day. I would be prepared with the lights on and the Television on. My Mom would leave to work at 4:00 in the morning and leave me with my older sister. It was impossible to get good sleep back then.

If anyone can tell me what they think the dream meant related to what was happening at my house back then; I would love to hear feedback.

That One Night : I'm Always With You,Thailand,Family / Friends Visits,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Family / Friends Visits :: That One Night : I'm Always With You

I know that this is not a very scary story, but I think it's very good. It's a true story. I hope that he forgives me for sharing my story with you all. Well, I think he understands.

Ever since my beloved grandfather past away, I couldn't get a hold of myself for weeks. He was the one who loved my the most and cared for me the most because I was his favorite grandchild. I miss him so much. I almost gotten over him until it happened to me.

My grandfather died on my grandmother's anniversary of her death. So you can say that he had waited until that day and then die peacefully. My mother said that it was a miracle that my grandfather died at the same day as my grandmother and that they must've love each other so much that on the day he died, my grandmother was there to take him away. Just thinking about this makes me want to cry.

I know this is a long time, but it's true. Five months had past and I have almost forgotten all about my grandfather. Just almost.

It was a late night and I couldn't sleep. So I stayed up later than I should chatting on the internet. Just when I turned out the light, I saw a shadow. I looked behind me. There was no one. I thought that it was probably just my imagination. So I eventually turned out the light. I lay there on my bed thinking what I should wear tomorrow for school now that I have a boyfriend. I was about to fall asleep when I hear someone calling me. I sat up on my bed. I looked around. I slip back on my back and try to fall asleep. And again. I hear my named being called. I looked at my bedroom door. I went to open the door wondering that the call was from outside. No one. I closed the door and there it is! Sitting on the chair. I was so afraid to look at it that I ran to my bed and cover myself. Then when it sounds like no one was there, I took a peek. No one was there. And then I fell a gust of wind blew past me that messed up my table filled with papers.

The next day I woke up, I had to clean and reorganized my papers. Then I noticed that grandfather's picture was on the chair. When I thought about it, he sat where grandfather always sit to tell me stories. And right then, I noticed that that was grandfather. It's like he wants me to remember that he's always with me.

So now, still, I still know that miracles can happen. (although it did scare me to death when I saw that figure sitting there staring at me: that black shadow was my grandfather)

A Weird Vacation Picture,Ireland,Photographs / Videos / EVP,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Photographs / Videos / EVP :: A Weird Vacation Picture

A s I mentioned in my previous posting, last month a friend and I took a trip to Ireland . Both of us took many pictures in the ten days we were there. About two weeks ago my friend was visiting with me, and we decided to look at the pictures in my camera on the TV. My friend likes to ""zoom in"" on the pictures to see the details -- and WHAT a detail she discovered in a picture of me that was taken the first day we arrived...

We had just driven through The Burren in County Clare, and were driving into County Galway. Along the road we spotted a few cars parked along the side, and curious, we pulled over to see what the other people had stopped to see. It turned out to be a very big and beautiful Faery Ring. Some other women we met there said to me, ""You can really feel 'them' here... "" To make a long story short, my friend took a picture of me with my camera sitting in the Faery Ring, and then we continued on our way into Galway.

The picture was originally a long shot, to get me surrounded by this particular site. But when we zoomed in on the figure of me on the TV two weeks ago, we saw what looks like something climbing up behind me over my head. On close inspection you can actually make out a face, and an arm. I felt nothing at the time, and my friend saw nothing unusual when she took the picture. Needless to say, both my friend and I were shocked to see what we saw in the TV close-up.

I'm sending along a copy of the picture, as close-up as I could make it without distorting anything. I can say now, this picture is not as clear as it was on a big TV screen, but you can see that something -- or someone? -- is definitely there on top of my head. My friend and I checked carefully to see if it might have been a trick of the light or something, but we could not see anything other than what it seems to be. Any opinions, anyone?

They're Still Here,Philippines,Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: They're Still Here

T his is a follow up of my other post since some people have asked me if there was any other experience in this house besides the other one I had.

Right now I'm feeling really creeped out but I'm still gonna continue on writing.

So after that incident a lot of other things have happened. I really can't remember how or in what order it happened but I'm going to write down most of what I remember.

My parents' room has this cabinet with really noisy locks when you move them. Sure enough they'll never move on their own since

they're made of steel and are quite heavy. But one time when all of us were here in the second floor, we can clearly hear something or someone playing with the locks. This happened so many times after that and many of us can hear it.

It still happens in my parents' room. We can hear something being dragged by night so no one usually goes in there except my parents.

But there was this time when my mom and dad had to go out of town for at least 3 days and I was left here with my older cousin. We heard really loud dragging sounds from my parents room but we weren't sure if it came there so we went to out neighbor and asked them what was up. We saw that everyone in their family were in their living room. And the house next to us was a vacant house.

This is probably one of the weirdest... So me and my cousins were playing at my computer when suddenly the stereo busted a loud music! Some CD's were inside and the song that played was in it too. But here's the catch, the stereo wasn't plugged and we hadn't used it for months.

So that's about all the I could remember and if I remember anything else I'll post it.

What Blew In with the Storm,"New Mexico, United States",Misc,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Misc :: What Blew In with the Storm

M y wife and I had just opened our camper that was parked on our driveway in the back, when the tornado sirens went off on May 31st in Minneapolis. We had the cover of this full size camper off and laying on the lawn. We quickly ran in too see the forecast on the local channel. We were expecting tornados and deadly winds, as the storm approached Minneapolis according to the weather station.

My wife and I quickly jumped in to action; I ran out and raised the ladder. I quickly grabbed the protective cover for the camper and dragged it to the side of the camper. Spending much time in the BWCA and wilderness area of the Midwest, I took a moment and stepped in the alley to view the darkening sky. Wow, we had a storm brewing that we have not had for a long time. The static electricity was so great that the hairs were standing up on my arms. At this time I knew we were in for a light show!

My wife quickly ran in to check on her mother (her dear husband was in the hospital and she was really worried about her being alone). I ran up the ladder and started dragging the camper cover up the side, when the air got really still... The sky turned black and I could see the approaching storm clouds velocity growing and turning dark as night. All of the sudden the ladder fell to the ground and I turned, there was little or no wind. I was stranded as the black clouds approached closer and closer, I started calling for my wife who was on the phone trying to get in touch with her mom in the house.

She could not complete the call; the stereo turned up to max volume... And all of her effort to turn down the stereo was fruitless... Because of the volume of the stereo she could not hear me calling for her help as the dark clouds approached while I was stranded 12ft in the air.

Finally as the storm got closer, she came running out to tell me of her terrifying experience with the stereo and noticed me stranded on the camper. Though I have been in many scary predicaments both in my everyday life and the investigations we have conducted, this particular event made me feel very vulnerable and helpless to the powers that be.

My questions would be; Does the static electricity create and intensifies paranormal activities that exist with a powerful storm? Does the fear and vulnerability that people feel during a great storm make them sensitive to paranormal activity? We are a ghost hunting team; could an entity follow us home from a previous investigation? Could it draw strength from a storm? Though it could be explained away easily due to the storm, the wind was not enough to hinder me pulling a large cloth cover up but it was strong enough to topple a metal ladder?

Leprechaun,United Kingdom,Non Human Entities,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Non Human Entities :: Leprechaun

H i, my names Georgie and I'm from England, I'm now 19 and have since moved house. This happened to me when I was 14 and lived in another house. The house was quite big and victorian style and was always quite freaky feel about it. I always hated the night because I always felt as if something was in my room but I would just put my head under the cover and wait until I fell asleep.

Well this particular night I went to bed and done my usual routine and I fell to sleep, I woke up in the middle of the night and I sat up and in front of my bed was my dressing table, I looked at my dressing table and there was a tiny person sitting on there but he was green and it sounds silly but it looked a little like a leprechaun, I looked at it and he looked back at me then when I realized what it was I started screaming and the more I screamed the more it laughed at me, my mum come running in my room and it looked at her and she turned the light on and he disappeared.

I've never seen it since and I just don't know why it was there. It sounds so unreal and everyone I tell thinks I was dreaming, but I know I wasn't. And it was weird how I couldn't take my eyes off it, I was so scared but couldn't look away. I just wondered if anyone has any ideas of what this could have been? Thanks for reading! :)

How Do You Like My House?,"Michigan, United States",Family / Friends Visits,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Family / Friends Visits :: How Do You Like My House?

M y parents weren't sure if they wanted to sell their beautiful bungalow for a cement brick ranch on Mulberry Street. This house belonged to my Uncle Al who had recently passed away and the family offered to sell this house to them at a very low cost. I wasn't too pleased at first. I was always afraid that it was haunted (though it really isn't, it seems now) as it had such a rich past in our family's blood line.

It was built in the 1950's along with many other identical houses on the block, and my grandparents were the first residents. My grandmother had eight children, my mom being the youngest, and one of the five still living today. Not to mention, my grandfather had died of cancer when my mom was eight - she found him black and blue lying inside his bed, but still alive. My grandmother also died of cancer and lived her last months in what is now my bedroom. My Uncle Jim, one of the oldest, was found dying (so to speak) on the couch in the living room - he died in the hospital. My Uncle Al is the only other one to actually spend his last few moments in this house before facing death, but my Uncle Dave died only a few months before he did. They were really close.

Our house at the time was just one busy street away from my uncle's house. The move would be easy and rather inexpensive. We would get more for our cute little house than we would have to pay out later, but it was safe to say we mostly wanted to stay put.

One night I had a very strange dream. I was inside of my Uncle Al's house - it was dark all except for his computer room, which now contained a bed, a dresser, some luggage, and my parents. They were talking and I was thirsty. I made my way into the kitchen - ""Is that you, Dave?""

My first reaction was fear. I could never miss that voice. It was my Uncle Al, and I froze right there in the doorway to the living room. There he was, sitting in his chair with his legs up, his newspaper open, and a full head of hair. His pipe was hanging out of his mouth and I could smell his tobacco. I didn't say a word.

I stood there still, not able to move - not that I wanted to. I was honestly so terrified, you don't even know. All I could think about was how dead he was, how seriously dead. I watched his coffin as it was sealed inside a tomb forever. In a wall. In a cemetery really far away. But there he was clad in dark blue jeans, his (only?) white tennis shoes, black t-shirt with the pocket on the breast for his pipe - the glasses, the paper, the chair...

I could have told him that I love him or that I miss him but instead I remained silent and hoped that it was all just a dream, that I wasn't really seeing a dead guy - even if he was my uncle - sitting in the living room asking me if I was yet another dead guy (again, my uncle) and not looking up from his paper once. I don't think he knew it was me.

My Uncle Al was my favorite - we were really close. He spoiled me and I loved him to death. I visited him frequently. We talked in the backyard about politics. We both loved to play with Furby.

At one point I mustered the courage to bolt straight out of there and into the computer room, at which point I tried to explain to my parents that Uncle Al was reading the paper, but I woke up mid-explanation and realized that it must have been a dream. I wasn't even in the right house.

I stepped out of my room for a glass of water and found myself face to face with my mom - who also seemed a little out of place. We just looked at one another. ""I just had the strangest dream...""

She just stared at me for a moment and then responded, ""Me, too. I had a dream about Al. He was sitting in his living room reading the paper. He wanted to know how I like his house...""

My Ghost Pets,"Illinois, United States",Pets / Animals,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Pets / Animals :: My Ghost Pets

W hen I was five, I got a great rabbit that we named Elvis. He was a lopp rabbit with tan ears and patches of fur, a mainly white colored, and a minimal amount of black fur. I spent all of my time with him, except school, meals, and sleeping. He would run around my legs in circles, giving out little happy-grunts.

As I aged, he did too. He was still running around, nails clacking on our basement floor, just like the happy-go-lucky bunny he was. One day when I was nine (3/4), I was talking about what we would do with him when he passed away.

I then went to my basement to play video games, and I looked over at his cage and saw him laying against the front of it. I went over to pet him, and I saw that his eyes were closed. Being that he was 7 years old, which is a long life for a lopp rabbit, I knew he had passed away, less than half an hour after I played with him last.

My family was very sad, and we got him cremated and buried his ashes in our backyard. I cried for the next couple nights, and I guess he saw that I was and gave me signs that he was ok. I had dreams about him, as well as the rest of my family, and I occasionally heard the clinking of his toenails in our basement.

One dream that I remember, though it is vaguely remembered, was the night after his death. I was playing with him again in the basement, though in my dream I still knew he was in heaven, and I just felt that he was ok.

A couple month's later, I got a new guinea pig named Cocoa. She was nice, and she always liked it when I was around. The only thing bad I noticed was that she wouldn't walk into the area where Elvis's cage was. Around the end of her life, though I didn't know it was, she started to lick my thumb when I pet her. When we had her for seven months, she was acting a little weird, so we took her to the vet.

She had an upper respiratory system infection. After this, I made sure that I played with her more often and checked what she was eating was safe for her. Only nine months after we got her, she died. I had no idea she would, because it was so sudden, but earlier that day I just felt that we needed to take some pictures of her with us.

Then, only an hour after the last picture, she started to suffocate in my hands, making weird shrieking and choking sounds. We prayed for her as she left our world, and she went as peacefully as she could. The next couple of days, I had dreams of her and I'm in my basement, I heard squeaking sounds and occasionally felt something on my thumb, which I expected was her spirit.

To this day, I haven't experienced anything but I still pray for both of them.

Hauntings in an Abandoned Town,"Alabama, United States",Ghost Hunting,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Ghost Hunting :: Hauntings in an Abandoned Town

T his story is about a rather small abandoned town. This town is called ""Old Dora..."" Now, I know I have mentioned this town before, but in that story, I only talked about what was going on inside the old methodist church there. This time. I'm going to tell you some of the things that have happened in and around the other buildings around Old Dora. I guess we'll first start off with the old furniture store.

Me and my cousin Sean had been ghost hunting a few weeks back, so we decided to go and check out some of the old buildings in the forgotten town. So, we hopped into my car and drove down there. We parked in front of the old furniture store.

We couldn't go in the top floor, it was falling in and we didn't want to risk having it fall in with us, so we went back behind the building to find an open basement door. We walked inside, and there was an instant chill in the air. Well, we started walking around, trying to communicate with the spirits and such, and then I walked into the middle of the basement. There was nothing around me that I could have snagged myself on. I have a wallet chain. And as I was standing there looking towards the stairs that went us to the first floor. I felt a tug at my chain. I looked back to see if it was Sean, but Sean was on the other side of the room. I looked down in time to see my chain hovering in the air beside my waste, but then it fell back into place.

I told Sean about it excitedly, so we decided maybe to go up the stairs to the first floor and see if we could see anything. So, I start walking up the stairs, and as soon as I reach the top one, Sean goes. ""Whoa!"" And then he jumps down and starts running towards the back of the room. I asked what it was and he said he saw a black shadow looking figure crouching down and as soon as he noticed it it took off, but there was nothing in the room, and nowhere it could have hid.

There is a building right beside the furniture store, but this place is locked up tightly. Well, we decided to joke around, so I knocked on the wood they had placed over the windows and said, ""Anybody home?"" As soon as I finished my sentence, something knocked back at us. It couldn't have been somebody messing around, because this building has been locked up since the town was first abandoned. That and it's locked up so securely, I doubt anyone could have gotten inside.

Now for our last portion of this story, the train station. The top floor of this building is gone completely, rotted away. So, we shimmied our way over to the stairs leading down to the basement. The stairs looked like something out of a horror movie, they were tilted to the side. Well, we walked down there to find that the floor was now nothing more than a huge pile of rubbish. I hopped over onto this old mattress and stared up at the large hole in the ceiling which would have been the first floor's floor. And suddenly from the opposite direction of the door, meaning whatever did this was on the other side of the very large hole no one could get across. I'm just standing there, and I hear these footsteps... Soft at first, but as they neared the large hole, they got heavier,. And an old magazine fell from the hole and landed at my feet. It was an old Time magazine.

Well, that pretty much wraps up some of the things that have happened in that old abandoned town, hope you liked it. Be safe and happy hauntings.

Unexplained Happening in the Workplace,"Texas, United States",Poltergeists / Physical Manifestations,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Poltergeists / Physical Manifestations :: Unexplained Happening in the Workplace

I n the summer of 2007, I moved from Arizona to Texas to go to school. My work fortunately had an office in Irving, TX that I transferred to, so I was guaranteed a job when I moved there. The office where I worked was part of a large, three-story building located in an area of the city of Irving called Las Colinas. It's known as being the ""rich"" area, and as far as I heard from native Texans, the community is relatively new, and the building where I worked built only in the last few years. I don't really know why I would have experienced a haunting there, if that's indeed what it was.

The office where I worked was on the second floor. From the first day I started there, I had a weird feeling about the second floor women's restroom and also the elevators. I noticed almost immediately that many times when I approached the elevators, the doors would open of their own accord without me pressing the button. I thought at first that maybe someone else had pressed the button and then had second thoughts about riding it because they forgot something at their desk or some other reason. But then I realized that if someone does press the button it stays lighted up until the elevator arrives on that floor, and I noticed the elevators were doing this to me even when the button wasn't lit up.

You have to understand, though, that the owners were refurbishing the lobby area, and there was quite a bit of construction going on. It's quite possible that the construction was messing up the electrical system. I still didn't like riding the elevator when that happened. It's hard to explain, but it felt like I was being invited on.

The second floor women's restroom felt even spookier than the elevator, though it looked like nothing more than a normal, large, industrial restroom like you would find in any office or public building anywhere else. There were ten stalls, a sink area, and a maintenance closet. The whole thing was run on sensors, which again, could explain some of the happenings. I didn't like going in there alone and was kind of scared of the maintenance closet for some reason, but I thought I was being silly. Then I started hearing other people talking and saying they felt the same way.

My boss, who sometimes had to work on Saturdays or late in the evening when no one was there, got to the point where she would use the downstairs bathroom after hours because the one upstairs was freaking her out. When we went in to use the restroom and we were alone, the toilets all around us would start flushing. Faulty sensors, we thought. The only problem is, those sensors are set to go off based on movement. What would make them go off if there was no movement?

In addition, I'd sometimes notice the maintenance closet door was closed when I went into a stall, and then it would be open when I came out. I checked to make sure it was the kind of door that closed firmly and it was.

As I already said, all this could be explained by electrical cross-wiring and faulty sensors. Then, on the very last day, I worked there, something happened that wasn't so easily explained. Ironically, it also happened to be October 31, though I don't know if that had anything to do with it.

My boss had taken me out for a farewell lunch. I had gathered all my stuff from my desk and was heading out the door when I decided to use the bathroom since it was a 40-mile drive to where I was going.

When I entered, I went down to the handicap stall, which was the very last one. I knew that no one was in the restroom because all the other stalls had the doors standing open and were empty. In addition, the restroom had one of those heavy-duty doors that they put on public restrooms, the kind that can't be opened quietly, so you can always hear if someone comes in. I was there in the stall, everything quiet, no one else in there, when all of a sudden, I heard the motor to the paper towel dispenser operate up at the front of the restroom.

I think my heart stopped beating for a moment before logic returned. ""Faulty sensor"", I thought, the usual explanation for weird bathroom incidents in this building. I thought there was an air-conditioning vent above the sink, and if there was any paper towel hanging down from the dispenser, the air could have stirred it and made the sensor go off. Easy enough to explain. I hadn't heard any come in, but I peered under the stall I was in anyway and didn't see feet anywhere in the bathroom. I relaxed.

That explanation lasted all of thirty seconds because I suddenly heard a piece of paper towel being ripped off the dispenser!

Okay, that was not a faulty sensor. I know my heart stopped beating at that point. I gathered my stuff up and decided to make a run for it. The only problem was, I had to go by the sink to get out the restroom door, and I was scared to death of what I would see. I took a deep breath and opened the door. There was nothing there, but as I ran past the sink, I saw a piece of paper towel positioned neatly on the counter between the two sinks.

I was glad to leave. Now, several months later, it's just an incident I can't explain. I'm still open to the possibility of someone playing a joke on me. But I don't know how they did it since I would have been aware of anyone coming through the restroom door and that's the only way into the bathroom.

Whispering Ghost,"Florida, United States",Apparitions / Voices / Touches,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Apparitions / Voices / Touches :: Whispering Ghost

T his has happened to my sister, January 5, I think, 2007. Our parents were out. It was winter break for us here in Lake Worth. We recently moved without any history on where this house was built, as the development was new, too. It was about 9 PM and my siblings were playing the sims 2 while I was in the guest room (next to the front door) playing Zelda on the Wii.

The living room is right across from the front door, where the kids were. My sister begins to hear whispers in the direction of the front door, telling her (by her name) to let him in. She looks, but nothing was there. She also heard a banging sound on the glass door. I didn't hear anything, and neither did my brother, who was right next to her. She goes to eat something and hears it, even closer. She told me to stop, that's when I heard her crying. I had no idea what she was talking about. When she realized that, we all called our parents and they came home. She heard it one more time, then it all ended and hasn't happened since.

None of us heard anything at all. We were all huddled together, very scared. My sister tried calling it out, that night last year, but it still persisted... I myself am scared something horrible will come sooner or later... Any ideas please?

Ghost of a Past Resident,"Indiana, United States",Psychic / Medium,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Psychic / Medium :: Ghost of a Past Resident

T his is my first time posting however I love to ready everyone else's stories. I have lived in the same town on the same block my whole 25 years of life. I lived with my parents for 19 years and then purchased a home directly across the street from my parents so my son would be around his grandparents and great grandparents.

When we purchased the house it had sat vacant for almost five years. Needless to say it was in need of some major renovations. I was working 3rd shift and trying to do renovations to the residence at the same time so it took about five months to get everything finished but when we did it looked brand new and it was very nice.

Well I still lived with my parents while doing the renovations. One night I was walking over to the house from my parents to do some work. It was on a saturday night, I remember this because I had weekends off. As I was walking across the street I noticed that there was a light on, which wasn't uncommon because my father would leave the light on for security reasons. I got to the front step of the house and as I walked up it to get the front door I noticed something out of the corner of my eye. When I turned to look there was a man standing in my living room. The only description I have was the subject was approximately 6 foot tall. Just as fast as I saw it, it disappeared. I immediately grabbed the front door, unlocked it, and went inside to find out who was in my house that wasn't supposed to be there.

I looked all over my house but couldn't find anything. The back door was dead bolted from the inside and all the windows were shut and locked from the inside. I couldn't really make out a good description because it happened so suddenly, but I do believe I know who he is. Approximately six to seven years prior, a family had lived there. A mother a father and a set of twins, brother and sister. The father who was a tall man had a heart attack in the front room and died right there in the front room due to the heart attack and head trauma.

I remember all this because my dad and I were standing outside doing yard work one day when the daughter came running to us and said that her dad had fallen in the front room and was bleeding from hitting the coffee table. He passed away right there in front of my dad and I while we did CPR waiting for the medics to get there. The family had went down hill after that day and had to move out due to foreclosure several years later. That was the ghost that I saw.

I never really believed in ghosts and even after that sighting, I didn't believe until I had a few friends come over that claimed to be mediums. I hadn't told them anything about my house except that I wanted them to come over and see if they could figure anything out. I was still a skeptic at that time. They came in and within minutes had told me almost verbatim what had happened ten years or so prior. My jaw dropped in disbelief. I am now a believer. Ever since that reading five years ago I started noticing things that most others around me hadn't. I now believe that I have certain abilities that, prior to about three years ago I just pushed off as coincidence.

Shortly after moving in, my son's mother, who has moved out and left my son and I, were sitting in the living room one day watching television and we heard a very strange sound coming from the attic. It sounded like someone had rolled something from the living room, which is in the front of the house, all the way back to the back bedroom. That distance is approximately 45 feet in a straight line if you are in the attic. My father and I had been up there several months earlier doing the renovations that I talked about and I remember taking EVERYTHING out of there. I know we had taken everything out of there because we had been all over that attic running new wiring due to the house only having like five outlets in the entire house. I know that there wasn't anything up there. I forgot to mention that the entire attic is covered in about six inches of blown in insulation to keep the house warm in the winter due to us having some very cold winters. That is the other odd thing, with all the insulation covering the entire attic how did anything make a noise up there.

Well the day that we heard the sound my ex wanted me to get up there and check it out but at the time I was too scared to. A few months later my father and I had to get up there again to run some more wiring and I had forgot about the whole incident and we were working on the master bedroom, the back bedroom, and as we were crawling back there, I shined my light back there to see where the electric drop was and there was a coffee can. I know that there wasn't anything in there so how did it get there and more importantly how did it make all that noise when there is six inches of insulation all over the attic. Just so you know, when we heard the sound it was a clear winter day, and we heard it roll from the front room to the back bedroom.

There are more stories but I will post them in another story. Believe me, ever since realizing what I can see and hear that most can't, a lot of weird things have happened to me. Weird things have happened to me my entire life, but I never paid attention until now.

The Little Boy in the Haunted House,"Ohio, United States",Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: The Little Boy in the Haunted House

I 've been living in my house for about... 6 years, I think. And so on my birthday, I over heard my dad talking to my aunt and her fiance, and he said that when I was taking a shower, he asked my mom if she wanted something to drink for dinner, and then he just hears a little boy say, ""I want coke, Daddie...""

When I got out, he asked me if I said that I wanted coke for dinner. I told him no and he told my mom and I got creeped out. I asked him if there's a ghost in the house. And I know he lied to me because the next night, I just heard a little boy ask if I wanted to play with him. I turn on my T.V. and then it just turns off, but I didn't even touch the remote.

I know now that it's haunted. And every time I take a shower, I don't scratch my legs, and I end up with HUGE scratches on my stomach and legs, and sometimes on my arms. I tell my mom and she just says it's just because I take hot showers, but I don't anymore. Then I learned that before we moved into the condo, a guy across from us, shot himself because he was really depressed and there might have been something else, too, but I'm not to sure.

I'm not scared anymore because I know that there's more than one ghost, but one of them's my dogs, and the other ones my Great Grandma, G.G. But I'm not sure who the other one is. I know its not the person who killed himself.

Life of Terror: Journal of the Haunted 2,"California, United States",A Haunted Life,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: A Haunted Life :: Life of Terror: Journal of the Haunted 2

T his story is a follow-up of Life of Terror: Journal of the Haunted

12/25/07 I went to take a shower when I started to fell a sharp pain down my body, I look in the mirror and I saw scratches forming on my body. So I got my clothes on and call my friend, who is a priest, to help me to get rid of ""her"". 10pm we started the exorcism that's when all hell broke loose, the lights started to flicker, the house started to shake, the screams started to echo through out the house, then the light bulbs exploded, the mirrors exploded, my friend fainted, so I picked him up and started to run. The doors started to slam one by one, then finally we made it outside and we started to pray even more until a bright light burst out of every window and door of my house. Then it went quiet but I still feel like something is still there waiting, sleeping, and if something is sleeping it will some day wake up and that starts part 3 of my life of terror and I'm on my own for this fight because my friend die shortly after the exorcism and I will always miss him.

Months went by without any disturbance until my 16th birthday. 3/20/08 9pm I was watching a movie with my ex girl friend (she broke up with me in April because she thought I was a freak). We were watching a movie when we started to smell smoke, we search the house and there was nothing. Then we look out to the back yard and we saw what it look like a figure with long hair covering the face, as soon I turn on the light, it ran off when I chased it, it was gone. There was two ways out, through the back door, the one that I was blocking, and the gate, but the gate was pad lock and it's too tall to jump over.

3/29/08 7pm I was laying down listening to music when my closet door started to shake, it shook harder and harder then it broke off and fell into the closet, breaking every single one of my sister dolls (I promise her I keep them safe until she comes back for them). The next day I was cleaning up the doll mess when someone or something try to throw a piece of broken glass at me but I got out of the way in time, then as soon as I got up, my year book flew in the air and almost hit me in the head.

More College Street Occurances,"North Carolina, United States",Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: More College Street Occurances

I n my last story, Shadow People and Webby encounter I touched base with things that happened in the past. I did have doubts about the Old Hag in that story, and it has come back recently, but never in my own bed. Now I am able to wake myself and make it stop, it just doesn't have the same hold over me as it once had.

When I was pregnant, I had an experience when I woke up in the spare bedroom hearing a door slam. As I sat up and cleared my head, I heard the sound of dog toe nails scrapping on linoleum. It sounded like a large dog, like a Labrador. It sounded like the click - clack of nails. I grabbed a metal pole belonging to a disassembled shelf, and searched my apartment. I was scared because an animal really had to be disillusioned maybe rabid to go up steps to get into this place. There was no dog. I know it wasn't my neighbor's dog because it is kennel trained, and is a small dog, I did find out later that she had put her dog in a facility and went out of town that Friday as well.

I dismissed the idea eventually and had nearly forgotten it until about two weeks ago. We were having a series of small fast moving thunderstorms, tornadoes, and high winds. Being this house isn't the sturdiest of constructions, as it is old and in some disrepair, (landlord is VERY OLD) I called my mom to come get me and the baby. When she got here, I was finishing packing up my diaper bag when we heard the back door slam, HARD. The floor in the back of the place is sinking with the house. If you set a ball on the floor it rolls towards the back of the kitchen. So when I open the back door to get the air moving in the house, as I had that day, or even when it is open just two feet, it is wedged very well into the floor and does not move without a good bit of effort. There is no way the wind could have moved that door, I had it as far open as I could possibly make it go, so it was wedged good! As my mom and I headed to the back, we heard the dog steps. When we got to the dining room, and as I checked the door, my mother got very uncomfortable and insisted we go. She said she felt like something didn't want us there. She thinks it might have even been a protective force with the storm brewing and all.

Another thing to happen recently, I heard the front door close, the distinct sound of sleigh bells I have on it. Then I hear Jeff's computer chair move as if he had gotten up and the chair bumped the desk. Then I hear steps down the hallway, and sounded like Jeff's clunky way of tromping around the house with keys and change jingling. I called out to him... No answer. So I get up out of bed, peek into the living room, and there is nobody. I looked in the back of the house, nobody. I called Jeff's cell phone and asked if he had just been home, and he said he hadn't, he was in Henderson. This has started happening at least once a week. I don't know what to think of it.

Something else freaking me out is that darn nursery! There are some times when I feel something not good is watching me and my son as I feed him. Maybe it is vulnerability because I breast feed? One time, when he was close to newborn, maybe a month and a half I got that bad feeling, and suddenly his eyes got really big and it seemed he was staring at something, and he was whimpering. I was frozen in fear at the time, and I visualized a protective shield around the both of us, and slowly got up and went to my bed with the baby, acting as if all was normal. Now he tracks things while in there, but that might be something else like the float things in your eyes. Now I am scared to put him to bed in there, and it is supposed to be time to get him to sleep in his own room.

This place was great before I had a baby, exciting and interesting, but now I can't wait to move! We're planning on it in the fall, but I need some advice on what to do until then!

I had safeguarded my room, but not without difficulties. That is when the Old Hag was the worst. If anyone has a way to make it so I don't have to worry about my son or I being threatened in any way that would be great.

Great Grandfathers Ghostly Visit,"West Virginia, United States",Family / Friends Visits,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Family / Friends Visits :: Great Grandfathers Ghostly Visit

I was 6 years old when I saw my first ghost or spirit. I was riding my bike around in the basement of the house that we lived in which my father had built in 1961. I am an only child so I was very comfortable roaming around alone and finding things to do. My point here is even at 6 years old I did not frighten easily. I was riding around the length of the basement several times, on my last pass around I looked up and saw a man sitting on this stone and brick seating area my father built square in the middle of the basement. I was not frightened just shocked, he was sitting with his arms and elbows resting on his knees hunched over. He was wearing old bib overalls and a red and black checked flannel shirt and old worn work boots. His head and face seemed to be badly scarred as if he had been burned. I sat there for a minute looking at him and he finally looked up at me, it was almost like he did not know I was there, he stared straight at me and this look of anger came over his face and he said ""Come here little girl"".

Well that's when I became hysterical, covering my eyes and screaming for my dad. I finally got the courage to look and he was gone. I ran to my dad in the other end of the house screaming ""Daddy there is a man in the house"". Well he looked and looked; all windows and doors were as they should be. Dad chalked it up to imagination as did my mother. But my beloved grandmother (my mom's mother) listened intently when I told her about the man. She told me very sternly ""If you ever see him again run, he is a bad man"". I never questioned it further I just obeyed because grandma's word was law.

Years later when I was about 17 my mother and I were going through my grandmothers house to clean things after her death. I found a photo of a man and woman in farm clothing from what looked like the 1800's. I instantly recognized the man in the photo as the man in the basement when I was 6. I ran to my mom and said “this is him, the man I seen when I was 6 and nobody except grandma believed me.”

My mother said he was her grandfather, her mother’s father, and that he was not a nice man. He was very abusive and my grandmother never liked to speak of him. My mother continued to tell me that both he and my great grandmother (the lady in the picture) died when their house caught fire while the children were at school one day. My grandma and her bother were sent to live with their aunt. Needless to say I was pretty creeped out that the man I saw was scarred from what looked like burns and was very angry that I was in his space.

I have never seen him again to this day. Since then I have seen a lot of paranormal activity that I cannot explain. I sometimes enjoy the experiences and sometimes not so much. God has seen fit to give me a great gift for a reason even if I do not always understand it. I feel very blessed. Thanks for listening. It’s nice to have a forum where people actually are interested in your experiences versus freaked out by them.

Weird Happenings at Home 2,Kuwait,Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: Weird Happenings at Home 2

T his is the continuation of my previous story. A lot of things have been happening since my last post and I would like to tell them to you.

The tap hasn't turned on again (thankfully) but many weird things have been happening which I can't explain. A few months ago, my mom and dad were in the living room watching T.V. (My mom told me this story) my father got bored so he went into the balcony. The balcony is behind the couch on which my mom was sitting. After a while, my mom heard a ""click"". She ignored it thinking it was something else. After a while, when my father tried to come out of the balcony, he found the door locked! The only way you can lock the door is by turning a key in the door. My father started banging on the door so my mom opened the door. He asked her who locked the door but she said she had no clue. And there was no one home except my dad and mom. So this really freaked me out! Nowadays, I have started to hear those ""clicking"" noises that my mom heard. The only clicking noise comes when you lock the balcony door! So this was really weird!

Other things have also been happening like a marble rolling on the top floor (only an old man lives there), furniture moving sounds above us, something or someone falling, etc. This we can hear from my and my brother's room and from my parent's room. It is really weird because when we asked him what he was doing all the time; at midnight, or at 5:00 am, he said he wasn't doing anything. He never moved his furniture or anything else. I really feel confused! Please can somebody tell me what's going on?! I will keep informing you guys about what's going on!

Spirit Attack,"California, United States",Old Hags / Night Attacks / Sleep Paralysis,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Old Hags / Night Attacks / Sleep Paralysis :: Spirit Attack

I 'm 17 years old and a special kind of ghost hunter. This story took place in 2001; I was about 7 years old. I had just watched the movie ""The 6th Sense"" with my 6 year old brother and my mother. I had asked my mom if I can sleep down here in the living room, because the house was cold and we had a fire going on at the time to make things warm. My mother told me I could sleep down stairs and my brother asked me if I could get his things to so he can sleep down there to. I was being mean to him and told him ""No you can get it yourself..."" My mother then told me to get his things, not able to say no to her I headed up stairs (we had a two story house) to get our things.

Once I made it to the top of stairs, my body felt heavy and I was unable to move any part of my body. Since I had already turned to look in to the room (the door was open at the time) and my right arm was very close to the switch that turns on the light in mine and my brothers room, I saw a figure come from my side of the room. It looked like it was an old lady carrying a hunter's knife. The old woman looked like she was wearing a veil and a white dress; it may have been a mourning dress (the dress women wear to a funeral). The woman slowly made her way to me.

Paranoid as I was I had never been attacked by a ghost and did not understand why I could not speak or move any parts of my body. During the time I was missing my brother wondered where I was, he came up the stairs and started talking to me, once he saw the woman he froze too. About 5 minutes later I moved my hand and turned on the bedroom light, the woman then disappeared. Freaked out as I was I ran down the stairs with my brother following right behind me and we told our mother what we saw.

She went up and investigated and found nothing. Once we got our things we went back down stairs they acted as if nothing happened, I thought I heard some one quietly laugh as they walked away. The next morning I found a scar on my left arm near the elbow, it looks like a hunter knife cut it. To this day I don't know what it was that attacked me.

Ghost Of Pulau Ubin,Singapore,Apparitions / Voices / Touches,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Apparitions / Voices / Touches :: Ghost Of Pulau Ubin

T his is the first time I am telling my paranormal experiences to the public. I wish that you like my story. My two friends, Ying Jie and Marcus are paranormal investigators, so am I. We always wanted to go to Pulau Ubin to find some ghosts because we went to the internet and we found some ghost encounters there.

It was a windy night and we were heading to Pulau Ubin on a boat. We packed our bag full of our paranormal gear like ghost detector, mirror and red chopsticks (if a ghost possess one of us, we will use it).

When we got there, it was dark; we took out our torch light and made our way to a bicycle shop to rent a bike. After renting a bike, we cycle to a dark area and suddenly, a dark object jumped out of the bushes and chased us. We rode like mad racers rushing to the finishing line.

After a few minutes later, it was gone, gone for good. We rushed back to the bicycle shop at full speed. We returned our bikes and ran to the boat port to take a boat back to Singapore. When we were about to leave the port, the dark object appeared out of nowhere and was about to chase us again but luckily, we was leaving the port on the time it appear, we were lucky!

Please leave some comments; I will be posting more true stories of my own paranormal experience.

Energy Loss,"Oklahoma, United States",Apparitions / Voices / Touches,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Apparitions / Voices / Touches :: Energy Loss

T his related back to my other post, Feeling Voices. I've listened to all of your suggestions to try and contact this spirit that is trying so hard to get my attention. I tried a couple of times before, to verbally and mentally make contact. Since I heard these voices in my head, I thought talking back to them in my head might be suiting. But up until last night I had gotten nothing.

Last night I went to bed after staying up rather late watching TV. As I was lying in bed, I decided to give contact with the spirit another go. I said, ""If there's anyone here that wants to speak with me, now is your chance..."" Nothing happened for a long moment as I concentrated on trying to hear what the entity was trying to say to me.

All of a sudden, it felt like all of my energy had been completely drained, and pain burst through my head. It frightened me, so I think maybe this made the entity back off for a moment, because I felt some of my energy come back, but then it soon it started back up again. For the moment it felt like the room had dropped a couple of degrees, and then I felt the tingling sensation on the side of my face again.

I could feel something with me in the room, and it frightened me. I don't think the presence here is meaning to do this, because soon after I was very, very calm. Calm enough to go to sleep. It might have been comforting me, somehow. Maybe using the energy it took to comfort me, to make up for the fright it caused?

I'm a believer at heart, but a skeptic by nature. My heart is telling me there is a spirit with me, but my mind is telling me that this was just a nightmare, or the little freak-outs I'm prone to when I see something even vaguely supernatural.

I really am interested as to what you guys think. Is the entity with me becoming stronger, or am just the victim of my over-indulgent imagination?

Christmas Child,United Kingdom,Apparitions / Voices / Touches,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Apparitions / Voices / Touches :: Christmas Child

I was around ten years old when this occurred. Now thirteen, I've always thought that seeing a ghost must be incredibly scary. However, when I encountered meeting a ghost at the end of my bed on Christmas night 2007, now looking back, I don't get the shivers at all!

It was late on Christmas night, after my presents had been delivered into my stocking. And, you know you get that exciting feeling of getting lots and lots of presents? Well, that is exactly what I had, and I kept waking up.

Around the fourth time I woke up, I propped my head up from my pillow, only to find a little girl rummaging through my stocking. I looked harder, and began to shake my head frantically, to see if she might disappear. I began to shiver, and she kept turning her head, browsing the presents, even though they were wrapped in paper.

Everyone thinks that ghosts are transparent, don't they? Well, strangely, this one was opaque!

Thank you for reading my story, you probably thought it wasn't even rather interesting, but, I would like to read your thoughts and comments.

The Condo,"California, United States",Apparitions / Voices / Touches,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Apparitions / Voices / Touches :: The Condo

I live in San Francisco, CA in an old section of town in a relatively new condo built in 1989. My husband brought home a charm at Christmas time, 1995 that a friend who was experimenting with dark arts made and he set it on a glass entry table.

By February, 1996, the energy activated by the charm came into full bloom. For instance, I took off a pair of earrings one evening and set them on the arm rest of a chair. They were gone the next morning and then reappeared shortly thereafter on the ottoman beside the chair.

The energy became more aggressive. My beloved cat and I were in the dining area. We heard a distinct ""meow"" and my cat began to walk toward the noise. My cat became more and more under attack, ultimately with the lid of his litter box was turned upside down into the litter so that he could not use the box. He was very distressed by the attacks he was under, and was observant of the unseen energy around him.

The door of the oven opened overnight. I heard raging around sounds in the living room at 4 in the morning. The back of the entertainment unit was pulled being away; I could hear it being pulled out. I saw a red warrior metal type entity with a shield for a split second marching toward the charm on the entry table. There are knocking sounds above my head while showering or dressing in the morning.

Finally in April 1996, I contacted a spiritual source and was told to take the charm away at the new moon and place it in a crossroads, which turned out to be in a trash can near a metro stop. I then cleansed the house with white sage.

Some of the harassment stopped but it still exists. Now my husband and I both heard a wind, like a hissing sound from the closet area where the entity stays most of the time.

The energy tried to enter me while I was lying down, causing a heightened experience of color and forms. I lay down on the bed and heard a bang. The entity caused a noise from the metal bed frame, and then moved the covers. I felt a chopping (blade?) experience in my mid section.

We have heard clicks and bangs throughout the house. Recently, the entity marched towards me close up - I felt it - and caused the floor to vibrate. A favorite ploy it has is to activate the computer from sleep to ready mode.

How can I rid my home from this energy that has been here for 10 plus years?The energy is definitely not good.

A Dream Of The Devil,"Florida, United States",Apparitions / Voices / Touches,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Apparitions / Voices / Touches :: A Dream Of The Devil

O ne night when I was sleeping, I had a dream of a devil. It had white horns, a mark on his forehead, and a mark on his chest. Its body was all black and it was smiling at me like he wanted to kill me. When I woke up, I was sweating and I was scared to death. This happened May 2, 2008 after me and my friends talked about demons and ghosts. We also found out that Devil backwards is LIVED. What does this mean?

After I dreamed about that, I started seeing shadows. Stuff has been following me around. Boxes and bags are falling out of my closet. When I was eating cereal, I went to my sister to ask her if I could use her brush, I heard my spoon move and when I returned, my cereal was shaped into a happy face with triangle eyes.

I saw a little girl with pale skin, a black dress and a white bow in her hair. Another girl I have seen is about 13 and has been following me around, she's just a shadow. A little boy has been following me around also.

I don't why this is happening or what they want from me. My father told me that when the priest came to bless the house he said that there was something wrong with my brother's closet, that there was a demonic presence. All the stuff that has happened to me has occurred near my brother's bedroom. Are his closet and my friends and I the reason why?

Asking To See Others,"Virginia, United States",Family / Friends Visits,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Family / Friends Visits :: Asking To See Others

I have always heard that if someone has passed that before you go to sleep at night you can ask God to let you dream of them. There is a reason for me asking help from the contributors of this sight as I have read a lot of posts that some of you have written. If someone on here doesn't know then I am lost.

My Granny that I wrote about in my story ""A Husbands Last Promise"" died almost 2 years ago and my Papa died almost 9 years ago. I have never dreamt of my Papa and I have only dreamt of my Granny once.

About two months after she died, my kids and I were leaving from my parent's house. It was about 9 pm and it only takes me about 15 minutes to get home. When I was about 2 miles from home, I was going through a traffic light and was almost hit by a transfer truck. The driver had run the red light and luckily, he was able to stop about a foot from my vehicle. This scared me to death and I was shaking for the rest of the way home. When I got home, I called my parents to let them know that we had made it home and about what had happened.

I don't know if it was because of the trauma that had happened earlier but that night was the only time I have ever had a dream involving my Granny. In my dream, she was dead and she was lying in her bed at the house. There was a golden broach that was pinned on her dress. I didn't like the placement of the broach so I moved it. When I did, my Granny opened her eyes and started gasping for air. This freaked me out and my mother closed her eyes and kept repeating, ""I'm not seeing this, this isn't happening"". My Granny kept telling me to come and touch her, that she wasn't cold anymore. I told her no and got in my car and left.

When I got about 2 miles down the road, I looked and Granny was sitting in the passenger seat of my car. She told me that she wanted to come home with me because now everyone thought that she was dead and she couldn't go back home. I told her that I was sorry and that she couldn't come home with me. I dropped her off at a little diner and just drove off.

I want to dream about her and to let her know that she is welcome to come to my house. I want to be able to dream about her, even if it is about things that happened years ago. I just want to be able to see her again.

Thornewood Castle,"Washington, United States",Ghost Tours & Haunted Hotels,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Ghost Tours & Haunted Hotels :: Thornewood Castle

B uilt in 1908 by Chester A. Thorne, this 27, 000 square foot manor is of the Gothic Tudor style and is the only one of its kind on the west coast. Chester Thorne, one of the founders of the Port of Tacoma, and the first president of National Bank of Tacoma (later National Bank of Washington), built this home for his wife. Since the construction many notable guests have stayed within the beautiful brick walls. Both President William Howard Taft and Theodore Roosevelt are just two to mention.

Pieces of this castle, like the staircase and stained glass, date as far back as 400 years. Construction took three years to complete, from 1908 to 1911, with many of the materials, including the brick, oak paneling, oak staircase and the medieval stained glass coming from a castle in Europe. Mr. Thorne spent a substantial amount of time, and money, collecting the glass from the 15th to the 17th centuries. These artifacts were previously owned by a Duke who spent 40yrs collecting them.

We had a chance to stay at the Thornewood Castle on Monday, October 24th, 2005; two days after our wedding date. My husband and I started our group in that very same month, with only two cameras, two small dictation tape recorders, and big ideas surrounding the two of us. Although we had been investigating two years prior, with various groups in our state, we did not become official until this date. We like to keep it simple, our anniversary for our wedding is October 22nd, 2005, and therefore we chose to have our group's anniversary October 22nd as well. We remained a ""mom and pop"" paranormal team for approximately a year, and then we began to build and expand. Today we have a few close core members: Curtis Gibson, Nikki Henderson, Joe Heithe, Julie Destefano, Kate McClure, Kristin Reeck, and Steven Johnston.

Mrs. Deanna Robinson, Thornewood's current owner, held a Candle Light Mystery Tour on the evening of October 24th, 2005; what better way to have a Honeymoon than with spirits, candles and tales? We joined in for an investigative styled tour from the basement to the old top floor living quarters built for the servants. The tour extended out into the secret garden and surrounding grounds of the Castle.

The tour started with a fabulous dinner held in the formal dining room, at 7PM. My husband and I, David and Regan Vacknitz, observed a few other guests present for these evenings' events. There were two ladies, from Canada, one single lady venturing out to complete a desire to stay at the castle, and a reporter for the Tacoma Home and Garden magazine. We discussed why we were there over a display of aromas, sites, and textures to make any palate salivate with desires. While we ate we were educated on some of the history of the castle, the past and current owners, and the story of ""Rose Red: Stephen King...""

After supper, with the plates being cleared, and as the rich desserts began digesting in our gullets, we gathered our equipment, and ventured out. We started in the basement where we learned of the local Native American tribes that blessed the castle. In the past, the tribes used this land as their annual gathering to come together, trade, and share with one another. One of the oddest things to learn of the castle was the story behind the wishbone shaped ""good luck charms..."" The story told was that during some construction in 1910s, some of the Native Americans working on the castle was believed to have left small good luck totems in the shape of wishbones throughout the basement of the Castle. To this day, the wishbones can be found sporadically and intentionally placed.

We moved to the entrance level of the castle, where we learned of the first spirit to be seen walking amongst the living. Beneath the grand stair case is a small, almost unnoticeable, restroom. Strategically placed the bathroom is almost incognito with the rest of the rich grained wood. This is where the story of Cadwallader Colden Corse began. Cadwallader was married to Thorne's daughter, Anna. They lived in the castle just shortly after the death of Thorne. One evening the neighborhood was privy to two ambulances carrying Cadwallader away from the home.

Seems that Cadwallader was shot in the head by a rifle, survived, and to this day, no one really knows the reality of what happened. It is attributed to him that a spirit walks from that bathroom into the grand fireplace room. No one knows for sure, but speculation states, it was an attempted suicide on his part.

We continued throughout the rest of the castle. Hearing tales of books moving, foot steps, distant disembodied voices and smells. We viewed each room, learned the history of who stayed, lived and loved in each. We came upon the bridal suite, used by brides getting married at the castle. We heard a fascinating story of a residual haunting in this room.

On that one day in a woman's life where she feels like a queen, how suiting to be married in a castle. In the Bridal Suite room, once the betrothed is dressed, adorned and ready, while peering in to the full length mirror, common reports of a woman in period clothing appears behind the bride to be. When the startled bride turns around, the apparition disappears.

We continue throughout the castle, ending on the third floor. This is where my husband and I spent the evening, in the ""Rose Red"" suite, beautifully located on the third floor. The Rose Red was a beautiful combination of antique and red décor. Down the hall from us was our exquisite bathroom, with a large soaker claw foot tub, delectably scented soaps, and little bits of heaven in terry cloth. Further down the hall was originally built as servant's quarters.

Another common haunting complaint was that of servant's moving about in their quarters, when there has not been servants employed for many years. This is where our first abnormal event takes place.

Before we get to our amazing event, we take a walk out to the secret gardens, and meander around the grounds. While we were out with the small intimated crowd, we heard Deanna disclose that she has never felt a negative vibe from the castle, only positive and protection. While she is talking about the castle being protected by angles, I take pictures around the garden statuary. My best ecto shot to date was from the Thornewood Castle. To us, and to Deanna the owner, it looks like an angel, with wide spread wings. Her head is bowed, her arms are folded in front of her, and she's amazing!

We finish with the gardens, and head to our guest rooms. We were the only guests staying on the third floor, two doors down from the servant's quarters. There were three other guests staying on the lower leveled floors, but with the vast sizing of this beautiful castle, we would not have been able to hear them scream, run or any other noise, let alone talk. With them being such a distance away, we would not have been able to hear their alarm clocks.

We finished putting equipment away and crawled into our comfortable bed; my ever so enthusiastic and adventurous husband was asleep before he hit the pillow. I lay away, taking in the air, the sounds around me and just mentally reviewing the evening's events. My event to end my evening happened like this.

I felt the air chill, equating it to the crisp Washington Autumn air, but realizing the windows were closed. I saw movement to the left of me, and watched as the sheer gauzy curtain covering the closet door billowed out as if a person were exiting the walk in. I watched a man, no older than early 30s, slacks, white shirt unbuttoned at the sleeve and hanging loose, but tucked into his slacks, and covered with a black vest, also buttoned, walk around the foot of the bed. He looked pale, like the high autumn moon illuminate him perfectly creating an ethereal hue. He was of a tall and thin built stature, with dark clean and close cut hair, that came to subtle sideburns around his chin and ears. He continued to walk around the bed, not aware of my presence, come to my side of the bed, sit in the chair next to me, turn and look directly at me, only to vanish slowly like something out of a Scooby Doo cartoon.

Is the Thornewood Haunted, you may ask? Well for this one time novice and green spectral detective, it definitely was that night.

Spider Web Cottage,United Kingdom,Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: Spider Web Cottage

G eorge finally found a place to live; a rented place of his own, and a place with the one luxury he'd not seen for the previous twelve months, his own bathroom! Spider Web cottage was tiny, so small in fact, there was a danger of falling down the circular staircase should the sleeping occupant venture too far to the edge of the double bed which, after much maneuvering, had been squeezed onto an undersized mezzanine floor.

It was home however, and a place to gain the much desired privacy so lacking in shared accommodation, especially for a teacher getting on in years.

The cottage sat alongside a small courtyard which nestled behind a row of shops fronting the village high street. Parts of the structure were listed, and according to accounts dated back to the 13th century. It was unclear who or what occupied the original building, but rumours ranged from it once being a farrier's shed to that of a storage room for the illegal manufacture of unauthorized liquor.

None of this was of concern to George as it was home and, he could come and go as he pleased. More importantly, he now had the luxury of lingering for as long as needed in a hot bath, the old cast iron tub gracing the floor of what was probably the most spacious room in the cottage, the bathroom.

The other room, the lounge, carried a small refrigerator and a stove with dodgy heat controls. An unsteady chair and small table, the only other creature comforts, took up the rest of the limited space.

Closer examination of the accommodation gave George some ideas and, after a little thought, the double bed found itself downstairs in what was the lounge, with the solitary chair and table elevated to the mezzanine floor, companions to the newly purchased stereo system. Any chance of falling out of bed and down the metal stairs now eliminated.

He was soon to find out why the tiny cottage was so aptly named Spider Web Cottage. Each morning required the delicate task of removing a host of spiders from the bathtub. A glass and piece of hard card acted as rescue materials as he deftly cupped each spider, slid the card under the glass and deposited the bewildered creature in a flower urn outside the front door. How they managed to return each night remained a mystery as a thorough investigation of the small window and adjoining walls betrayed no gaps or cracks.

It wasn't long before George befriended a local pub and would spend pleasant weekend evenings in the company of locals.

On one such Friday evening, after consuming a little more than usual of his favourite brew, George ambled home with the welcoming thought of sleeping late into Saturday morning.

Bed felt warm and welcoming as he stared through the window at twinkling stars. 'There is a definite chance of a crisp, frosty morning,' he thought as he drifted into a peaceful sleep.

A silver glow painted a single beam of light across George's bed. The moon was up and on such a clear night the outside world shone with crystal brilliance.

At first he was baffled at his sudden awakening, nothing, neither inside or out stirring to warrant the sudden disturbance. The world was at peace!

He was about to roll over and attempt to recall a rather erotic dream when the bathroom door creaked.

""Probably my imagination and the remnants of the earlier liquid intake,"" he pondered.

Turning over he fell back under the warmth of the duvet. The door creaked again, this time with a slow prolonged squeak.

George watched, the door now visibly moving back and forth in slow rhythmic swings, the movement reminiscent of a child experiencing its first encounter with a new toy. This was creepy, very creepy. He doubled checked the outside, just in case a breeze now disturbed the world; nothing!

The door stopped moving, he waited; perhaps a physical investigation a good idea, but remaining in bed definitely a safer option.

At first it sounded like a gentle breeze, a whisper, as one might hear when resting in a forest or along a river bank. The breeze increased in tempo, rising to the sound of a strong wind whipping round the corners of a house and then, as George pulled the duvet closer, his eyes white in disbelief and fear, the wind struck gale force, howling and whining round and through the small cottage with a ferocity that could take the whole building with it.

He dared a glance outside, but the world remained peaceful. His eyes were back searching, but for what? Nothing inside the cottage moved, it was just frightening sound, only a terrifying roar echoing its deafening intentions. Nothing in the cottage moved!

""What, who, the bloody hell are you!"" George yelled above the roar.

It suddenly stopped, as if responding to his call, and once again the room fell silent, except for one thing, the door, that bloody door, swinging once again. This time however, it eased noisily wider until it stood fully open.

He wasn't to be disappointed! At first he thought it was a dog, a large black one without ears.

As the animal, thing came closer, he saw it wasn't a dog, in fact it wasn't like anything he'd ever seen. The thing, creature, object, he was lost for description, looked like a very large egg and stood about three feet high. It moved towards the bed without visible signs of locomotion and reminded him of a wobbly lump often animated on children's cartoons. This lump was less attractive, greyish blue best describing its colour.

A sudden change took place, George felt at peace, the fear replaced with an unusual calmness and sense of well being. He felt himself pulled towards the thing and allowed his head to move closer. Did it want him to touch it? He was never to find out, as the gales and roar arrived once again, and, as if taking its leave in the noise, the thing disappeared. With its disappearance, so went the howling sounds, disappearing into the night as the passing train might whistle a fading tune.

He was alone again. The night outside remained the same, ice crystals forming as dawn grew near. The door, the door to the bathroom, it remained open.

The next Friday George related his story to the interested patrons. They laughed, taking the opportunity to blame the extra alcohol he'd had that evening.

They all turned to eye an elderly gentleman tucked in a corner. He nestled a whisky in two wrinkled hands.

""The child, that boy who disappeared in the early twenty's, some said he was murdered and buried under the cottage...""

This was too much for Graham. ""You don't believe in that rubbish, do you?""

""Let me tell you George, you were used to release the child to the next world..."" Alfred took a sip. ""That blob you saw, that was energy!""

""What crap, energy, George was hallucinating! Drank too much..."" Peter was back.

""Tell me George, how did you feel when the energy passed on? I mean did you feel good or bad?""

""Quite relaxed, strange really-I actually felt good. Yes good, really good...""

""I rest my case..."" The old man grinned, ""You did a service George, they were waiting for you...""

""Who in F's name are they!"" Graham was getting angry. He gulped the remnants of a lager down and slammed the glass on the table. ""Fill er up love, I think I need an escape from this bunch of weirdoes...""

""There will be more George. I can feel it's not over yet..."" Alfred stuck a glass on the table.

""It's my round..."" George was already searching for the money. This was getting interesting.

PS: To respect my privacy, it was written in the third person.

Whispers In The Dark,Canada,Apparitions / Voices / Touches,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Apparitions / Voices / Touches :: Whispers In The Dark

A bout two weeks ago, my sister and I were watching television. The lights went out due to a thunder storm that had been going for about a half hour. Par for the course, I dug out some candles and my copy of Risk. About 15 minutes through the game, my sister started acting weird, cocking her head and glancing around, as if she was hearing things. She asked me if ""You hear that...?"" I said no; what was she talking about?

She said she was hearing whispers, funny wind noises, and clothes moving.And then, she shuddered and screamed, very, very loudly, stood up, and ran into the bathroom.

I went to the bathroom to try and console her, but I didn't feel right, and went to the sink in the kitchen adjacent to the bathroom and living room and threw up.

I also heard my sister vomiting as well, and then the lights turned back on. We stayed in the kitchen, lights on and we stayed there until my dad came back from the work, and I told him I think we got food poisoning from the steak we ate earlier.

I talked to my sister about this the next day, and she said she couldn't understand what the voices were saying.

Around noon today (two weeks later), she said she heard the noises again, but nothings happened yet, luckily.

I'm still convinced there's a logical explanation, so if anyone can think of one, please tell me.

The Lady Beside My Bed,"North Dakota, United States",Apparitions / Voices / Touches,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Apparitions / Voices / Touches :: The Lady Beside My Bed

A bout five or six years back I woke up to a terrible nightmare where I was running from a lady that was calling my name as I ran I fell into a pit to hell. Right when I fell into the flames of hell I awoke in fear, still hearing my name. I checked around my house but find nothing strange, as I walked back to my room it stopped. I lie back down and fall asleep and as I have the same dream I notice some about the laid a faint recognition and sorrow in her eyes and my running from her went on for quite some time and then I awoke from the dream.

Now fear is spreading through my body I could barely move and as I slowly started to get my movement back she started calling my name again witch still would strike fear in my body. I managed to get out of that room and look around my house as a slowly walked from room to room.

I felt sadder and sadder but I finally reached the last room in my house but I still came up with nothing until... I returned to my room to get a good sleep even though the calling of my name continued so I slowly walked to my room nervous of what I mite see and rite when I get to the stairs into my room a lady with long brown hair no legs and a white robe is lifting the covers up to my bed and when she discovered I was not there she turned around...

Fear had taken over my body now and I couldn't move as the sad lady walked toward me. I finally kicked into action and ran to sleep in my parent's room.

The next morning I told my parents my story they said I was dreaming but I knew in my heart what I said had happened. I told my two sisters and the my brother the same story my sister didn't believe me but my brother who is a strong believer in ghosts believed me.

That was the last I saw or herd of that ghosts it may be the last but who knows...

Thanks for reading my first story more to come up soon and some time ill have to go out after dark like 3 A.M. When it's dead time and try and get a couple E.V.P's

Night Fright,British Indian Ocean Territory,Apparitions / Voices / Touches,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Apparitions / Voices / Touches :: Night Fright

W hen I was really young, I was sitting up in bed when I heard bumping and knocking in the walls. I was coming from upstairs to downstairs. My room was below the kitchen. I got frightened as little kids do and I lay down in bed with the covers pulled over my head. Nothing really strange happened for the first five minutes so I pulled my head from under the covers and then I heard the banging right in front of my door. Almost straight after that I heard a rapping sound just above my head. I closed my eyes and put my head on my pillows. About thirty seconds later it felt like someone put both there hands on either side of my pillows and pushed down on them heavily, and it had really cold breath that smelt of tobacco. I was five or six when this happened so nobody believed me.

About a month ago my parents were having an argument and when I went into the living room where they were arguing it was really cold and I felt really angry for no reason. As soon as my parents left I saw a black shadow in the middle of the living room.  It stood at about seven foot tall and stank of stale smoke, and I heard a faint humming sound like a washing machine. Nothing has ever happened since.

The Wierd Black Shadow,Bangladesh,Apparitions / Voices / Touches,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Apparitions / Voices / Touches :: The Wierd Black Shadow

T his is a story told to me by one of my teachers. We will call him Mr.Shahin. This story took place in Bangladesh, his home country, when he was about 8 years old. He is now     26 years old. This is definitely a true story because while saying this it still gives him shivers!

Shahin was 8 years old at that time. He had some eye infection in his right eye. Shahin was always in bed and his mom used to put medicine in his eye every night. One night, Shahin didn't want to have the medicine put in as it was very painful. He turned on his television and pretended to go to sleep, his mother didn't like him watching television. He locked the door and kept the key with him. He kept all the lights on and pretended to go to sleep until his mother went to sleep.

He had his back to the door when he heard the creaking of the door. He thought his mother had come to give him medicine. He heard the footsteps coming nearer and when they reached the bed, Shahin said that he didn't want to have the medicine put in his eye. The ""thing"" sat down on his bed. He knew this because he felt the side of his bed going down. Then, all of a sudden, he realized that he had locked the door and the key was with him so how could anyone open the door?

He slowly lifted his covers and he saw that everything was dark. (He had put all the lights on before sleeping). When he looked up, he saw a very dark, black shadow looking down at him. The shape was not describable. He was so scared! Shahin tried to scream but no voice was coming from his mouth. After about 5 minutes, the shadow left and all the lights came on as well as the television.

He got up as fast as he could and ran to his mom, who was in the kitchen. He asked her   whether the lights had gone out but she said no. He then told his mother the full story but, as most parents, his mother didn't believe him.

Can anyone tell me what that ""black shadow"" was? I was really confused while hearing this story. Does anyone have any explanations? Thanks for reading, all!

My Time In France,France,Apparitions / Voices / Touches,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Apparitions / Voices / Touches :: My Time In France

I would like to apologize for my English - I'm not a native speaker. All the lines below are true as I saw that two months ago.

I'm a university student and in January I left my home for France , in order to improve my French. I chose a small town in the middle of the country . I stayed with a single parent family which consisted of a father and his two teenage daughters. We lived in a 18th century flat. During my first week I had nightmares , full of weird animals and devil monsters. I also was incredibly unlucky. I did not pay much attention to that because everything was so new for me there. As time went on I used to see a man sitting on a sofa watching me. I also had the feeling of being watched, but I think that it is pretty common. I did not pay much attention to that. It could be my mind and shade and lights what could trick me.

All changed one Wednesday afternoon. I came back home from shopping, I unlocked the heavy old wooden door and I heard some man loudly talking right from the place, where the sofa is. I became very nervous, not being scared because I was just like: Oh, my friend has a guest here and I'm supposed to speak my terrible French. But than I realize that no one should be at home this time. I quietly left the flat and started to look for my mobile phone. Then again I realized that there was total silence. So I opened the door again and really - no one was in. Since then it got worse and worse.

Each and every night I woke up between 2:30 and 4:00, mostly at 3:15 - the time I was born. I heard loud knocking coming from one wall and I felt someone standing in the door space beside my bed. As days passed away the knocking was more frequent and scratching was also heard. I always had to switch on the lights and never fall asleep again. I also found my bedroom door open. First week I blamed the children , that they making a fool of me. But even when I was alone all these strange things happened. I became very nervous and start going to the church everyday. I ask Catholic community for advice, but I was only recommend to leave the place once and for all. But I couldn't do that because I had a contract to stay there and take care of the kids in exchange for being given food and living.

The turning point was one Sunday, when my friend was ill in his bed in the room next to the mine. I was doing some work on my PC, while I found myself being bitten by small but human teeth. This happened three times. I became a nervous wreck. My mind was like in storm. I contacted an invader from my home who told me to say a prayer and not to be scared. So I prayed every time I woke in night and before I went to bed. I also slept with a small sainted figure of an angel that my mother gave me before I flew away. It worked a bit. Maybe for a week I thought all would be okay. I was wrong.

Even when I wasn't alone I started feeling someone behind me, the chime decoration was quickly swinging in the air when I looked at it. I also sometimes felt being almost freeze that I had problem to take a breath. Often during the day lamps in different rooms were switched on. All these things were happening for nine weeks. I decided to leave France about 12 weeks earlier. I have to say that the family father sometimes woke up in the same time like me, but heard nothing. Also the children didn't like me much and didn't talk to me at all. I suffer from panic fear from dark. I'm a Catholic and I have experience with seeing some things that I don't understand, I also have prophetic dreams. But my time in France really changed my life.

Spider Web Cottage 2,United Kingdom,Apparitions / Voices / Touches,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Apparitions / Voices / Touches :: Spider Web Cottage 2

T hings settled after the blob experience and I soon forgot the incident, daily requirements to earn a living taking precedent. The bath spiders still came, and with my assistance, went. Down at the Livingstone pub however, old Alfred remained a persistent and often annoying reminder. Each time I ventured through the door, he was there, sipping his precious whisky and eyeing me above a pair of misshapen, dirty glasses.

It was always the same question, followed by the same negative response, a shake of my head. Somehow, I never got the feeling he believed me and the ritual was very annoying to say the least. I felt tempted to tell him to shut up, but somewhere in my upbringing I'd been taught to respect the elderly and managed to refrain from an untoward response.

One Friday evening, while leaving the cottage on my way to the pub, I had thoughts of old Alfred waiting to pounce. My own company seemed a better option? Yes, I would buy a few cans, settle into the chair upstairs and enjoy a classical radio station. Perhaps I might even tackle the book I'd been threatening to read.

I was quietly enjoying a cool lager when the phone interrupted Tchaikovsky's Emperor Piano Concerto.

""Come home to mama, all is forgiven. There might be a little extra if you hurry! Come home to your darling Wendy..."" A giggle followed.

""Don't play games Gary, I'd know that accent anywhere, get home now or you'll regret it!"" Her tone had changed.

This conversation wasn't going anywhere; I slammed the phone down.I was about to turn the volume back up when, you guessed it, the phone rang.

""Look Gary, I know it's you and this is my final warning. Get your backside down here or you'll be sorry!""

Feeling understandably confused I eased back into my chair and took another sip. ""Damned Cheeky,"" I thought. ""The woman must be drunk...""

Tchaikovsky eased me back into the book. It was difficult however, the call dogging my thoughts and limiting any chance to concentrate on the subject matter. I glanced at the table clock; nine thirty! The pub would still be open and I needed some company anyway, especially after listening to that stupid woman.

Alfred was in his usual corner. I gave him the customary shake of the head.

""You're late tonight darling!"" The bar attendant grinned through a perfect set of false teeth.

""I wasn't going to come tonight Jenny, but I had some stupid woman on the phone calling me Gary, refusing to accept she had the wrong number and, threatening me with all kinds of you know what if I didn't return...""

""Someone's got your number darling; what have you been up to?"" Jenny sang the words while a painted nail scraped the day's stubble under my chin.

""She called you Gary?"" Alfred pushed unceremoniously through the crowd.

I sighed, Alfred the last person I felt like having a conversation with; I nodded.

""Give him a break Alfred; the man just wants some peace..."" Jenny planted a pint on the counter.

""What was her name, the woman's name on the phone. Did she give you her name?"" He ignored Jenny's plea.

Even in the dull glow of the pub I could see his face change, an alcohol red draining to a pail pink. He shifted away and pushing through the crowd, wobbled back to the corner.

""Did I say something wrong?"" I looked at Jenny, uncomfortable with Alfred's reaction.

""Wendy was his daughter's name, Gary his son in law's name...""

""Happened about five, six years ago; we don't talk about it as these things are best forgotten, shame poor man...""

""No not at the cottage, I'm not sure where, but I do know she was murdered...""

I pushed my way over to old Alfred. ""I'm so sorry, I didn't know. I'm sure it's pure coincidence, the names I mean. Please accept my apology for being so rude over the past few weeks...""

He nodded, ""She loved music, beautiful lass, loved life, a loss to the world, such a terrible waste..."" Two clear blue eyes visibly filled with moisture.

""It's time I went home thank you. You know, if only I..."" He stopped and changed the thread, ""I suppose I read too much into your ghosts, more out of hope and a wish we would meet again, than real belief. Then, when I heard the names...""

""But why my cottage Alfred, there doesn't seem to be any connection?"" I wanted more.

""They had a row and Gary stayed there the night my Wendy was murdered. I was a painter and decorator in those days and as it was empty had keys to the cottage. Gary didn't want to stay with me. I think he had a little bit waiting on the side, no proof mind you, and as there was an old bed well...""

The desire to press for more was almost overwhelming, but it was none of my business and I let discretion get the better of me.

""Radio Five, she loved Radio Five..."" Alfred smiled, recalling some pleasant interlude in the distant past. He waved a hand, ""Don't mind me, ramblings of an old man...""

We never saw him again. Some said he'd passed away while others suggested he'd moved to another county.

I was sorry I'd gone to the pub, and fell into the solitary chair feeling lonely and depressed. It had not been a good evening! The low tones of Beethoven's Ninth did nothing to lift my depressed mood and I switched off, deciding the only place worth being, was in bed. Just as was about to turn off the light, a thought occurred to me. Of course, the last caller's number would be recorded. I rushed up the metal circular stairs, grabbed the nearest available paper, which happened to be a credit card statement, rummaged for a pen, and dialled.

""Telephone number..."" At least it wasn't a blocked call, I scribbled, ""...555 370 called... On the 5th...""

If ever I had a strange feeling, it was in that moment. Perhaps the previous event, the arrival and disappearance of the 'blob', could be explained away as a nightmare, but this was no nightmare. The phone did ring, a woman did speak to me and yet, there was no record of her call, for that matter no record of any calls that day. Even more unnerving was the coincidence of her name being the same as old Alfred's daughter and, to make matters even more confusing insisting my name was Gary.

An awful din had me springing out of bed! It was the Rolling Stones thrashing out 'Angie' from the upstairs floor. I half staggered, half fell up the damned metal stairs, cutting a toe in the process. Swearing and cursing I reached for the stereo on/off switch.

I pressed another channel, Radio 5, and another, Radio 5; all pre-select stations read Radio 5!

There was to be one further incident before Spider Web cottage and I parted company. Not nearly as dramatic as those already recorded, but I am sure, sufficiently uncanny to warrant a mention

Unforgettable Experience,Philippines,Non Human Entities,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Non Human Entities :: Unforgettable Experience

I was only 15 years old when we moved to this old fashion house in the province, everyone was very hospitable and happy. I was wondering about how they can live so simple when everything could be more exciting. I became interested in their lifestyle and started talking and asking about anything that comes out of my mind. Until my uncle started telling me something like ""You should always be careful and aware of your surroundings because this is a new place for you and you are a new face for everyone in this town..."" I don't get what he meant... But I just agreed and moved on.

One night as I was about to sleep I heard a weird noise. It sounded like a big cat scratching the wall of the room, with long sharp claws. I was so pissed that I can't sleep because of that, I slammed a book into the wall and made a big noise that disturbed my sister. But the noise stopped so it's better. My room is located beside big trees, when you look out of the window you'll see a farm and feel fresh air, so I thought it's just one of those animals who likes to fool around at night with those weird noises.

In the morning I told my parents about it but they didn't care much. The next night the scratching started again, my little sister was scared because now it constantly changed places but would did not stop even when I again slammed a book to where the sound was coming.

By the way the house was made of thick old wood, everything can be heard from the ground up to the 2ndfloor ,especially when someone is wearing high heels, you know what I mean?. It is an antique house that has big windows where 2 people can jump out of it when it's open and hard wood doors. Some part of the house needs to be fixed and walls need to be change before it collapses. My parent's room is in the other side so probably they cannot hear anything so much because of the toilet and another room between us.

The weird sound continues and it seems like whatever the purpose of the scratching I felt IT can actually make a hole, the idea made me nervous so we went to our parent's room and woke them up. Dad checked every corner of the room and assumed that it might be a big rat or something and the noise already stopped before he could actually hear it so he did not pay more attention to it, we stayed the night to our parent's room for 4 nights in a row.

Then the day where my parents visited an old friend from a different town so I invited my 2 friends to sleep over with my younger sister and I to keep us company and fool around. I told them the story about the scratching and they were excited to hear that and planned to catch the so called cat or rat that night. At around 10pm we started preparing to call it a night after watching 3 movies and gossiping. They remembered the plan and started getting some sort of weapons like knife, baseball bat and ice pick, I chose the baseball bat for it is just for scaring the creature I don't like killing any animal for that matter. So we placed the ""weapons"" beside us. My little sister was not so excited about it so she went to sleep and didn't want to have anything to do with the idea.

We were getting sleepy when the noise started. I whispered to my friends ""do you here that? It's IT!"" they are both quiet trying to figure out what kind of animal is making that weird noise. ""It's not a Cat or Rat..."" this time it's making the scratching deeper. I woke up my sister and asked her to move because I'm going to throw big books on that side where she was sleeping because that's where IT was. I got all 3 big encyclopedia books and BAM slammed tem at that side of the wall. I was shocked by the noise it made but more petrified by what we found out, IT was so shocked by the slamming; we heard it spread a sort of wings and fly.

My friend said ""this is not good... what kind of bird would do this? As I remember Birds stay where they cannot be invaded but why this one comes back every night? You know what? I don't think this is an animal"". My friend went to the kitchen and got us salt and garlic. He said it can be helpful.

We slept and got disturbed again by the scratching I checked the time its 3am and wake everyone up ""It is here again!"" my little sister was sleeping beside me I don't want to wake her up so I just carry her and move her to a sofa bed near the closed door and window. My friend starts cursing the creature telling IT that we are not afraid, if IT will be able to come inside the house we will not stop until he bleeds to death (that's a strategy to send a message that we are not afraid) but honestly I don't understand what it is but I'm too afraid to open any window to check because we are trying to stay safe inside the house until morning and besides the windows are too big.

We continue making noises and swearing to IT and then it stopped for while and I thought it's finished just like the same old nights, but to my horror he started scratching the window next to my sister and it's like IT wants to fold the window with it's bare hands and claws. I was too terrified to see if the window is actually moving and forced to be open from the outside. I hit the window again and again and didn't know what else to do.

My sister now started crying and she said she had a nightmare that an old lady with very ugly makeup was pulling her out of that window with her big hand and long nails. That's when my friends and I was convinced that this is not an ordinary bird or cat or rat... I got the phone, called my parents and asked them to come home immediately... NOW! I didn't have the courage to tell them the details yet so I just hang up the phone.

All of us did not sleep. We sat all together at the far corner where we can breathe. IT was still there scratching trying to get near my sister but we put the salt and garlic around her I don't know why but I guess it helps a little because IT don't know where to scratch anymore. When our parents arrived we are all exhausted, we tried to convince them about IT but of course for them its nonsense. My Uncle checked my room and asked me all about it; he checked the walls inside, nothing. He went and out got a ladder and checked the walls outside, BINGO! There are the marks of the scratching, very deep scratching, and looks like a mark of an angry tiger or beast. Then my parents were convinced. My uncle reminded me to be careful because this world is not just for us. Something could find us very interesting and would like to test if we are useful or not. I think now I understand what he's trying to say...

I don't expect everyone to believe... Because I know this is very impossible.

What's On TV?,New Zealand,Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: What's On TV?

A t about the age of 10, I moved from one haunted house to another haunted house. This story takes place in the second one. A little background on the house first: The house was once a hotel at which people would travel to by rail, then stay at before a horse and cart would take them out to the Waitomo Caves. However, as travel became more functional, it became more unnecessary, and so was split up. The portion I lived in (approx 2/3 of the original structure) was moved about 2km down the road, and both were converted into houses.

The house that I spent my formative years in was haunted by multiple entities. Some friendly, some merely shadows, and others who made me or my family uncomfortable. This particular one was more, I guess, curious than anything else.

The Lounge and living area was a large room, with the fireplace and television at one end, and the dining area at the other. We had the area divided by putting a couch and chair in about the middle of the room.

One evening, I was watching the TV alone (the rest of the family being out, or in the case of my father, working on something in the shed) when I felt my father come in and pause behind the chair to see what I was watching, as was his custom. ""Yeah, nothing's on"" I told him as I flicked through the channels for him. He didn't respond, and so I turned around. I blushed to myself when I realized I'd been talking to thin air.

A few years later, when my siblings and I had moved out, I came home for a weekend, just to spend time with my parents and the four-legged members of the family. I was watching TV once more as I felt my father do his usual step up and pause to see what was on. I made a comment about how I was watching the only thing worth seeing, and turned to see what he was up to. Again, there was no-one there.

The second time it happened though, I wasn't at all surprised to see no-one there. In fact, I was mildly amused by it. It's a pleasant thing to know there's a benign ghost who stops by for a quick ""what're you watching?""

More recently (late 2007, at an approximation) I was down visiting my parents (and pets) again. Eventually, both of them had retired to bed and left me to my devices. Again, I felt someone step up behind me, as though to see what was on. I didn't even turn around. Just said ""Hi"", smiled, and kept on watching.

The Thing In The Closet,"Michigan, United States",Pets / Animals,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Pets / Animals :: The Thing In The Closet

I honestly don't think that my house is haunted. I don't hear unexplained noises or see apparitions or feel the slightest bit uncomfortable anywhere in the house- even our newly finished basement. Apparently Lily does.

After Suzy died suddenly in the backyard (while I was at school, of all places), my parents bought me a new little black and brown yorkie that I named Lily Sue- Sue after Suzy. She weighs about five pounds, and can fit cupped in both palms. She even has a small white tuft of hair on her belly. Though she loves to be the ""hot shot"" and attempt to scare much older, bigger dogs, she really is just a sweet (tiny) harmless little pup. Not the least bit intimidating, if you ask me. However, she has recently taken up barking at (what appears to me) absolutely nothing, followed by a fit of whimpering and one Lily scurrying out of the room.

At first I thought nothing of this. For one, I thought I was sensitive to things lurking around in houses, and I never feel a thing here. But this became harder to ignore when one day things started to get a little out of hand.

I had just let Lily in from outside when she walked to the edge of the landing, facing the basement, and just stared. At first I thought she had spotted a pair of underwear or a sock (she loves to dig these items out of the laundry basket and treat them as toys), but I saw nothing of the sort laying around and we had just done the laundry- the clothes basket was empty. However, Lily spotted something and began to growl, eventually becoming somewhat vicious (or as mean as a little Yorkshire terrier can get), and I decided that the best thing to do was to grab her and go upstairs.

About twenty minutes later, while chewing on a toy and enjoying a little nap on my bed, Lily looks up suddenly and fixes her eyes on my closet. Much barking ensues. I thought that maybe there was a string dangling from a shirt or that a dust bunny emerged or something, but a good assessment of my closet confirmed that nothing of any interest to Lily was there. I looked at her when I was finished and she seemed uneasy that I was in it, a bit scared, and even sad. She didn't have anymore fits for the rest of the day. But sure enough, as I was getting ready for bed, Lily spots something in my closet once again and decides to bark, growl, and jump up and down on my bed. I did yet another inspection, found nothing, and told her to chill. She did this, but she still had her eyes fixed on the closet, occasionally whimpering, occasionally looking at me, occasionally pawing at the bed as if to say ""I want out of here!"" and when my dad finally came home from work, she gladly went to his room to sleep for the night.

At one point, I did start to feel uneasy, but really only because Lily kept barking at something I couldn't see. I started to remember a time when Suzy did something similar- I was straightening my hair before school in front of my mirror. Suzy was on my bed, and then she sat up fast and began growling at the wall behind my desk. She hopped off the bed but refused to walk near that wall, and whimpered at me when she realized all other escape routes were blocked. But unlike Suzy, this was not a one time thing. Lily had already freaked out twice and I had no solution.

I went to my dad's room and scooped up Lily Sue. When she noticed I was taking her to my room she started to squirm, but a nice rubbing of the belly was all she needed and she was out- until 3:00 a.m. When she proceeded to jump out of my arms in a barking fit at an invisible something in my closet. That was it for me. I, too, jumped out of my bed, yelled something, grabbed the dog, and ran out of there. I told my mom that something was in my closet and began to climb into her bed when she kindly informed me that Lily wasn't welcome. I set her on the ground, but my mom fearing she would ruin something in the house told me to go find her and put her in my room. I picked her up and put her on her own bed, then put myself to bed as well. About five minutes later, I heard the soft padding of paws on the tile floor, and the ringing of a dog's collar and rabies tag. I assumed this was Lily, but was surprised at how few steps I heard. They just seemed to stop at the rug. I figured she had plopped her butt down and I simply hadn't heard, and passing that off as a logical solution.

I tried to doze off, but my mom sat up and asked me where Lily was. I told her she was sleeping on the rug, but my mom said that Lily was nowhere to be seen. Rather annoyed, I stepped out in the hall, and noticed that Lily was laying in her bed in my room looking at me rather wearily. I grabbed her and her bed and set them both on my mom's rug, but Lily was not up for that. She took one look at that rug, and bolted into the hall, where she just sort of sat pathetically.

I really didn't understand what was going on, but she was pretty firm in her decision to stay off the rug, so I threw her back on my dad's bed. She stayed there for the rest of the night and I finally got some sleep.

Dream Of Terror,"Georgia, United States",Demons / Possessions / Exorcisms,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Demons / Possessions / Exorcisms :: Dream Of Terror

M y best friend had a dream, in which I was in. The way she told it terrified me, because she said it was so vivid it might have been real. I might also admit that I was at her house when this happened, in case that makes a difference to the readers.

She told me that late at night she 'dreamed' that she was walking around her dark house and she looked around and I was next to her. She looked forward again and we just sort of walked around some more.

Then she told me that she looked around again at me and something happened. My appearance was changing into something evil. She said that my hair was turning grey and frizzy, my teeth turned yellow and my face turned a white/grey color, and finally, my eyes rolled back and turned completely black.

She woke up screaming, which woke me up, and she told me the dream when she made sure I wasn't still demented. I told her it was just a dream, but the thing that made me think it was more was that the door to her bedroom was open. My friend only sleeps with the door closed...

That little fact scared me half to death. Could it mean that I'm evil and something happened? Or was it just a stupid dream that means nothing?

Thank you for reading this story, even if you think it was nothing and I'm crazy for getting scared.

Shadow Man in the Bushes,"Georgia, United States",Apparitions / Voices / Touches,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Apparitions / Voices / Touches :: Shadow Man in the Bushes

A couple years ago during early July, I was spending time with my best friend. We lived in a suburban neighborhood that was built over forestland. Some of the woods were kept in backyards for private land. My friend and I were going in to the woods because we had grown bored. We walked over to the backyard and, we started to walk up a hill. When we arrived at the top we were standing in front of some bushes about up to our waist. The woods were just right behind these bushes.

This was around noon and it was a hot day with no breezes at all. We started to walk past the bushes when they started rustling violently. This caused us to jump back nearly sending me tumbling down the hill. My friend was so scared that he began running back down the hill in sheer terror. I looked back at him and taunted him for being scared. I told him that it could have been a squirrel or something of that nature. I mean rustling bushes right what else it could be? Especially during the day I wasn't expecting anything else for sure. After I told him that he was still standing there for about 2 seconds and ran home. I laughed a little inside.

I turned around back to the bushes. I saw it only for a split second. It was taller than I was at the time. It looked pitch black but it was staring me right in the face. It looked like a man's shadow. I knew it wasn't mine because I had been frozen up with fear. It then ran away to my left before it disappeared right before my eyes. I started feeling a cold sensation and began running down to my friend's house and told him everything.

I ask you all. What was that thing I saw? I never saw it again but I never can forget that moment. If anyone can shed some light I would be thankful.

Strange Happenings in Thailand,Thailand,Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: Strange Happenings in Thailand

T his is my first story share of my experiences and definitely not my last, I can start off first that my mother is from Thailand and my father is from Harlem, NYC. So my mom always told me her beliefs in the spirit world. My dad on the other hand always told me, that spirits can't hurt you physically.

I moved to Thailand with my family in 1994. We were transferred there for six years and since my mother was from there , my dad figured it would be nice to know that side of the family. I was in the 4th grade, in a new country and trying to adjust to our new home. My room was enormous and I had my own bathroom. My room was at the end of the hall, my younger brotherâ€™s room was in the middle of the hall and my parents were on the other end. I believe this was a month after we moved in. I was taking a bath. I  had carpet on my bathroom floor by the way. So when I was finally done, I put one foot out and BOOM! Something pushed me out the tub and I fell and caught myself on the counter. Now mind you, I had carpet on the floor so I know I didn't slip out the tub. I felt some type of force push me out! I ran naked to my parents room and told her what happened. That same night she called my grandmother (her mom) and my grandmother said we should have had the house blessed.

So that very weekend, it was a lot of monks that came if I can remember it was 8 or more. They came to bless the house .We had to pray and I was told to wear these 3 black and gold Buddha bracelets for 3 months. I still have them to this day. Afterwards everything seemed fine but little things every now and then would happen. For instance we had a housekeeper Khun Tong Phoon (her name) she had her room beside the kitchen but she always ended up in my room sleeping on the floor. She would tell my mom she would hear knockings on her walls, movement in her room when she was the only one in there. Now from what I was told Thailand has numerous names, The Land of the Smiles, The Land of the Dead or The Land of Spirits. Everyone in my building had a housekeeper, so what they did would get together and talk about different occurrences in my building and the other buildings that were housed with American families. Each building had what its called a spirit house and my mom would go downstairs every weekend and pay her respects.

Another incident happened when my dad was out of the country so my brother and I would sleep in my moms room with her. My mom was on her side, my brother was in the middle and I was on my dads side. I was awakened by some sort of talking going on in the late middle of the night, when I peeked my eyes open, there sitting at the foot of the bed on my side, was 2 little boys ghostly figures. I wasn't too scared because I seen they were little boys, but just in a white light appearance. They were sitting at the foot of the bed laughing and pointing at me saying "" Your a bad girl!"" , giggling and pointing at me. I shut my eyes so hard and I covered my ears so I couldn't hear them. I told my mom the next day and she laughed at me, not because she didn't believe me but she said those little boys were right, I was being a bad girl and I was.

But my last incident I will share for the moment happened in another building, I was with my younger brother who was seven years old at the time and I was nine. We were walking with our housekeeper (a new one because our first one left because she was too scared) on the top floor where the pool was at. My brother and I were walking by the pool,  the sides werenâ€™t wet at all because no one was in the pool .All of a sudden when I turned my back my housekeeper was screaming for me, I ran up and I seen her trying to pull my brother out the pool. He was a small skinny boy and she was struggling to pull him out ,so I grabbed his other arm and it took us five minutes to get him out the pool! He said something pulled him in , he held onto the drain, and  was yelling for us. Our housekeeper was explaining to my mother that something was still pulling him into the water. I vouched for her because it took us five minutes to yank him out! He was such a small boy and for two people pulling him out was unbelievable. A couple of weeks went by and when my mom came home, she pulled me aside and explained to me what was pulling my brother down.

She had talked to a couple of the people in the building where we were at, and apparently a young boy drowned there years ago. No one ever swims in that pool by themselves because it is said that the boy tries to pull you down with him. And that day it really caught us off guard ,even still my brother tells what happened every now and then .I'm 23 and he is 20 but he said he will never forget that day and how he almost lost his life because the boys spirit was pulling him down. And I to this day will never forget when I was pushed while I was coming out my bathtub. Weird Weird Weird & scary. I'm glad I'm back in the states!

Not saying it doesn't happen here, but I'm not in Thailand nor in our old apartment building.

The Drummer At The Dam,"Texas, United States",Apparitions / Voices / Touches,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Apparitions / Voices / Touches :: The Drummer At The Dam

I have always been fascinated by ghost stories and tales of the paranormal. I've always had an open mind about that kind of thing. Especially if I feel I am in a place that could potentially have some paranormal activity. When I had the experience I'm about to share with you, I was not prepared whatsoever.

It was three years ago and I was still living with my parents in Lakehills, Texas. I was 18 and had just recently met a guy named Jeremy that seemed pretty cool so I decided to take a drive out to Kerrville (about 40 miles away) and hang out with him for a day. After driving around town for awhile, he suggested that we should check out this old dam that wasn't far to hang out and talk.

We were driving in this small neighborhood that was surrounded by a wooded area and he instructed me to park on the side of the road in front of some trees. We climbed over a barbed wire fence and found a steep trail going down towards the dam. We eventually got to this clearing where we could see the creek and the dam.

It's a little difficult to explain how it was set up but I will try my best. There was a cement wall that went up the hill on the side where my car was parked. There was a cement slab that was connected to this that went from the corner of the dam and the trail and extended about 20 feet by 4 feet until it dropped off. The drop was about 15 feet to the rocky bottom and the edge of the creek below. The dam was perpendicular to this cement slab we were sitting on and extended about 100 yards to another cement wall at the other side of the creek. We were sitting on that small cement slab looking out over the creek that was still and shallow below the dam wall. The wall of the dam that faced the creek was slanted at a 45 degree angle. The creek was completely visible to the other side of the dam. There was a thick wooded area parallel to the dam with the creek in the middle. I really hope I'm not confusing (or boring) anyone with the description but this has important relevance to my story.

Basically, we were sitting on the small cement slab overlooking the creek below with the dam on our right side and the woods to our left.

It was late in the afternoon and the sun was going down over the horizon. We were chatting when we heard a faint sound of drums in the distance past the woods. It was slow but steady and we stopped talking to listen to it. Not knowing what to make of it, we started joking that maybe it was some hobos having a party in the woods. We really didn't think anything of it because it sounded so far away. The sky was starting to get really dark by this time. The drumming never stopped. It was getting louder and seemed to be coming closer to the part of the creek that was visible to us. We couldn't hear anything or anyone but the drumming. The sound of the drumming was rhythmic. It wasn't just a constant, loud thumping. It actually sounded pretty good besides the fact that it was starting to make me nervous. All of a sudden, the sound of the drumming seemed to come out from the woods and into the clearing of the creek. I just froze because I was starting to get really scared. The dusk made a small part of the creek visible with whatever light was left over from the day.

I was looking out on the water and I saw the shadow of a figure moving across the creek towards the dam. The drumming was getting louder and faster. It startled me and I pointed it out to Jeremy and told him what I saw. He was trying to play it cool and said he didn't see anything and told me not to worry. ""It must have been some old guy messing with us..."" I was still watching it move across the creek and then it started to move up the wall of the dam. It didn't just move, it glided up the wall. I was shocked that whoever was drumming moved up the wall with such ease and was still able to play the whole time. ""It"" was finally at the top of the dam. That's when it started coming towards us and getting even LOUDER and FASTER! Jeremy finally admitted that he could hear it getting closer and started to suggest that we leave. I was way ahead of him. I grabbed my stuff and started heading towards the corner of the cement slab, the beginning of the dam and the trail back up to my car.

It terrified me because I had to walk closer to whatever or whoever was coming towards us in order to leave. I thought about looking out towards ""the drummer"" to see if I could make out what or who it was. But I was way too scared and just wanted to get in my car and leave as soon as possible. I was trekking up the hill with Jeremy behind me and all of a sudden - the music stopped! This scared me more than I already was because I knew it must be following us up the trail by that point. We ran as fast as we could, climbed inside my car and got the hell out there!

That was the single most terrifying moment of my life. I barely said a word to Jeremy on the way back to his house. After I dropped him off, I took the long drive back to my house trying to figure out what that could have been. It's very possible it was someone trying to mess with us. I don't see how they could have known we were there because we weren't talking loudly and it was too dark for them to see us on that slab. I've been in other situations where people would scare me and my friends with some grand scheme. This didn't seem that at all. I mean, this was really going out of someone's way just to scare a couple of kids. The most startling thing about that whole experience was the fact that it moved up that wall so easily while playing the drums. It sounded like a small bongo drum that could be strapped around someone's body.

To this day, I still think about that night and try to come up with some logical explanation for what or who was out there with us. I still have no idea.

Demonic And Angelic Appearence,"California, United States",Misc,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Misc :: Demonic And Angelic Appearence

T his Story took place Saturday, 6 June, 2008. I was laying on a car in front of my house and passed out because I was sleepy so I went to sleep on a car. As I fell asleep I felt some one slide something down my left arm, but I just thought it was the wind and slept. 10 minutes later I woke up and saw a demon standing next to me on my left side and a bright light on my right. I had the strangest feeling that I had seen this Demon before and I believe it was my demon side coming out of my body. The demon was pretty interesting he had no eyes and a sharp bloody teeth and his body was covered in a really bad burn like if a body was lite on fire and kept on burning, also it had sharp fingers and it was smiling toward the light, interesting enough the bright light and the demon didn't fight. I believe what I saw that day was my demon side and my angel side talking. Surprisingly I didn't feel threatened my this demonic spirit, I just felt empty when I saw it and I believe that the demon I saw was my own demon and the angel was mine also. I hope to see the demon and angel again soon because I need to talk to them about stuff I had seen and I believe they have answers. Also after the event I fell back asleep and found myself in a place that was very bright but really hot, like if hell and heaven joined sides.

The Little Baby Girl,Philippines,Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: The Little Baby Girl

T his happened when I was 10 years old, when I had just moved into our new home. The house was pretty big and when I entered that house, I felt cold and I shivered. I made my way up to my new room to stay in and I finally found my bed.

That night I took a shower. As I was behind the covers of the shower curtain. I saw a shadow standing there. It was a figure of something small, maybe a baby even. I was terrified and I slowly opened the curtain. But nothing was there. Then when I went to bed, I heard a little baby crying and crying. I got up and followed the noise. But it was everywhere at once. But I didn't bother to find it again, so I just went to bed.

In the next day I decided to go around the neighbor and meet them. I went to every house. Then I went to one house, there was a nice little old lady about in her late 70's. We talked for a while, but then I asked her about the house. She told me a history of a mother and a little baby about 9 months old that used to live in that house, but they were both killed when the baby had accidentally stabbed her mother with scissors when her mother was asleep. But then the people had to kill the baby for punishment and shot the baby.

So now the baby is around the house looking for her mother, but her mother is never there. After hearing this I was deathly terrified and I wasn't sure if I wanted to live in that house anymore. So I told my mom the story. She didn't believe me at first but she then she did when she heard the crying too. We couldn't move somewhere else because we had just moved there. So I told my mom that I wanted to live with my dad and stay there until I decided to go home. Until this day I am living with my mom again She now has another house that we can live. I haven't been to that house again But I might another day.

Demonic Group Attacks,"California, United States",Demons / Possessions / Exorcisms,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Demons / Possessions / Exorcisms :: Demonic Group Attacks

T his event happened when I was about 11. I was sleeping in my upstairs bedroom. At the time I had a bunk bed and a fear of heights. I was terrified every night thinking I would fall. This particular event still confuses me but that night I felt as if some one was watching me. I ignored the feeling because I was always paranoid (the house was the same one as my first story Spirit Attack, and happened about 3 weeks later).

I was falling asleep and I could have sworn I had seen a group of four to six children running from one side of my room to the other. I awoke the next morning I was unable to lift any part of my body and I tried to move my head and I found a slash mark across my face (I have two fingernail scars on my face and one on my forehead).

My mother walked in 10 minutes prior to me waking up and she came in with a smile like always, then she had a look of fear on her face. I was having a seizure when she came in because of what I saw during the night. I felt some thing get on me and scratch my face and the others were holding me down so I could not fight back. I also felt some thing slide over my mouth. I woke the next night with a bloody mouth. I'm not sure what I experienced and I need some help.

Into The Unknown,"North Carolina, United States",Ghost Hunting,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Ghost Hunting :: Into The Unknown

I am a 25 year old girl who absolutely loves to do paranormal investigations. I have my own group. I call us G.A.P.S. This stands for Ghostly Appalachian Paranormal Society. I started this group February of 2007. Since then, we have experienced many different things from a dancing ghost to cold touches to eerie sounds, etc.

The first weekend of May of this year, myself and two other members were asked to 'ghost hunt' in a man's home. He has two young children in the home too. He told us a story of what happened to him, that as he was walking through the hallway to go into his son's room, a black shadow appeared in front of him and walked through him. He said he then became very weak and he sat down in the chair next to him. He told us that he could not hardly move for almost 10 minutes and when he stood up he became dizzy and lightheaded. He wanted us to investigate, to see if we could see or feel what he felt and saw.

I gather the equipment and head over to his home. He takes his children and goes camping so we could have the home to ourselves. The other two (a girl and a guy) and I go into the home, get a feel for the place, check all rooms for heat vents, ac units, mirrors, anything that could make us think something ghostly just made a sound, or something ghostly just reflected on the wall. We like to know of these things so we won't be fooled. We turn off the lights and I sit a camcorder facing the hallway where the shadow was seen and a voice recorder in the daughter's bedroom. I sit another voice recorder in the kitchen.  April (the other girl member) and I begin asking questions. ""Is there a presence in here that would like to show yourself?"" ""We want to communicate with you, so, you can speak freely into these recorders or if you'd let us take a picture of you, that would be great for our proof you are still here."" Then I would snap a photo. Other questions were asked and more pictures were taken. I went and got the camcorder and took it with me through the house. As we were standing in the dining area, the guy member (Rob) became sick to his stomach. He felt like he needed to get some fresh air, he went outside and stayed there until the investigation was over.

April and I are the only two in the home now. I am still holding the camcorder and am seeing white and green orbs pass by the lens. (The night vision was on.) They are weird orbs, not the normal dust passing by. They are dancing on the wall and then standing still in mid-air. I turn the camcorder to my right because I feel a cold spot on my right shoulder. There is a mist that I see in the camera over my shoulder but I can not see it with my own eyes. ""Alright! We are getting something!"" That's what I say and then I hear footsteps right next to me, to my left. April said, ""Did you hear that?"" More footsteps were heard and they sounded like they were walking circles around me and April. I tell her to take some pictures and I try to capture whatever was there on video, but, no luck. I then walk back through the hallway with the camcorder, go into the son's room and as I am walking out of the son's room, and into a spare bedroom, something popped up on the screen quickly that looked like a small white light. ""That's cool, hope it comes out in the review!"" I say this to myself as I go into the spare room, look around everywhere with the camcorder, in the closet, on the bed, etc. I then place the video recorder into the kitchen to record the hallway. April and I go into the daughter's bedroom and do some evp work with the voice recorder. The air has the feeling to it that someone is watching. We take more photos, do a little more evp work and decide to leave once that 'feeling' has subsided.

I review the evidence at my house within the next couple of days. On video, the white light from the spare bedroom shows up to be a face that pops out of the closet, looks directly into the camcorder and shoots back into the closet like it was scared it just got seen. It is amazing how clear it is. There are two wide eyes, a big shiny nose, a sad mouth and it looks to be a black aura around the face. We also have on voice recordings, ""April, it's April..."" ""C'mon..."" These recordings sound to be a small girl's voice. They are mainly whispers. There are breaths to that were captured. These voices and breaths were only at times when no one else was in the room... Funny thing is, they say April's name. We find out two days after the investigation that the home was built over 3 children graves.

I have contacted the tax office to try and find out things, but, I am having no luck. Can someone tell me how to find out information of a place and who lived there? It is very hard to do. Most people in this part of the world think I'm crazy and living on the dark side, but I am not crazy, and I am Christian. I believe these beings that show themselves are here to be known from the unknown. They need help, I'm sure.

Please leave comments and thanks for reading! Sorry it is sooooo long!:)

Spirit Boy,"Maine, United States",Apparitions / Voices / Touches,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Apparitions / Voices / Touches :: Spirit Boy

D ecember 16, 2007 was the day that my best friend's little brother died. He was 7 years old and died in a fire. Everybody was crushed, and after many months of pain we have all learned to live without him. I will call my best friend Sidney and our other best friend Carol, also calling Sidney's brother Jacob.

A month after the fire, Sidney was taking pictures of her house for whatever the reason. One of the areas where she took pictures was the closet. After the pictures were developed, we noticed some strange things in them.

The picture had strange apparitions in them. In the photo of the closet, (which her brother used to lay around in) actually showed him lying on the ground, just like old times! It made us all very sad, but happy that he was still here.

One day, Carol was home alone in her living room. Carol's relationship with Jacob was just as much as Sidney's. They loved each other like actual brother and sister and cared for each other very much. Whenever Carol visited Sidney, (which was pretty much every day,) Jacob would always give her hugs and say I love you! It was very cute, I must admit.

But Carol was sitting on her couch, watching TV. Then, she felt a tap on her left shoulder. Startled, she looked over and nothing was there. Then, there was more tapping on her arm. She jumped up and took a few steps away from the couch, not believing what she felt. Note: that she also experienced random tapping after her grandfather died.

Then, a door slammed from down the hall. Carol freaked out and ran into her room, locking the door until her family got home.

There are other incidents that happened, but it would be too long to write them all down. I will end this by saying that they still see him in pictures around Sidney's house, and they also feel his presence once in a while. Although he is gone, he is always in our hearts. This is my first story, so please tell me what you think.

The Haunted Condo,"Ohio, United States",Apparitions / Voices / Touches,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Apparitions / Voices / Touches :: The Haunted Condo

I hope this story makes sense to the people who will read this. I'm 12 right now; I've been living in the condo for about 6 years now. When we first moved into the condo, I woke up to a guy on the foot of my bed waking me up. I thought he was my Great Grandpa. Then I forget if there was anything else that happened to me.

On my birthday when I was younger, I was going down the steps. I felt a hand on my shoulder, and I fell down and was so close to breaking my arm. Then again, I forget if anything else happened to me. Sorry. On my 12th birthday, my aunt and her fiancé were still here. My dad told them about the little boy asking for coke to drink. He thinks that it is from his brother's house because they have a little ghost of a little boy. On the same night, I heard the little boy ask if I could play with them.

After that, I was thinking of my dead dog, Chloe, and then there was a pressure on my feet. I knew it was Chloe because she used to lay there when I was scared at storms. A month after that, my Great Grandma died. I went to my friend's house to get my mind off of her, but it didn't work because Emily had Ouija board.

She asked if I wanted to try it, duh I did. So the first ghost we talked to was a boy named Alex. He was awesome, even though we only talked to him for a while. Then he told me that my Great Grandmother wanted to talk to me. I thought he was lying, but he wasn't. She told me that there was the little boy, but she didn't know who he was, my dog, her, and the guy who shot himself in his garage. He actually haunts everyone's house. But right now, that's all I know.  I'll keep you guys updated if anything else happens

Attacks In The Night,"Wisconsin, United States",Old Hags / Night Attacks / Sleep Paralysis,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Old Hags / Night Attacks / Sleep Paralysis :: Attacks In The Night

I t seems that throughout my life, I have been subject to incidents that cannot be explained... My parents have always described it as an 'overactive' imagination; however I think it's something more. At the moment, I am 14 years old, and I would like to share with you that which I have experienced.

A few years ago, I don't know, maybe I was 7... Maybe 8. I can't recall exactly. But anyways, I was asleep in my bed, which had one side pushed up against the wall. I suddenly awoke with a start - and was instantly filled with a feeling of dread and terror. I tried to move, but my limbs did not respond.

I then suddenly heard laughter, laughter caused by two presences. Their voices both seemed male, one older and darker than the other. Their laughter stopped, and the older one hissed,

The voice was so vivid and distinct; I still recognize exactly how it sounded and felt.

At this time, I felt a sharp pressure on my thighs - like something was pushing me down against the bed. I fought back against this, attempting to kick my arms and legs. The two presences suddenly receded and disappeared, leaving me lying out of breath on my bed.

After explaining the experience to my parents, they simply dismissed it as a dream. A year or so later, a more dramatic incident happened.

I was sleeping once more, in the same bed. I awoke with the same sense of fear, while trying to figure out what was going on. I noticed a shadow stretching out across my doorway, and slowly the figure of a crawling man began to enter my room. It was too dark to notice any distinct features of the creature, but I could see that his head was tilted at an odd angle; as if its neck was broken.

I heard the two voices again, but this time I could not understand what they were saying. The older voice seemed quiet, almost tired. The younger presence seemed excited and loud.

The man was crawling closer and closer to my bed, in which I once again fought and fought - trying to move. I suddenly felt a rush of energy, and I tumbled off the bed and onto the floor. I noticed that the apparition had disappeared, which I was glad of. I then felt drained, and fell asleep there on the floor.

Nothing else significant has happened in the last few years... But after these two incidents, I have moved from my old bedroom into my brother's room, which moved out a few years ago.

As far as I know, this house really has no history. It's only a few years old.

If anyone can help me explain the two presences, then please, don't hesitate to share your thoughts.

Goodnight Grandpa,"Florida, United States",Family / Friends Visits,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Family / Friends Visits :: Goodnight Grandpa

I was about 15 when my grandfather passed away. It was a real loss when he went as he hadn't been ill or at least not that we knew of. He was an incredible man with class, integrity and a real knack for making people feel appreciated. My grandma had passed just a year prior of cancer and the two of them were extremely close. It was the kind of marriage you see that just makes you see what love truly is.

Prior to my grandfathers passing I was fortunate to spend some time with him as a congratulations trip for passing 8th grade. It was something that my grandparents had done with all the grandkids and I was the youngest and last to get the pleasure. Since my grandmother had passed the year of the coveted 8th grade graduation,  my trip was postponed. I was told by my parents that it may never happen because it would be to hard on grandpa. But as I said, my grandpa was a man of great class and he wasn't about to let me be disappointed. I flew out and spent a week with this incredible man. He taught me to waltz, we had long talks and listened to old Broadway records. He asked me questions about myself  and we laughed for hours. At the end of this trip, as I was getting on the plane, my grandfather said to me, ""This is the last time I will see you kiddo."" I said, ""No it's not grandpa I'll be back."" He then said, ""You will but I will be gone. ""He knew then that he was not long for this world.

Within the next 3 months he passed away, after a game of tennis with his friends at the club. He leisurely strolled back to his table to sip his Manhattan and share some laughs when he sighed out loud about the loss on the court that day he folded his arms and was gone.

The family all joined for his services and it seemed like the entire town came out to pay their respects. Everyone that knew him had kind and wonderful words to share. Lots of laughter about his life and his life with Grandma, saying that we all knew they were together. At the viewing I had asked my father if I could have Grandpa's glasses. Everyone thought that was a little weird, but I wanted them .It was such a personal thing for him everyday to HAVE to wear them and they were always with him. I wanted him to always be with me.

That night after the funeral my father, step mom, sister, cousins,  aunt and uncle all stayed at my grandparents home. Everyone going to different rooms except myself and my older sister, we shared a spare room with a pull out sofa bed. As we lie there talking about Grandpa and how we missed him we decided to turn off the light and call it a night. Just as I shut off the light and laid back down the door just cracked open enough to let the hallway night light come in, we heard a soft calming ""goodnight girls"" and we responded with ""goodnight"" and the door closed. Immediately my sister and I said ""THAT WAS GRANDPA..."" not scared but excited. We decided we better ask our family the next day to see if any of them were up and did that. Not surprisingly at all, NO ONE was up,  nor did they open our door that night.

My sister and I know without a shadow of a doubt that Grandpa said goodnight that night in his sweet way of telling us he was OK and we can be too.

My Happiness Was Shattered When I Found Out My House Was Haunted,Canada,Apparitions / Voices / Touches,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Apparitions / Voices / Touches :: My Happiness Was Shattered When I Found Out My House Was Haunted

W hen I was little I thought of my house was the best until I realized that there were things that were un-explainable going on. I've always been interested in ghosts and paranormal activity but, I never thought that it would happen to me!

The first thing that happened was when I was 10 years old. I was in the bathroom brushing my teeth my mum was outside in the garden smoking with my grandma. Then, it went really quiet and I heard a knock on the bathroom door I opened the door to find no-one was there. I was really freaked out by this so, I went down stairs opened the garden screen door and in a really quivering voice I said "" M mum, d did y you j just k knock o on t the b bathroom d door?"" She said ""No sweetie"". My grandma said she didn't either. They reassured me that nothing was nothing to worry about so; I went back upstairs and finished brushing my teeth. Things were okay after that but, not for long!

About eight months later I was sitting on the floor near the basement door playing and, all of a sudden I hear this low deep grumble coming from inside the basement. I thought nothing of it at the time and continued playing. That night when I was in bed I thought to my self ""Was that noise coming from the basement the furnace? No, it couldn't have been .It's impossible for a fernace to make such a low noise!"" I finally got to sleep that night and again things were great for awhile until two years later!

Two years later my friend was over for a sleepover it was just after my twelfth birthday and my mum had gotten me this toy horse that neighs when you touch its forehead. That night I had left the horse on the top of my toy basket. At about midnight I was wide awake when all of a sudden I heard this ""Neigh, Neigh neigh..."" It made me jump out of my skin""! Was my horse being played with by unseen hands?

Other stuff has happened which includes more noises from the basement, doors opening a closing on their own accord, weird noises in the night, people's faces turning up in pictures I have taken.

It always feels like someone's watching me! What should I do? Please feel free to comment! Thank you for reading my story.

At The Museum,Canada,Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: At The Museum

A t the beginning of May I was offered what is to me, a dream summer job. I'm working in my town's museum, giving tours, working with the artifacts, that sort of thing. Absolutely perfect for a history lover like me. The museum is three small buildings. The first building is very small, just one room. It has a few displays to do with the towns sporting history, the first settlers to the area and all our books and archives. It is also where the computer and phone is, so that is where I normally work when there aren't any visitors.

The second building is the barn. This is one big room that is full of old farm equipment and horse racing equipment. The last building is the most popular part of the museum and my personal favorite. It's the log cabin.

The cabin was built in 1860 and had families living in it for the next hundred years. We have it set up so it looks like a typical farm home from the 1880s. To enter you go through the back kitchen than up a few steps into the main room. To the right of the main room are two small bedrooms. On the left is the staircase that goes to the attic, which is one large room that is filled with displays of old clothes. This building was where the strangeness started.

Since the museum is so small I work alone, unless a big tour comes through. On my first day I was walking through the buildings, acquainting myself with all the exhibits, so when people had questions, I would have answers. I went up to the cabins attic. There I was hit with a powerful smell of horses. It was like I had just walked into a stable. After five or ten seconds the smell disappeared, and was replaced by the ordinary museum smell. I looked around to try and find where the smell came from and found, thrown over the back of a chair, an old blanket that was used for people riding in horse drawn carriages about 120 years ago. I picked it up and took a sniff, since it was the only thing even vaguely horse related in the building. But it only smelt of old cloth. Well it was a strange thing, but I had work to do so I put it out of my mind.

A few days later I was again in cabin, sweeping the main room, trying to make it pretty for the days guests when BANG BANG, something began to pound on the front door. Now, the front door is bolted from the inside, and only opened on days when there's a big tour. There is a window beside the door so I could see if anyone passed. I opened the door, but, of course, there was no one. This happened again a few minutes later, and again there was no one. By this point I was getting spooked so I started looking for anything that could account for the noise, tree branch, construction, giant squirrel, anything. But I couldn't find a single explanation.

On another day while I was walking past the barn I heard people talking inside. Thinking it visitors had come in without me seeing I went in to check. Completely empty. Later that same day I was in the back kitchen when I heard footsteps in the main room. Now, there is no way anyone could have gotten in there without passing me. Torn between fear and curiosity, I went in to see what was going on. There was no one in the room, but I saw woman's feet at the top of the stairs going into the attic. She had on dark shoes and a long dress. I followed up the stairs, but when I reached the top the room was empty. Fear overcame curiosity and I ran down the stairs and back to the office where nothing strange ever happens.

Since then I haven't seen anything. I do, however, occasionally hear light footsteps, the swish of a dress, and murmured conversations. I am working in the museum until September, and can't really say if I hope to see more of the ghosts and learn who they are, or if I hope it all quiets down. I guess time will tell.

A Life Long Journey Of Weird Experiences,"Texas, United States",A Haunted Life,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: A Haunted Life :: A Life Long Journey Of Weird Experiences

I really don't know where to start. This is going to be a long one. I guess I can start by saying that my parents have lived in their home for 39 years now. Growing up wasn't peachy in this household. I was the baby of the family. I came 8 years after my parents had their 3rd child. There are four of us all together. 1 brother and 2 sisters. Ages ranging from 38-40. Well there was a lot of yelling and fighting in this household as you can imagine. We were not the perfect family, but things could have been worse, right?

Okay moving on. As a kid (about 8) I remember laying out in the den with my two sisters watching whatever was on TV and I told my oldest sister that I was hot and she said she was, too. Not even a minute later, the ceiling fan turned on. And we were in awe of course, but we figured the dial (old 70's ceiling fan) wasn't fully on the switch.

I grew up with a family who LOVED horror movies. I still love them to this day. My evil brother and sisters loved to torture me by making me watch them at a very young age. Most of them were cheesy, but I was terrified of the paranormal, demonic ones. Like The Evil Dead and The Exorcist, the Exorcist especially. I didn't get over that movie until I was at least 21. Now I can watch it like nothing.

My sisters and sometimes their friends continued to torture me by playing my mom's Ouija board (which she got as a present when she was only TWELVE). They'd ask it stupid questions and make up answers. Normal stuff, right? I remember one guy asked it when I was going to die and I was so upset and they just laughed and laughed. I laugh about it today actually.

Moving on to my teenage years. I remember my oldest sister and me watching TV out in the den and we had one lamp in the den and a kitchen window light on aside from the TV light. Well, one night we saw this huge shadow appear across the back door of the den area and we both assumed it was our dad, who is a big guy. We both turned around to look and no one was there. I remember my sister and I looking at each other like ""what was that?"" I laughed and walked to my parent's room and asked my dad if he had just came into that room and he said no. He and my mom looked at me crazy of course.

A lot of weird stuff happened when I was a teen, but I'll leave that out. I can't categorize it (because it wasn't really paranormal, I don't think... just weird coincidences), but it was weird nonetheless. If you want to know more about that, then I can post another entry, but for now we'll move on.

My sister (the 3rd child) and her husband moved into a house down the street from us. And I was often over there. Not too soon after moving in, weird, unexplained things were happening. I remember the first day I ever went over there, I felt weird. The previous owners had this gaudy full length mirror in the kitchen that was parallel to the entry way to the hall. So you could see down the hall if your back was to it. It gave me the creeps. Surprisingly, that was the only thing that really creeped me out. I guess I watched Poltergeist III too many times.

Anyway, I know standing in the kitchen cooking or washing dishes, it always felt like someone was standing behind you and looking over your shoulder. It wasn't threatening but it was definitely weird. There was a window in the kitchen that looked out into the converted den area that the previous owners had built.

Again, I was at this house A LOT. I got pregnant at 18 and I used to baby-sit for my sister and her husband all the time. When I was alone at night, I would hear my name being called. In both a whisper and regular talking voice. It was very odd. I would hear the phone ring when I was on it. Ha-ha, I know that sounds bizarre, but it happened! I spent a lot of the time in the front room where the computer was. And often I would hear small feet run down the hallway (the same one I mentioned before that the mirror in the kitchen faced). I thought it was my 2 year old niece getting out of her crib and running down the hall. I would walk down and look for her and she wasn't there. I would walk to her and her sister's bedroom and find her asleep in her crib. The light would be on and I would turn it off. A little bit later, I would hear the little feet running down the hall and I would look and find their bedroom light on again. This happened a lot.

I finally just gave up on investigating and went on with my business.

One night my sister had gone out with some friends and was out all night. Her husband worked graveyard, so I was there babysitting once again. I was sitting out in the den when I heard a clacking sound in the kitchen. It sounded like my sister walking into the kitchen with a certain pair of shoes she wore that made that sound and I heard her call my name. Loudly, I might add. Like she was looking for me. I asked ""What?"" and I got no answer. I got up and walked into the kitchen and no one was there. I thought maybe she was really drunk and passed out in her bed... No one was in there either. The front door was still locked as well. I thought maybe she had left again. I really didn't think too much of it at the time. When she finally came home, I asked her what she had wanted and she looked at me weird. I said, ""When you came home. You called my name in the kitchen, what did you want?"" She told me she had never came home. I was a little spooked... as was she, but again we just laughed it off. She's told me some of her weird experiences, too but most of them are like mine. They no longer live there. I often wonder if the new tenants experience anything.

I had my daughter in 1997. Nothing unusual really happened for the first 2 years of her life. That of course, changed. One day I noticed that when a toy rolled or was thrown anywhere my closet was, she would walk slowly to that area and run back crying hysterically. Of course at the age of 2, she wasn't able to explain to me what was going on. This freaked me out. I asked my sisters to come over and see what I saw. They thought it was weird, too. It scared me. I felt helpless because I couldn't protect her from seeing or feeling whatever was there.

My sister gets this ""bright"" idea to do the Ouija board in my room. I was so against it, but they did it anyway. They closed their eyes and began concentrating. I don't remember what they asked the board, exactly, but they BOTH stopped breathing for at least a minute and had tears in their eyes when they came to. I told them to get the hell out of my room. I didn't want that crap in here.

Well things got worse. My friend, who was a skeptic saw a tall dark figure in my house one night and I about freaked and told her to stop lying. She swore up and down that she saw a dark figure standing in the doorway with a top hat on. Well like a week later, without telling ANYONE about what she saw, my sisters bring up some story about the ""shadow man"" that they remember encountering as kids. And they said he walked across the backyard in broad daylight and it freaked them out. When they told me what he looked like... I told them to shut up! They said he had a top hat on as well. I was freaked out.

My sister (closest to my age) was staying a week at my parents house because she and her husband were fighting. Well, one night she had gone out with her friends and came home completely lit. She was staggering and slurring. I laughed at her. She asks me if I want to get high (weed, nothing else) and I was like, yeah okay. So we go out into the garage and I take 2 hits off a joint. JUST TWO and we come back in and I'm feeling pretty relaxed but I'm not stoned. We joke and laugh about whatever for awhile. Time passes and I get hungry and she says she needs to use the restroom.

I go into the kitchen and she goes out of the room down the hall to the bathroom. I begin heating up left overs in the microwave and I start laughing to myself because I thought of something funny about her husband (I don't even remember what) and I turn around wondering where she was because I didn't hear or see her walk back into the room and a lot of time had passed. When I turned around she was standing in the doorway and looking forward at the wall in front of her and she had no expression on her face. I looked at her and laughed thinking ""she is so trashed..."" She walks slowly, without staggering, to the couch and sits on the edge of the couch. Her back straight, her knees together and her hands on her knees. I'm, of course, thinking ""what the hell is she doing?""

Well I go on and tell her what I was laughing about and she's not giving me any response. So I call her name to get her attention and she turns her head towards me and says, ""Yes?"" and then slowly turns her head back towards the TV that she had been looking at prior. I start to get a little creeped out and ask her to stop doing whatever she was doing. I plead with her to stop messing around and she just looks at me and that look just like cut right through me. I was completely terrified.

I dropped whatever was in my hand and ran out of the room into my oldest sister's room (who was asleep, by the way) screaming and crying. She tries to calm me down and I try to explain to her what happened. Mind you, I was like 20 or so years old at the time and I was terrified and in hysterics. My oldest sister practically drags me into the other room to confront my other sister. And my other sister has NO IDEA what I'm talking about. I didn't want to be anywhere near her. My oldest sister is still trying to calm me down and tells me to breathe, so I can explain what happened. I tell them both and my sister freaks out and she's scared because she can see how scared I am. My oldest of course, thinks I'm nuts and is pissed that we both woke her up.

To this day, my sister still denies being involved in any of that. She has a completely different story. She claims she walked from the bathroom into the den and was watching Madonna on MTV. I've pretty much blame the marijuana now looking back at it. Not that I had ever hallucinated on smoking weed, much less just from two hits of a joint, but I can't find any other logical explanation.

My oldest sister was skeptical about some of the stuff my other sister and I had gone through. She hadn't really experienced much other than the big dark shadow in our den area, seeing my daughter's reaction to that area by my closet and of course, the ""shadow man"". Well one morning, I woke up to what sounded like furniture moving in the other room and I heard keys jangling as well. I didn't think much of it. I thought it was my sister rearranging furniture. She was known to do that.

Well I got me and my daughter dressed and I walked over to my sister's town home (which was a little further down the street from the house she had once lived in). I get there and maybe 30 minutes later, the phone rings and it's my oldest sister telling my other sister that she was hearing things move. I was like ""WHAT?"" and I explained to her that I had heard the same thing but I thought it was HER doing it. She of course was a little freaked out now. Then she screamed and a loud crash and the phone hung up. I don't know if she accidentally hung it up or did it for show, but nonetheless the connection was lost. We kept trying to call her back but she wouldn't answer. Finally, we go a hold of her again and she was frantic. She said the vacuum cleaner just fell over out of nowhere and other things fell down, too. She said she was on her way over. My sister and I laughed at her, to be honest because we thought, ""FINALLY, she understands now!""

In the same year, I was over at my friend's house with my daughter and we left to go to 7-11 or something. It's summer and in Texas it's HOT. Even late at night. Well we pull to the end of the road and my daughter starts screaming and kicking and trying to get out of her car seat and she keeps covering her eyes and I think maybe a bee or bug is back there and my friend, who had better access to her, reaches over and tries to calm her down. She looked at me and told me it was extremely cold back there where my daughter was at. I told her to take me home! Once I got my daughter out of the car, she was fine. Strange.

The whispering of the names continued and an eerie feeling that something was around continued for awhile. I told it to go and that it wasn't wanted here at both my sister's town home and at my parent's house and things went back to normal. Well nothing too odd or scary at least. There are still some things that happen, but I just ignore it now.

After the ""weed"" incident... I feel as if I maybe brought this on with my own mind. Like I willed it to happen, which takes me back to some weird occurrences when I was a teen. I used to say things and they would happen. It used to freak my friends out. Maybe subconsciously I wanted to experience it. I know that sounds crazy, but the mind is a powerful thing. Someone once told me that I seemed to make it manifest. I don't know. It's definitely something I'll never forget. I tell people about it and some believe me and some don't. It's to be expected, though.

I'm definitely a skeptic when it comes to other people's stories though. Crazy, huh?

The House 2,"Ohio, United States",Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: The House 2

T hanks to everyone who requested more about the boogie man and about things that happened in ""The House"" I have very limited time to write, but I plan to post my experiences in small segments. As I mentioned before, I had my first experience when I was five, (at least that I remember). I personally believe in a spirit realm, in part because of these occurrences. However, it was not until my ex-husband had a premonition, that I became a firm believer. (I will put this story on Psychic-Experiences.) Prior to this I wondered if I just had a vivid overactive imagination. I am a Christian, and I believe my experiences can be explained biblically. I am just beginning to try to search for those answers. However, I believe without a doubt that we are constantly intertwined with another sphere. Perhaps as you read you will become convinced too.

As I stated in the first story of ""The House,"" I never went into that attic again. However, when my dad came home, he went up there and checked it out. Upon his return, he said that he did not see anything, but that there were no holes or openings that he could see, so he did not think that it was a bird or bat. Surprisingly, he believed me and told my mother that this was an old house, and that quite possibly, a spirit or two could be present.

No sooner did he finish his affirming statement; when a loud rustling sound came from the attic. With his eyes wide, he immediately rushed back up into the attic. The intensity I felt increased with every step I heard him take above me as the hairs on my arms stiffened from raised goose pimples to rigid needles. I was terrified as the door opened, half expecting my now racing heart to leap out of my chest if the shadow-like thing was going to be there at the door instead of my dad. Thankfully, it was my dad, and he said nothing was up there that he could see, but he knew we all heard it. The sound seemed like a set of horizontal blinds falling down from a window. However, there were no blinds on the windows up there, or anywhere else in the house for that matter.

Later we sat downstairs, eating our pizza staring at each other in an eerie silence and with an occasional exaggerated jerk in response to the slightest creek in the house. My dad decided to turn on some music while we ate. No sooner did he turn around from the stereo, the radio stopped. My dad simply said that we would have to get an antenna. When I protested, he went on to explain that he had seen many radios shut off, and that it may not be a ghost or spirit, but that if there was one, we would all learn to get along. Although, I secretly hoped that he was right that it just needed an antenna. Despite being scarred, and having a hard time getting to sleep, I survived the first night in the house.

When I woke up in the morning, I noticed that my closet door was open. I knew it was shut before I went to bed because I looked at it to make sure, since I was so scared the night before. I sprang from my bed and went to my mother who downstairs making coffee. I cut her off her good morning greeting to urgently ask if she had been in my room, particularly in my closet. She said, no and asked why. I told her about it being open even though I knew it was shut. She said we would have to ask Dad when he got up. However, he denied being in there too. He tried to suggest that perhaps it did not have a tight fit or that the knob could be stuck or something. So we went up to check. The closet door was shut! Furthermore, when he went to open it, he had to turn the knob all of the way and pull hard because the door fit quite tight. Thankfully, nothing came flying out. At that point he told me that he thought I was playing up the ghost thing. However, after my insisting that it was not me, and that I was absolutely sure without any doubt about it being closed when I went to bed and open when I woke up, he admitted that the door shuts firmly and should not come open by itself, and if I was not playing it up, then it sure could possibly be a spirit letting us know it was here.

Tagging close behind him we went back downstairs. He went for the coffee, and I poured a bowl of cereal. Next we sat at the table with my mother in the kitchen. I began to tell her about what happened, and that I thought there was something weird going on. Suddenly to our amazement the radio turned on! It happened completely on its own. We all just starred wide eyed and dumfounded at each other. Slowly my dad went and turned the radio down. He said that maybe we would not need an antenna after all. Nervously, I asked my mom if anyone ever died in this house. She said she did not know, and to not let my mind wonder or it would play tricks on me. As we talked about the strangeness, the radio began to tune in an out, but it also got louder and softer. I looked back and forth between my mom and dad searching their eyes urgently for answers. They both had the same bewildered look that validated the fear I felt. My dad quickly explained that we just needed an antenna after all.

At this point I exclaimed that the tuning would not make it get louder and lower! I walked in and peered at the stereo, like it would give me answers. Even though this was in 1984, we had a digital stereo as my dad always liked his electronic toys. The station lights were not simply dimming as it had in the past when the station was not getting reception. To my horror the tuner was being turned and the numbers flashed showing the numbers getting bigger and smaller. Additionally as it got louder, the volume light indicator rose or declined as it lowered.

My dad calmed me and said there had to be an explanation. He turned it off, and put in a tape. However, after one song, even that turned off. He put in another tape. He said that there seemed to be a spirit. He talked to it out loud and said that he would put in something else and that he hopped the spirit liked it and reminded me and the ghost that we would all have to get along. I could not believe he was saying this, but it at least made me feel less crazy, at least I knew this was really happening.

My dad went back into the kitchen and began looking at the stove that he had to connect. The new tape continued without problems or ""interference..."" I looked at my mom and she just shrugged. I demanded to know how they could just go on like nothing was happening and that if the house was haunted, weren't they crazy for staying? My mother was calming and insisted that there be another explanation. My dad said there was nothing we could do anyway, that it was our house now and the spirit would see we were no threat, and besides it seemed mischievous and not mean, if indeed it really was a spirit. I held fast to this reasoning and forced myself to be convinced that it was true, while I secretly hoped he was right.

Meanwhile we went on making it our home, and nothing more happened that day, but there would be more over the next two years. Little did I know how right I was to have suspicion of the spirit's intentions.

Possible Incubus Encounter,"New Jersey, United States",Succubus / Incubus / Sexual Ghosts,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Succubus / Incubus / Sexual Ghosts :: Possible Incubus Encounter

E ver since I was a little girl, I've felt like I was being watched. It got to the point where I refused to get changed in my bedroom. Every night, I would go to the bathroom to change into my pajamas and the same thing in the mornings. At this time, I was thinking it was along the lines of someone putting cameras in my bedroom, or my neighbors watching me through my window. It wasn't until later that I even considered the paranormal. At that point, though, I had decided to try and ignore the paranoid feeling, but it never fully went away. Sometimes, when I got out of the shower, I would feel like someone was standing in front of me, scrutinizing my body. I ignored it to the best of my ability and was finally getting used to the strange feelings, until about a year ago, the summer I turned 15.

My parents had never owned a house before, and our landlords were refusing to put the house we were living in up for sale, so we were moving to a different house in the same town. My siblings and I were staying at my grandmother's house while my parents got the furniture into the new house. One night I had a strange sensation. It felt sort of... tingly all over. The tingles were almost in the shape of hands. Like a ton of hands were touching me all over my body. I got pretty scared and got up to get a glass of water and walk around a little. Though it helped at first, the minute I laid back down, I would feel these hands. They were touching me in sexual ways. My stomach, chest and between my legs. After a while, I just tried to ignore it and lay down anyway. I moved my legs together tightly, trying to block entrance, and curled up in a ball.

This happened continuously for a while, and the more I let it happen the less it did. I still have a similar sensation today, although it has calmed down significantly. It only feels like one person, or one set of hands. Once or twice, I've woken up feeling aroused like it was touching me in my sleep (but never have I ever felt anything inserted. Even when I do feel the sensation in the lower region of my body, it only feels like touches). That hasn't happened recently though. Recently, it has been very gentle. For instance, I will sometimes feel the tingling sensation underneath my hair, like someone is combing their fingers through my hair, or it'll feel like someone is cupping my cheek. On rare occasions, I've even felt the sensation on my lips. This usually happens at night, when I'm trying to sleep, but I feel it during the day too. Another thing I've noticed is that the sensation will sometimes start at my feet and work it's way up, lingering in some areas.

I have to say, I feel a little crazy writing this as fact. I'm not even positive if I can truly call this paranormal. All I know is this is something I can't explain. For a while, I thought maybe I was just making it up. Creating this make believe person because of my longing for a boyfriend, but I couldn't seem to conjure the tingling feeling when I really wanted to feel it, only at times when I wasn't begging for it. So, it could be very possible that I'm just crazy and I'm starting to slip into my imagination, but I'm starting to believe more and more that this is real.

So this story is more like a search for answers than anything else.

Is this real? Or am I just making it up? Has anyone else experienced anything like this before?",https://www.yourghoststories.com/real-ghost-story.php?story=3195
It Was Not Sleep Paralysis,"California, United States",Misc,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Misc :: It Was Not Sleep Paralysis

T his story takes place 8 years ago when I was 17 years old and going through my rebellious teenage years. My best friend Lola and I worked at a Deli shop were she was the manager so we spent a lot of time together. I was hanged with the wrong crowd and doing things that I shouldn't have been doing (this is the past) which included drug use.

My friend Lola lived with her boyfriend Robby who was also a manager at the Deli shop and we constantly partied together. We would have Crazy nights were we would stay up 2 days straight just hanging in the apartment and listening to music and having people over.

One night it was just Lola, Robby, and I. We were using drugs and listening to the Godsmack C.D. I don't know if you know who Godsmack is but most of there lyrics are Diabolic or about drug use. We all got real into the C.D. especially the song ""Voo Doo"". We were talking crazy stuff and just pretty much stayed up all night.

I finally went home the next night and fell asleep almost instantly. At about 3am I woke up and could not move. This has happened to me before and my mother always told me to just pray to God and it will go away which did usually work.

This time it was different. As guilty as I felt, I did pray but it didn't work. I was sleeping on my side and was able to look at my stereo which I had left turned off but it was on and the lights were moving across and the time said 3am. I thought maybe I did leave it on but when I looked at the back it was disconnected! I panicked and screamed as loud as I could for my mom and dad but almost nothing more than a whisper came out.

I must have snapped out of it and I got up and tried to open the door but it would not move! I was locked in my room. All of a sudden I felt a push throw me back on the bed. All I remember was just laying there waiting for morning. I must have fallen asleep because when I woke up it was light outside.

The next day when I went to work I told Lola what had happened. When I finished my story she made this face I could never forget. She told me that the same exact thing happened to her and Robby that night at around the same time.

After this experience I quit my partying. I don't know why but to this day I think that listening to the Godsmack C.D. is what caused this and I also don't believe that sleep paralysis is a medical condition. I believe its something more paranormal and demonic.

This is the first story I am submitting so I hope you enjoyed it and would like to hear your opinion. If you have any questions feel free to ask or send me and email.

My G-maw Aka Granny,"Tennessee, United States",Family / Friends Visits,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Family / Friends Visits :: My G-maw Aka Granny

M y granny passed away in January 08. I guess you can say we were pretty close, because she stayed with us. At first, she was staying with her son. She a triple by pass surgery. We couldn't afford to take care of her at the time so my uncle took her in. Eventually, he put her out. We never knew why, but we just dealt with it, and did the best we could do.

So she started staying with us. And of course we would fall out, because she and I were exactly the same I guess, but we understood each other. Right after New Years 2008 she became sick. She was a stubborn old lady, so she wouldn't go to the hospital. One day it got so bad that I called 911. I felt guilty, because she had fallen in the floor. (I was upstairs and she was downstairs) I couldn't hear her calling me and I couldn't hear my phone when she called.

When I finally got up I went downstairs and she was sitting on the floor just picking stuff up off the carpet. I asked her how she got there she just said ""I was trying to get to the couch..."" I was scared to move her so I just called 911. They came and took her to the hospital. I had to call my mom so she could come home so we could go to the hospital with her. When we saw her she was talking and laughing. But they wanted to go ahead and take her to the hospital to make sure was okay.

The weirdest thing happened while we were there with her. They called my mom to the emergency room, while back there my mom was talking to granny, and at the end of the conversation my mom said "" I love you"" and my granny sat straight up in the bed and said "" I love you too"", but the scariest part that my mom said was when she said it, it was like she wasn't even talking to her. She was looking past my mom like she wasn't even there. My mom came back and told me this and when she told me I knew what was going to happen.

They found out that her potassium shot up so high that it turned into poison. They were doing dialysis to get the poison out. But she wasn't responding anymore after the first day. The second day she still wasn't responding. The doctors didn't know what was wrong with her. The third day was the same. The fourth day they ran tests and found out that she had a stroke and was brain dead. My mother decided my sister and I should be there to watch her pass at 64 years old.

Of course, I stayed and watched to be strong for my mother, but after all of that, that's when things started to a little crazy for me. I was fine the whole month, but after that I started having dreams about her. One dream I remember is that she was with all her children and grandchildren and so on and so on. All together there were 5 generations (nobody in our family has seen 5 generations) so it was a little off for me. Granny was just talking to us. Telling us stories then it jumps straight to her funeral. With all the generations lined up in order. It was just weird to me. Some dreams I would wake up with cold sweats others I would wake up crying.

I don't know if any of the dreams are significant, but they sure do get to me. Out of all the dreams I have, I always remember the ones with Granny. I have asked my mom about them she says granny is just stopping by to say hey. But my mom doesn't have the dreams, and my sister doesn't. So I guess what I'm trying to figure out is why me?

Our First Place Together,"North Carolina, United States",Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: Our First Place Together

A s soon as I graduated from high school, my sweetie Jeff and I were hell bent to move out on our own ASAP. So we decided to move out that summer with a mutual friend of ours, we'll call him Rob.

It was the summer of 1999, and the house Rob and Jeff found was an adorable two bedroom with a large kitchen and dining room. I loved it for its hardwood floors and country feel. I loved that there was farmland across the street and past our huge back yard. The back yard had a small grape vine and a giant, ancient cherry tree. The cherries were awesome! The grapes were okay tasting.

One thing that disturbed me was the memory of a crime scene at this residence the year before. There was crime scene tape around the house for at least a month. I remember having to stop as cops waved traffic through. Regardless of the concern I moved in. I was on speaking terms to with the neighbor to the left, and she said that there was a bad drug deal there the year before and a young black man had died there in one of the bed rooms. I automatically assumed it was the smaller bed room occupied by Rob. We all know what they say about assuming! She also said that the landlords mother used to own the place, and died there of natural causes. I knew she had lived there from the landlord as he bragged about how she had decorated the place. I really think she protected me there.

The first instance I had with a ghost/encounter to paranormal in that house was the very first night I stayed there. Rob and I decided to stay so we could get and early start on unpacking as Jeff had to work the next morning. Sometime during the night while I was sleeping, Rob's dumb butt closed the door while we had a large kerosene heater in the room. I faintly remember waking a little feeling hot and strange and falling back to sleep, almost like I was unable to wake up. Then I heard my name being called over and over along with wake up, and it sounded like my mom. Finally I woke up, got up, opened the door and lay back down. I slept maybe an hour or two more as the sun was up in early morning when I finally got out of bed with a head ache. I moved the heater out of the room, and got myself going for the day, hot tea and ibuprofen!

I really liked living there despite the lack of real closet and storage space. I didn't see shadows or anything, but a lot of times I would see things darting around in the corner of my eyes. I did get a full body apparition out of the corner of my eye. It was in the kitchen when I was making a large meal for the company that night. I saw an old woman with short gray and white hair and a light pink and light blue flowered moo moo (old lady pajamas). I turned and looked, and she wasn't there. I turned back to the pork roast with sauerkraut and she was back. I looked again, nobody, and she was out of my peripheral. Considering I was making a ""Yankee"" meal and she would have been an old southern lady, I felt like she was wondering what in the world I was doing to that pork!

I would get a tremendous feeling of being watched while in the master bed room Jeff and I shared. This feeling was particularly intense while I was alone in the room. It is strange I would also think I'd see things in my dresser mirror here, and that has only happened at my mom's as well, but not where I currently live, which is also haunted.

After living there a few months, a night came when I was trying to go to sleep while Jeff, Rob and some friends were all in the living room playing video games. The feeling of being watched was worse than ever! It was emanating from the black reaches of the closet. Well I got the bright idea that I would see if there really was something there by confronting it. ""If you are here and can understand me, give me a sign, like sitting at the end of the bed or something...""Very shortly after I said that, there was the distinct feeling of someone plopping down next to my foot. I froze. I hadn't really expected an answer. I could see a definite indention on the bed. Then the thing started moving! Through the light coming in through the cracked open door and the window behind the bed, I could see the covers pulling slowly at my side as if someone were inching up the bed. Every hair on my body stood up and I held my breath. I thought I heard crackling breathing that wasn't my own. As it reached my elbow, in a fit of adrenaline and fear, I shot up like a rocket and bolted into the living room full of guys in nothing but a t-shirt and panties! I had tears in my eyes, ""There's something in there! There is something in there!"" I repeated trembling. The guys all jumped up grabbing brooms and mops thinking there was a rodent or squirrel or something. I let them explore saying I thought I saw it in the closet feeling embarrassed knowing I would be ridiculed for ghost stories if I told the truth. I told Jeff later when the hunt was over what happened but he brushed it of as a bad dream. I told him you had to be sleeping to have a bad dream but he didn't pay any attention to me. I told nobody else after that. But that night I stayed up late with the guys having a couple of beers! And I made Jeff switch sides of the bed with me!

The next day when I was alone, about to go to work, I told the spirit to never do that again, and to go home to the light. And if it didn't go, at least quit watching me so darn bad! I still felt watched though.

Another thing to happen there revolved around Jeff. His personality did a 180. He was fine the first four months or so. But more and more he turned into a real jerk and would freak out over absolutely nothing. His temper became something to never reckon with. He would blame me for things that happened in the house that I had nothing to do with and was obviously so to everyone else. He would call me names, and even came close to hitting me once. After we moved it is like he was back to his normal self. He was a completely different person in that house. And we had been together for three years prior and for nine years since without incident like that, so it wasn't like I was getting to know the real him or something.

When we moved, we had a friend who worked in the carpet business, and replaced the carpet in the bedroom for us so we could get our security deposit back. (I forgot about a huge candle I left burning and it made a giant wax spot.) We helped him, since Jeff used to lay carpet, and ripping it up is easy. When we ripped up the carpet there was a massive stain on the floor that really looked like blood to me. I did always find it odd that it was the only room in the whole house that was carpeted.

The sad thing is, Jeff brings that house up now and again and says that he wishes we could have stayed there. He is about to start a better job in the fall, and we will be in the market to rent a new place or even buy. He is hoping we can get that house again. It's almost like he's drawn to that place! I just hope the people who are there stay there! I am not moving back!

Odd Spirit In Bed,Canada,Succubus / Incubus / Sexual Ghosts,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Succubus / Incubus / Sexual Ghosts :: Odd Spirit In Bed

I have read stories about people being pinned down in beds. Mine is very different, and touchy-feely, violating at times, though. I will skip my early ghost experiences and on to the recent ones. I am not sure if it's even a ghost, but I can feel real, solid hands on me, so I will assume it is.

The first time this ghost came to me, I think I was skipping church and lying in bed, yes, it was a guilty and wrong thing to do. I was tired when these hands began to touch my chest, like massaging them! It was obviously creepy because I was lying down on my back, and the hands were from behind me. I guess either the hands just sprouted out of the bed or there was ghost beneath my bed, or... Oh, I don't know. But it happened, and it was weird! I felt the urge to get out of bed and take a look at where the hell the hands were coming from, but I was way too scared. I just closed my eyes and prayed with no effect; let's not skip church, people!

My second experience with that spirit was a month or so after that. I was sleeping when I felt someone beside me. It was a girl; I do not know how I could tell, but I just knew it was a girl. That ghost or whatever it is hugged me from behind tightly and kept on whispering things into my ear. I could not understand what it was saying. I only remember that it was whispering things to me. The hug and touch was so realistic, I am still surprised that it was not my sister playing tricks on me or something like that. I prayed out of fear when that ghost was hugging me, but again, there was no effect. The scariest thing about that was that the ghost would let go of me, and then hug me from behind again. It was not cold or warm or whatever. It was touching me, and that was all that mattered.

From then on, nothing happened for a while until after a couple months. Sometimes, while I was sleeping, a ghost would hold my hands and hug me and stuff in my bed and I would be too paralyzed to move. I would like to make it clear here that it was not like something was pinning me on my stomach or anything, I just could not move, and realistic touches were on me.

Just recently, I was on a plane with over 50 people from my school on a massive school trip. I fell asleep on the plane, and I instantly began feeling that spirit on me; it touched me in a completely violating way (it was near rape). You know what, if it had been a guy spirit, I could have at least said to myself, ""what a dreadful, violating ghost!"" but it was a girl spirit, so that just freaked me out. It's a girl spirit every time.

I'm completely straight, so that's just freakier. I wish some ghosts would at least respect the others' sexuality if they're going to go around violating others. Anyway, back to the story. I 'woke' up from the paralyzed, eye-closed state and I was embarrassed because I would have seemed weird, somewhat twitching and moaning for it to leave me alone. I can't say anything when I'm paralyzed. But when I asked the girl who sat next to me about it, she said that nothing happened: I was simply asleep. I wasn't twitching or anything like that. Perhaps I had dreamed it all. But the dream was so real, and I've had realistic dreams before, that it wasn't even funny.

Still I find myself paralyzed at times and spirits touching me, no, not in a violating way, but still, in my bed. Maybe its sleep paralysis or a dream or whatever that I cannot move. Can someone explain to me why the hell I feel such realistic touches on me? I looked all over the internet and could not find many stories about completely realistic touches WITHOUT serious ""pinning-down-ness"" (excuse my horrible vocabulary). I would just like some explanations to why all this is happening and how I can stop them. Or at least: could I get a guy spirit haunting me instead of a girl spirit? Uggh...

Leaving Old Castle,United Kingdom,Poltergeists / Physical Manifestations,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Poltergeists / Physical Manifestations :: Leaving Old Castle

O ver the past few weeks I have moved out of Old Castle into my own place with my partner and daughter. About a week before I moved out I was in the kitchen (an original part of the house) with my brother Christopher. We were watching something on the T.V. On top of the T.V was my mobile phone. Suddenly my mobile ""flew"" of the top of the TV and landed at Chris's feet. We just looked at each other and he started to laugh and say a few words that I won't type on here.

At first I thought maybe the vibrations caused by the volume of the TV had knocked the mobile off but the thing is Christopher was sitting at least 3 meters from the TV, and the phone didn't just simply slide of and drop to the floor it literally ""flew"" over the room. Just in case though I picked up my mobile and put it back on top of the TV to see if the same thing would happen again, it didn't, so I got up went over to the TV and pushed the phone off, as I thought it dropped to the floor just in front of the TV.

During that last week I also kept getting ""poked"" in the side and on my shoulder, although I have to admit due to my kidney problem I have dismissed this as anything supernatural, even though the poking in my shoulder wouldn't be from any kidney problem?

Last week my mom and the rest of the family moved out of the property as well. Me and my partner also helped them move. Whilst waiting on the drive for my mom to come back with the moving van ,my partner had parked our car at an angle in front of the kitchen window. We were talking in the car when I suddenly felt uncomfortable. Looking up I saw a shadow standing just a bit back from the window, no one was in the house and the kitchen was completely empty, as we'd moved all the stuff from there the previous day. I quickly looked away, my partner seeing this asked what was wrong, I told him that I could see a shadow of someone in the kitchen. He decides to get out of the car and look through the window ""There's no one in there"" but as I looked up I could still see it.

My partner thinks I'm crazy and insists there was nothing in the kitchen. He has never believed in the supernatural although he has had experiences since living with me . Maybe I didn't see anything in the kitchen though, it could have been the angle that I was sitting at, although it did have a ""human"" shape to it?

Whispering Women,Canada,Apparitions / Voices / Touches,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Apparitions / Voices / Touches :: Whispering Women

M y first story happened when I was around 10 or 11 years old. My family was moving into a new house in Lac La Hache, British Columbia, Canada. The first day we were there, while we were still bringing all our things in, I was taking a break in the living room, which was still empty and devoid of furniture or anything. I was lying around on the edge of the carpet, near a heat vent that led to the basement, talking to my younger brother, and that was the first time I felt something there. It was just a sort of creeped out feeling that I couldn't quite ignore, and eventually I just talked my brother into going outside because it was bothering me a bit.

When we first got all settled in, my brother and I were sharing a bedroom upstairs while my parents put rooms for us in the basement, which had been unfinished when we moved in. They painted the walls and put up siding, and my mother painted each of us a personalized closet door - they were lovely little spaces. Our rooms were set up a few feet from the bottom of the stairs, and the wood stove was directly beside the bottom of the stairs. Behind the wood stove was a large, empty, musty room with a chute going outside for firewood to be thrown in and stacked for easy access in the wintertime, and there was a pantry under the stairs and behind this room.

My brother and I each had one high window in our rooms, above our head level at the time, so my parents put a dresser below each of our windows so we could climb out in case of fire. We had an open doorway between our rooms with a curtain for privacy so I could run through to my brother's room without having to open a door or anything, since he's a few years younger than me and was only about 7 at the time, and I would need to be able to help him if need be. We even had a few fire drills. I knew exactly what to do in case of fire, and could do it in less than a minute, with me and my brother out safe.

After we moved into the basement, things were okay for about a week before I started hearing voices. They sounded like 10 to 15 women (the number 13 pops into my head, but that might be something I picked up later through pop culture) whispering in a gossipy way. Sometimes they would be talking about my family, sometimes they would be talking about me, which I knew even though I couldn't directly hear what they were saying. The voices were coming from the room behind the stove where the wood would be stacked.

A short time after these voices became manifest, I started developing a fear bordering on paranoia that the house was going to burn down, as well as a phobia of fire in general. It was a constant fear, and I remember many times going up to cry to my parents that the house was going to burn down that night. I also couldn't get within a foot of a campfire or fire pit fire, which I always used to love. I also started wetting the bed again, after having stopped that long before, and I remember spending many sleepless nights reading novels by my night light because I was too afraid to sleep. I'd never been a fearful child like that before moving to this house.

The most notable incidents that happened while I lived there were...well, frankly terrifying. The first was one night after I had accidentally watched the end of a TV show that came on after our family movie night (Back to the Future 3!) that portrayed a pianist who had gotten drunk and burned his hands in order to collect the insurance he took out on his hands. This put images of fire in my mind, and I think that's why I was more susceptible to what happened.

That night, I woke up inexplicably terrified and was certain that I could hear paper rustling at the foot of my bed. I glanced down at the foot of my bed and there was nothing there, so I tried to go back to sleep, putting my head down, only to hear a match strike and fire crackling at the foot of my bed. I pulled my feet up, terrified even though I couldn't feel any heat there, and when I looked down again there was nothing there. I was so exhausted from so many nights of lost sleep that I guess I fell asleep eventually. I don't remember the sound stopping.

Another notable incident happened quite shortly after the fire on the end of my bed. I could hear the voices whispering and whispering loudly, and tried to remind myself that it was just the sound of heat moving through the vents, or my parents talking to each other in their room like I had been told. But then the voices coalesced together into one voice (it sounded like many voices talking in tight unison) that told me to go into my bedroom and hit my brother. I got an image of it in my mind, me walking into my brother's room and hitting him with my fist, right in his face. Growing up, my brother was my best friend and my only real constant playmate. I love my brother dearly, and have always felt protective over him since he has developmental disabilities. The last thing in the world I wanted to do was hit my brother, but these voices kept urging me to do it. Eventually I screwed up my courage and, angry that these voices would ever tell me to hurt my brother, I went through the curtain door between our rooms. I leaned over his bed and the voices were telling me yes, yes... And I leaned down, tucked him in, and kissed his forehead while he slept peacefully. The voices stopped and didn't start again that night.

The final incident is when my mother asked me to get some vegetables from the pantry under the stairs, in a long, narrow room that went behind that haunted wood room. I went down and the moment I got near that pantry I was suffused with the worst terror I have ever known in my life. I turned the light on, but even though there was a light the room looked dim, and it was freezing cold, my teeth were chattering. The closer I got to the door, the more I almost felt like I hurt. When I walked into the room, I felt like I was being flayed alive, but not to that level of pain. It was like sheer hatred was sandpapering my skin all over. It is the absolute most terrifying, malevolent presence I have ever felt in my life. I grabbed the vegetables, slammed the door, and bolted up the stairs as if my life depended on it. I sometimes wonder if it did. To this day, I have no idea what was in that room, but I know it was different than the voices, which were just petty and a bit mean. This presence... I know it wanted to kill me that day.

There was one single experience at that place that I could consider almost positive. I was outside eating an apple, and when I threw the core onto the compost pile, I could hear a voice that said 'thank you' in a whisper, as if the voice of someone far away on the wind. That was the only manifestation I ever had there that happened outdoors rather than inside the house, and it was the last one there. We moved out shortly thereafter, though it had nothing to do with the ghosts - nobody else in my family would admit to having any experiences there.

When I was still telling the same stories years later and I suppose they decided I wasn't just imagining things, my mother and the other women in my extended family finally admitted that they'd felt scared and uneasy in that basement, especially in the areas I heard voices or in the area around the pantry door. None of the men or boys ever felt it, and my younger brother had no idea what was happening to me there. About two years after moving out, my fear of fire, which had nearly been a phobia and only started declining when we moved out of that house, finally went away almost completely, and I never wet the bed again.

To this day, I wonder what happened in that place to make it the way it was, though I know I kept asking my mother about the woman who lived there before us and whether her husband had died in the house. She said that she didn't think that woman, an elderly lady, ever had a husband. I would love to know what happened in that house, but I'm not even sure how to go about doing research on it, since it happened over a decade ago. Fortunately, since then, my ghostly encounters have been a whole lot more benign and some actually pleasant, though I haven't heard a ghost speak since that house

Townhouse Apartment,Philippines,Apparitions / Voices / Touches,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Apparitions / Voices / Touches :: Townhouse Apartment

I used to live for 6 years in a compound, a townhouse type apartment with one big fence/gate, big water tank and parking area that the tenants share. I know everybody because it only has 8 doors (A to H) . We use to celebrate holidays at the parking area bringing out the food and music to party every year. That place is what I used to call home.

But sometimes we get disturbed by unexplainable things. One night at around 11pm I heard my elder sister shouting my name, I immediately stop what I'm doing (playing PlayStation) and run upstairs to check. I turned on the light and found her sitting on her bed. She gave me a sign to stay quiet and listen, pointing her finger to the cabinet in front of her. I'm very clueless about what she wants to tell me so I opened the cabinet and saw nothing but her clothes. She then asked me if I heard something, ""No I heard nothing"". She said when she's about to sleep she heard a soft but long ""PSSSSSSST"" like someone is calling her. She ignored it thinking that was just nothing but it keeps on going so she listened and to her shocked when she follows the sound she said it's coming from her cabinet. I thought maybe it's just her imagination until it happened again.

Her best friend came to visit and planned to stay for two nights. She likes trying out clothes of my sister because they share everything together , we already considered her part of the family, hence she can do whatever she wants in the house. She was all alone in my sister's room (my sister was taking a shower) while I was playing again downstairs when I heard her shout. She came down to me as fast as she could. I asked her what is happening to you? Then she told me the story. She was checking out my sister's collections of accessories when she heard a very soft but long ""PSSSSSST"" She looked behind her and nobody is with her in the room .She continues with the accessories then she heard it again, on the third time she followed the sound and found out that it was coming out of the cabinet. She thought that is so impossible so she opened it and convinced herself that she is just crazy when to her shocked she heard it again louder like it was already beside her, that's when she decided to run down to me. My sister and I gave the same looked to her because we never told her the same incident since we know she will be scared. We don't let the cabinet stay open and we keep it totally shut/closed ever since.

I like playing RPG games on the playstation. I'm always playing and trying to finish it while these things happened. One time I choose to stay home rather than go out with my sister to the mall. She called to say that she will be staying the night with her best friend. I thought COOL no disturbance (our parents are always abroad, a maid comes every morning and leave at the evening). I didn't notice that I was already playing until 2am when something happened behind me. At my back is where the dining area is, beside the kitchen and the toilet. I wasn't aware of anything until I heard someone or something is having a cup of coffee, it sounds like stirring the coffee and making a noise of spoon on the mug but when I turned around, nothing. That was weird I thought but didn't bother and continued with my game.

Then I heard the door of the toilet moved as if there is someone who's going to use it, I turned around, still nothing unusual. I continue with my game again ,then  I heard someone banging on the wall. It sounded like when you want to communicate with the other room, you just make noises on the wall. So I checked the time and saw that it's already 2 am, my neighbors on the other apartment are surely fast asleep because they leave early in the morning because they have 2 children who go to school. I decided that's enough, time to rest I'm getting crazy I need sleep. In the morning I asked the neighbor about it, they said they can hear the same noises at night and they thought it was me putting a frame or poster on the wall. They even said that sometime they already want to complain because it's frequently happening. I was surprised because my sister and I weren't doing anything on the wall recently.

Another night alone while I was playing my favorite game, I heard the ""PSSSSST"" sound of a person but I cannot identify the gender because it's a soft voice like teasing me. I was wondering who it might be since the sound is coming out of the window and it's from the outside. Hearing that 3 times I went out to check if one of my friend is messing with me but I saw no one, no footsteps, no giggles, no sign of anything at all, and the parking lot was totally empty.

I felt a little nervous while sat back in front of my game, I remember the experiences of my sister and her friend but I wanted to make sure that this is not hallucination. I tried to listen and follow the sound, it was really from the outside of the window. It feels like the person doing this was very near because I can really hear it, for the last time I went out to check. I sat in front of the door and waited. I waited for 20 minutes for the sound and for whoever was making it but there's nothing again, no one came out of hiding (if it's my friend or cousin). I just turned up the music of my game so that I cannot hear anything from the outside anymore. It's so weird.

That's just some things on our apartment I will write everything in the next part. Thank you for reading, feel free to tell me answers...

Strange Sexual Experience With Spirit Being,"Wisconsin, United States",Succubus / Incubus / Sexual Ghosts,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Succubus / Incubus / Sexual Ghosts :: Strange Sexual Experience With Spirit Being

I had an experience with a strange spirit December 28th, 2005. I will never forget it. I used to get up early because my husband had to be to work by 6am. So we would get up at 4am and I would make his breakfast, lunch and send him off.

At the time I was having a really hard time with our religious beliefs of 30 years and after he would go to work I would get online and study. Well this morning I had gone back to bed at 5:30 and fell asleep. At around 7am I looked at the clock and could hear the kids starting to get up and chat in the living room. Suddenly, I had my eyes closed and I felt a strong electric tingly feeling in my abdomen.

I was lying on my right side with my legs bent and literally felt my abdomen pull forward a little. It was a powerful magnetic feeling. I kept my eyes closed because I kind of knew what this was. I had fantasized from the time I was a young teen about having an invisible lover.

This thing rolled me onto my back and I felt like I was floating. It pulled my legs apart and started having sexual intercourse with me and I was dressed! It moved through me from head to toe but the sex was out of this world. It was golden in color and talked to me through my thoughts. It was weird! It was very serious.

I notice that his tongue was very long and lizard like. The whole being was golden.

It literally put me in mind of that Academy Award trophy except with facial features. The only thing I can say is that when it was done and I got up, I thought to myself ""Why would God do that?"" I felt that it was from God at the time. I was tired for days afterward and it was all I could think about. I wanted it to come back and finish what it had started but it never has.

Well, if anyone would like to discuss this feel free to email me. I would love to talk about it. I had never really heard of these things until that happened to me. I thought what I thought about as a teen was my own imagination. After this happened, however... I started looking online out of curiosity and was shocked to find out it was not a new thing! Any idea why they come and or go? What made it show up that day and not 1000 others years ago?

Thoughtforms And Spirits Who Act For Others,United Kingdom,Psychic / Medium,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Psychic / Medium :: Thoughtforms And Spirits Who Act For Others

I mentioned in my other story Sinister Presence During my Childhood that I had a bad time at the age of 18 and for a few years after that. I was depressed, lonely and prone to self harm due to many different factors including a longterm relationship which had just broken up and difficulties with my parents. The longterm relationship was with Fran, my friend that I mentioned in my other story He Saw His Father Leave His Body. Fran and I were very psychically connected and even after our relationship finished, we had a lot of trouble dropping the psychic communication. Whenever I cried and cut myself, Fran would hear me screaming in his head. No joke. It took 18 months for this to stop happening and for us both to break the ties. At this time, I was experiencing these distracting psychic problems and I was still at school but getting behind in my work because of my state of mind. Over the easter holidays my parents employed a tutor to coach me for my exams because they felt that I wouldn't get the marks I needed if I didn't have extra help.

Mr Jones, my tutor, was an extremely overweight middle-aged man who lived with his mother a few villages away from our house. All his life he had been a teacher but had been allowed to retire due to ill-health. He had never been married or had a girlfriend, he told me, because he had been morbidly obese his whole life. He appeared to have no social life apart from his mother, and a lot of time on his hands. He said he had loved women from a distance but they often found him too disgusting to have a relationship with him. He had bad diabetes and he couldn't stand up for very long before he had to sit or lie down. So our lessons were rather informal, to say the least. Being as lonely as I was I gradually began to warm to someone who accepted me for being myself, and somebody who had experienced loneliness too. He said he didn't care about my grades and he just wanted me to be happy again. Looking back now all I can see is a man who used my emotional vulnerability to get inside my head and refuse to leave, but at the time I thought I'd met someone who believed in me.

Mr Jones used to take me through several ""relaxation exercises"" where I would lie on the floor during our breaks from studying. Most of them were the usual ones you hear of - picturing countryside scenes, birds twittering, wind blowing etc, but during one of the exercises I recall, he got me to visualize and speak to a person he described to me in such acute detail I could see the person in my head. It was a small, humorous, hobbit-like dwarf man. In my head it was just a sketch like one of the dwarves from Snow White, but it came so easily to my mind. He told me that this ""person"" would be my counsellor and confidante and I could tell this ""person"" all my secrets. At the time I was in awe of how he managed to project this image into my head that I believed him and thought it must be some kind of counselling technique, and Mr Jones, although old and fat and still living with his mother, must have developed some sort of meditation skill out of his solitude. The dwarf exercise became an ongoing thing we'd do during our breaks every session. I would tell the dwarf how I was feeling while visualizing him (I never actually felt him there) and Mr Jones would do a guided meditation with me to get me into that state.

This was all fine until I went back to school and my tutoring ended. On our last day together he asked if he could take some pictures of me with his mother in their front room. I agreed of course, thankful to him for helping me through some of the bad times and I promised to keep in touch. I imagined ""keeping in touch"" meant I would send him my exam results when they came through and a thank you letter. This is not what happened. While back at school I started receiving persistent emails and phonecalls from Mr Jones insisting that I speak to him and that I wasn't being a ""good enough friend"" after everything he had done for me. This progressed to him emailing about five times a day, mostly during the early morning hours 2,3 and 4am and calling my house and my mobile about twice a day after school. When my parents picked up he told them he had something urgent to tell me about my tutoring and that I was ignoring his advice and that I didn't want to do well in my exams, which made them angry with me. When they passed the phone to me, ordering me to speak to him, he often told me nonsense about what he'd been doing that day, and reprimanded me for not returning his calls and emails. In most of the emails he told me that he wanted to know what I was thinking and feeling at every moment of the day, and that he was depressed and thinking about killing himself and only I could help him.

In the back of my mind I could see what was happening, but I was so young and naive and embarrassed my idealized ""tutor/tutee"" friendship had come to this, I didn't think about telling anyone. Compilation CDs started arriving from him through the post with songs dedicated to me, and a paragraph about each song detailing why he thought it was relevant to him and I. One of the songs was Elvis Presley ""Suspicious Minds"" which he said described how we couldn't ""go on like this, denying our feelings about each other and arguing all the time..."" He sent me copies of the photos he had taken of myself and his mother and the ones of him and I, along with a letter about how special our time spent together had been. Days later, he left three crying messages on my mobile answerphone in the middle of the night saying he was going to kill himself. I felt awful, of course, and tortured myself for thinking I had caused him to do this by not responding to him. I also felt I had been ungrateful for his help.

As I was undressing one night to take a bath, the first of many nights to come like this, the room became cold and I suddenly felt the dwarf he had made me visualize standing in the room, watching me. It was no longer the friendly, fun-loving creature he had described to me - I felt like it was here on a mission. I don't see the physical qualities of spirits definitively, but I see shadows and I can tell exactly where they are in the room and estimate their size and shape. This shadow dwarf ""thing"" was about three feet high and moving hesitantly closer as if it was ""sneaking around..."" I got a strong sense that it didn't know I had sensed its presence, that it wasn't necessarily conscious in itself, but something was driving it. Like a robot or a remote control car. I covered up immediately and left the room. The presence, of course, made me think of Mr Jones. I checked my email to find the usual messages from him, and immediately felt the presence of the dwarf again behind me. I moved through each room of the house and after I had been there for several minutes, I could feel the presence again and again. During the day, when Mr Jones was obviously tutoring other students, I felt nothing. But at night, when I knew he had nothing else to do, I felt like he had a CCTV camera into my life and was watching me through this thing, this whatever-it-was.

I know it's very easy to gather from this story that it was purely psychological manipulation on Mr Jones' part, but my psychic sense is strong, and this fact has been confirmed to me many, many times. The hauntings from this dwarf only stopped when I eventually told the authorities and my parents about Mr Jones' behaviour and he was cautioned and told to remove all pictures of me from his house. I feel like the less stuff he had of mine, the less he was able to access me. I've heard of throughtforms before, but I'm not totally sure what they are. I'm looking for someone to help me understand what he might have done, psychically? And how I might be able to prevent it happening again in the future? Apologies if the ""frightening"" part of this story isn't long enough, but I'll be happy to talk about it more in discussion.

The Sinister Presence,"Arkansas, United States",Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: The Sinister Presence

I have never been one to take much notice of the supernatural. I do believe in God and I know I'm somewhat protected from spirits by being saved by Christ. Still, there are times when there are other dangers than those involving your soul. I've lived in my house for many years and for the most part nothing too interesting has happened. Occasionally I'll get a feeling that disturbs me to the pit of my soul.

I have yet to lay eyes on whatever occasionally frequents my home but I can always feel it; watching, and waiting. When it is around you can feel a sense of anticipation as though something were waiting for someone or something to happen. Occasionally at night when no one is around aside from me it would make its presence known. I would be sitting watching television or reading when suddenly I would get a cold sinking feeling. The feeling would start in the center of my chest and sink lower; it is always accompanied with a sense of dread. A sense of fear that was impossible to ignore it makes you just want to run.

Whenever I feel this the cats are around they will suddenly sit up and begin to stare at a particular corner of the room intently. At night it becomes stronger and sometimes I will get the feeling and when I do I usually have to clutch my Bible to my chest just to keep me calm. It sometimes walks up the hall. The floor in the hallway is water damaged and when someone walks down the hall you can hear it. So far it has eluded my sight but eventually I'm sure I will see it I just hope I'm prepared for what I see.

Scared... Teen,"New Jersey, United States",Apparitions / Voices / Touches,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Apparitions / Voices / Touches :: Scared... Teen

I am a fourteen year old teen and I live with my father and his girl friend. My dad and I have been moving around a lot and rented cheap old houses and my dad finally saved up enough money to live in a decent home.

Throughout my moving I have seen pretty weird things and I didn't want my dad to think less of me because I see weird things. Also my dad and I rarely talk so...

When I moved into my new and current home I made some friends and this is when my dad found his girl friend. I have lived in this house for 3 years to be exact and I thought that my shadow seeing and things falling off was over until last year.

I could still picture it in my mind.  I was in my living room and my dad and his girlfriend was out for the week or two. During that time I started to see strange things again and I felt scared that I had to turn on the light and sleep as much as I hated it, because of the increasing electricity bill. I was planning to sleep with the lights off and be brave.

So, I turned off my lights when I went to bed. Around midnight to 2 o' clock I woke up because I was thirsty and when I entered my kitchen I turned on my light, opened the fridge, got out a bottle of water and drank. While I was drinking I heard some noises as if someone was washing the clothes old style with the board and stuff. So I followed the noise and it became louder but not much. The noise came from my bathroom and I looked around but nothing was there. I tried to deny everything I heard and I went back to sleep.

I heard it again and this is the point where I felt scared the turned on the lights and it became cold and I heard some noises coming from the upstairs room like running.

I didn't have any roommates so I went into my kitchen and got out a knife thinking that it was some robber. I slowly went up stairs and I tried to be silent as possible and I heard a door close at the far end of the room.

I went and checked and it seemed  as if someone was hiding in the corner. I felt really scared, turned on the lights and she was gone so I hurried downstairs dropping the knife, turned on the living room lights and turned on the T.V. But the T.V. didn't work so I just sat there and fell asleep on the couch.

I woke up in the morning, didn't go to school and my dad called wondering why I lied that I felt really sick and about to throw up. He didn't believe it but he told me to stay home.

Who Came Home With You?,"Pennsylvania, United States",Apparitions / Voices / Touches,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Apparitions / Voices / Touches :: Who Came Home With You?

I have several stories to share and I will start with the first I remember being told about. This took place when I was about five years old. I'm not sure if it would be considered supernatural or not.

My mother had gone to our neighbor's house,who lived about one hundred yards up the lane from our house, for some chit-chat. It was dark when she decided to come back home. She said while she was walking, she felt like someone was following her, but when she would turn around the only thing behind her were two light reflections that seemed to be ten feet behind her.

She told herself that it had to be the reflection from the neighbor's house and described them as bouncing balls of light. When she made it half way to the house she turned around and they were still there and still ten feet behind her. She started walking a little faster.

When she made it to the top of our yard, she thought to herself ""when I turn into the yard the light won't be able to turn"". She turned into the yard and was feeling silly for thinking she was being followed by balls of light. It was about fifty feet from the top of the yard to the house. When she got about half way she turned around and there were the lights so she ran the rest of the way and locked the door behind her.

This is where I come in. My mother told me that about five minutes after coming home, I come out of my room crying asking who the two people were that came home with her because they were on the porch waiving at me and they had really scary faces.

I don't remember this happening but I also don't know why my mother would tell me a story like that. She has since passed away so I hope I remember everything the way she told me. Just so everyone knows I wasn't told this story until I was eight or nine when I started having other things happen to me.

Something In The Back Room,"New Mexico, United States",Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: Something In The Back Room

T his happened when I was about 5 or 6. It happened in the back room of our old house. We used to use that room for storage, and it was partly my dads little gym. We used to move around a lot when I was younger, and this was the first house I lived in, and grew up in. There were very many weird things that would happen in that house. We've always linked it back to my grandfather.

A little bit about him, he is a Native American medicine man. He constantly has things following him. It would never come past that back room though. He did have a lot of his ceremonial things back there.

There was also something else in the garage; I used to refuse to walk in there alone because it had always felt like something was watching you. It was just too uncomfortable. There was one other room also, the living room, but in there it wasn't an uncomfortable, unwanted feeling. It was more of a, there's something in there, but it's not here to harm you feeling.

However, the back room was the worst. I refused to walk past the sliding glass door at night; it always felt like someone was watching you. I also refused to look outside because of the feeling I got.

The only times I went out there was when my grandfather was out there because whatever it was must of been afraid of him.

I was playing with my toys like usual by my dads little gym. I hadn't noticed my grandfather go back into his room, and I started to get that weird feeling. I had noticed though that everyone was in the dining room so I thought nothing of it and continued to play. I remember I looked over to see if my grandfather was still sitting there because I heard some papers and boxes being moved, and I saw nothing. It happened a few times and I was pretty freaked out by now.

About the fifth time I looked over there, there was a big black shape, and I had screamed. I don't remember very much else of it, but it had started to come near me. Before it even got half way through the room my dad had rushed out to see if I was okay. The black shape had just disappeared. After that, I never went back out there.

We used to have a dog named Bear, and he did growl many times at that room.

Anytime he went through there he would run through, and into the backyard. And every time I passed that room after that, I ran across. I would never go past it at night, or if no one was home.

I do know that there were a couple more strange happenings at this house too. Before we moved in, my mom had seen a baby stroller, and had asked about it, but when she had shown the owner what she was talking about, the stroller had vanished. A couple years later after my grandmother died, my dad had heard cabinets opening and closing, and figured it was one of my older sisters. When he walked out there, a few cabinets would be opened, and he'd check on my sisters and they'd be sound asleep.

That is what I remember in that house. Ever since we moved out though, I don't feel the need to be scared to walk past doors that don't have blinds on them, and I'm not afraid to be alone anywhere. Maybe it just stayed there? Because anytime we pass that house I still get that creepy feeling, or maybe it's just my subconscious replaying old memories.

The Ghost That Carries The Lantern,"Alabama, United States",Orbs / Lights / Mists,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Orbs / Lights / Mists :: The Ghost That Carries The Lantern

I 'm in this band, and we thought that it was about time to take some band photos. So, we go up to my driveway and we're standing under this large street light hanging over the top part of my driveway.

I set up the camera on the tripod, and we were going to stand at this fence we have up there surrounding our junkyard which was down like a small cliff, maybe about ten feet down. Well, we have our junkyard there, and down below it is a valley which is full of woods and stuff. We have this path that runs through it.

Heather, our singer said she was seeing something in the path down there; it was dark out, by the way.  Then our lead guitarist Sean said ""You see it too?""  I thought it was just a street light off in the distance. So I walk over and look at it and it looked like someone was standing in the path with a lantern but it kept going off and coming back on. Then it slowly started to move.

So we watched it, and Sean and I take Heather to the house and tell her to stay there. We grabbed flashlights and knives, because we didn't know if it was someone out there who was crazy or something.  We go out into the path. We start walking and it's starting to come up a storm. We're standing there, surrounded by the woods, and in the silence, I call out. ""Hello?"" As soon as I finished saying this, lightning filled the sky. Sean joked and said he had seen too many horror movies to know that this was a stupid idea. So, we continued on down the path throughout the woods, and we ended up where we had seen this lantern type thing earlier, but it was gone. That's when we heard heavy footsteps running through the woods. We followed them out of the trail, but we didn't find anything.

Down near the bottom of this large hill I live on, is this old trailer deep in the woods no one has lived in for years, so we thought if anything was out there, it probably made a run for that trailer, so we went out that way and crossed over the barbed wire fence.

We were about to head towards the trailer, but then we saw the lantern shape thing again. And it was moving. We followed it for a little but it went away again. So we stopped. I turned back to look at Sean. He was looking down at the ground and said he thought he heard something hit the ground beside him, so we both look up.

Through a few trees we see the floating orange ball of light that looked like it was inside a lantern floating there, five feet away form us. Now, my grandfather works for the mines, so I had a high powered mining light, and I shined it over there, but there was nothing holding it up. It was just this orange glowing light hovering in the air.

It got brighter and then faded out once more only to reappear farther away from us.

There was no way something could have run from us as far as this thing got without making a sound. We wanted to keep chasing it, but we were coming upon a part of the woods where we had seen a lot of snakes in the past so we decided to just get out of there.

So, we walked back up to the spot where we were taking pictures to see if we could see it from up there again, but we couldn't. It was then when we noticed it hovering over in my backyard, it faded out again, and then quickly shot back off down the hill.

It was very exciting coming so close to this ball of light that looked like it was in a lantern. And I found out they used to mine for coal under my junkyard, and there were a fair number of deaths down there, so I'm wondering if that had anything to do with it.

Strange Things That Happen On Hoodoo Mountain,"Idaho, United States",Non Human Entities,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Non Human Entities :: Strange Things That Happen On Hoodoo Mountain

T his is a story that happened to my brother and me about 16 years ago. We lived at the feet of Hoodoo Mountain in northern Idaho. We did a lot of hunting so on any particular day during hunting season, when we returned from school, we would grab our rifles and head up the mountain on foot to see what we could find.

On this particular trip things just felt a little different. Neither my brother nor I could place it so we just went on. We were known to stay out after dark on some of these trips so no one would be looking for us until around dinner. Well, we set off and were getting pretty far away, and before we knew it, it was dark and therefore time to head home, so we turned around and headed back, or so we thought.

Now let me explain about Hoodoo Mountain for those of you who have never been in that area. It is known for people to head up there and commit suicide for no apparent reason. There have been many ""unexplained"" deaths on this mountain as well as ""lost"" hunters all the time. There was an old cabin on it nearly 100 years ago but it burned down with a woman and child inside (I have seen them both but that is another story.), and to top it off the Native Americans in that area are the ones that named it and roughly the name translates to evil spirit, and they were known to avoid the area when passing.

Back to my story, my brother and I had turned around and were headed home, we knew our direction, because we had done it a thousand times before, we just turned to where the moon was rising and walked that way. From where we were it would be rising right above our house.

We were walking downhill- at least we thought we were. We had been walking awhile and it was kind of weird to us that we hadn't come across the road that ran up the mountain but we thought nothing of it because everything else looked right so we kept walking. We went on for like 30-45 minutes and we should have hit the road by then but we hadn't.

About this time I heard a wolf howl and I recognized it as my pet that was tied up in front of the house, but it was coming from the wrong direction and farther away than it should have been, it was coming from behind us. Now I know he was securely tied up and couldn't get free, so my brother and I looked at each other and exchanged "" What the heck's"", then started to head towards the howl. At this point I began calling his name, and he would howl in return, in this way we used that to guide us home.

This doesn't sound like more than a couple of kids getting lost, and spooked up to this point, but the part that makes this weird is that we KNEW that area like the back of our hands, and everything had changed to make us feel like we were heading down that mountain not up like we were supposed to. The make up of the terrain, even the moon appeared in the wrong place.

We later went back up there to try and explain it away and found out that where we had turned around was right where that cabin had stood so many years ago.

It is my firm belief that had my wolf not called to me when he did, we would have been added to the spirits of that mountain.

Candle X-ray,Oman,Apparitions / Voices / Touches,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Apparitions / Voices / Touches :: Candle X-ray

T his experience happened way back in 1994-1996 at the Sultanate of Oman. Me and my friend, Kate, were around 33-34 years old. This is only a part of my encounter with ghostly entities.

The Sultanate of Oman is a beautiful country, it's clean, organized and most of the locals are friendly. There are a lot of beautiful places that are over-looking the city. Most of its mountains (Muscat) are of rock in nature. The ruler is a very good one. He loves everyone including the expatriates.

Me and my best friend, Kate, just got locally hired at the Sultanate and since we are very good friends, we were given a furnished Studio Flat to share with, the building of which is just beside our offices. Both Kate and I are Catholics and we believe in ghost and other paranormal phenomena. Though we started to become friends in college, we never run out of stories (based on true experiences) to share.

In the Philippines (our home country), when someone gets bewitched or a curse has been put due to grudge by another person and performed by a black witch, we usually take the person to a white witch doctor especially if the medicine that we have at home doesn't affect the person  at all. So the white witch doctor will usually perform Candle X-ray (or the local term is ""Tawas""). The ritual has prayer on it and God knows; only the white witch doctor recites that. If the sickness which struck the person is man-made and/or was possessed by a ghost or elementals, then an image will be shown on the melted candle wax that spreads on the water.

One day Kate and I decided to do the Candle X-ray, as it was being done in our country. Though we didn't know the prayer we proceeded with our experiment. So Kate asked me to do it since I am braver than her so I agreed. For us, it was just for fun. We wanted to know whether there will be images to show from the ritual. We said our own prayers too before we did the ritual.

After that night, things started to be weird for the two of us. We started to hear strange noises especially in the night coming from the ceiling. Whenever we check our building mate (our officemate) upstairs whether she started to clean her flat at 2:00 in the morning, she will say that she never stays up that late especially on weekdays. One night we were praying the Holy Rosary, we were seated in my bed, Kate was behind me, and I sensed that she was reckless.

After our prayer, she didn't wait for me to ask her what's happening, she said that she got scared, she saw grey smoke coming out from my body, I too got scared and started to cry because what if that's a sign that my health is deteriorating... I had a lot of ""what ifs""...That passed.

One day, I was washing clothes, Kate was watching TV, I went beside her just to look what she was watching then suddenly I was pushed violently, and I almost fell on Kate. Nobody was there behind me, only the two of us were in the flat. There were times that I would see Kate passing behind me and even waving her hand and smiling at me while I was brushing my teeth (because there's a sink with mirror in the hall that is between the kitchen and 1-1/2 baths) and when I enter the bedroom, Kate would be  asleep and heavily snoring, wearing different clothes.

Also one time, that was around 5:30pm, a Friday, we were about to go to the store to buy something. Kate was ahead of me down the stairs and I was the one who closed/locked the door. On the other stairs from upstairs, I saw one lady coming down, but only noticed her skirt-It was pleated and printed, yellow green. Her shoes were white with a ribbon around the ankles. In short, she was like somebody from the '50's.

Suddenly I realized, nobody dresses like that in our building (girls' side) as we are all Filipinas, so then I told Kate, we got company. She said ""hurry up and run!"" (While typing this, the left part of my head is having goose bumps)...

There was a time, one night we came from a big grocery (Al Fair) in Wadi Kabir. We had to walk home because of the short distance, each carrying grocery bags. We passed by the big roundabout (full of flowers)...I noticed, I'd been smelling a perfume called ""tea rose"", I don't like that perfume (no offence intended for those of you who like Tea Rose) because it smells like funeral flowers.

Then, by the time we were almost near our building, the scent was still in my nose, I asked Kate ""why do you also smell like Tea Rose?"" I felt as if it had attached itself on me when we passed by the roundabout.

She said she felt it too so we began running then when we reached our door (our Flat) and opened it, the cassette radio was playing (we remembered switching it off before we went out). It was playing one of Michael Jackson's songs, ""somebody's watching you"".

Suddenly the damaged alarm clock (which was just kept there even it was not working for 3 days) suddenly rung continuously. Kate got it and removed the batteries and threw it outside the window, and we saw/heard it was still ringing... We both freaked out!

On another occasion, me and Kate had an argument over something that was not that important so she asked my 2 sisters, my elder sister and 2 of her lady friends (as witnesses) to meet at her house. My elder sister was sitting in the big couch with her friend. There was an empty space between them. My other friends and my sister sat on other couches. I was sitting on the dining chair, alone because we were having bully session and I was the ""star"" of it...

While my elder sister was talking, I noticed there was someone sitting in the middle of them where the small space was (well only a baby can sit in-between them). I tried to check whether that was my shadow (so I moved several times) but it was a solid shadow and it wasn't moving.  My elder sister noticed me and asked me what was wrong.

I told her that there's somebody sitting in between them, a lady, I couldn't see the face because it was solid black and it was not moving at all. It's like it fitted itself in between them. After that, my sister freaked out and she ended the bully session and said that she'll  spend the night with us in my younger sister's house... In short, she really got too scared... I didn't mean to scare anybody, in fact, I didn't mean to say anything but they asked me.

There are a lot of paranormal experiences that happened but to make it short, I had a  nervous breakdown then one of our friends took me to the Priest to be blessed. Our flat was blessed too but ghosts / shadow people still continued. We spent our weekend at my sister's flat then weekdays on our haunted flat but the strange events continued  until the day I left Oman in September 1996.

Perhaps the entities that we encountered in that flat were mischievous, earthbound ones and some demons too because before I had a nervous breakdown, the wall on the middle hall started to peel off its paint (day by day) and it formed the face of a devil.

The moral lesson of the story, never try something for fun without knowing anything and not being entitled to do it... It can be a way to open the wrong portals to the other dimensions.

A Spirit Came Home From The Cemetery With Me,"Ohio, United States",Ghost Hunting,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Ghost Hunting :: A Spirit Came Home From The Cemetery With Me

T his is just a quick story. I am a 38 year old male, 6 years in the Army and I think I am pretty grounded. As you may be able to tell by my name, I have done a lot of field research on EVPs (Electronic Voice Phenomena).

EVPs are voices found on a recording device that were not there when initially recorded. This is just a hobby of mine and my family (Wife 37, Son 14, Daughter 10, and Infant boy). We go to cemeteries and talk to the ""Spirits"" out loud. Some times you get a response, sometimes you don't.

This particular event happened last year after one of our research sessions. We went to an old Lutheran Cemetery. I found an area of about 25 graves from the mid 1800's that were written in German. I can speak German, so I asked them to talk in the Digital Recorder and I would be able to hear them later.

Shortly afterwards, we left the Cemetery and excitedly went home to review our Evidence. After checking the evidence, we found nothing out of the ordinary Sometimes you get them... Sometimes you don't).

About a week after this, we (family) were sitting at our kitchen table just talking about nothing in particular. All of a sudden my infants ""Talking Pizza Elmo"" went off in the next room (living room). It sings and dances a bit when the button is pressed. We all looked at each other and kind of giggled. We just thought it was low batteries, parametric pressure...etc.

It went off again after a few minutes and again a few minutes after that. (By the way, it had brand new batteries in the toy.) The third time it went off, I grabbed my digital recorder and stood about 2 feet over the singing Elmo. It went off several more time and I stopped recording. My family stood very quietly in the kitchen as I recorded.

They record as well so they know the drill. Please listen to the attached audio file. You will hear Elmo singing, then a man laughing (at me by the way). Speaking with   a german accent, he said ""always recording. That's so Fragile, isn't it"".

He thought I was funny to jump up and record him. Anyway, I hope you enjoyed this. I have a bunch of EVPs and stories. I was never a believer in ghosts until we moved into a little house in town but that is another story.

Note: this story is real. We have recorded EVPs in our Van after leaving a cemetery on many occasions. Let me know if you folks would like to hear more. I like to get these out so that people know they are not crazy... Heck, I HEAR dead people...

The Lady In Pink,"Michigan, United States",Apparitions / Voices / Touches,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Apparitions / Voices / Touches :: The Lady In Pink

W hen I was four, my parents took myself and our little Shitzu, Mickey, to a cabin up north to stay with my aunt and uncle. I didn't particularly care for the cabin, as it was infested with many spiders and beetles. It wasn't clean. It was small. I was fairly high maintenance, even at the age of four.

One night, while the ""grown-ups"" sat in the living room talking politics and gossiping, I apparently fell asleep. I woke up very early in the morning, possibly just a couple of hours past midnight, to find that I was sharing a very large bed with my Uncle Ed. My aunt wasn't there, but I assumed that I was carried into the room after falling asleep on the couch. However, when I turned my head back towards the clock, I noticed that a very tall woman was standing in the doorway. She was wearing pink pajamas. At first I thought that she might be my aunt so I asked her if she wanted her bed back, but I received no response. Upon closer inspection, I noticed that the woman didn't really look anything like my aunt. Though it was dark, the very outline of this woman's body was drastically different from hers.

I spent another few seconds trying to see who it was. My second guess was that it was my mother. She had similar pajamas, but my mom was also very short- five feet, two inches. I called out to her anyway, but again, no response, and the woman simply stood there. I was only four at the time- I didn't know anything about ghosts. The woman in the doorway vanished.

The next morning, I crawled out of bed with blankie in hand and walked into the kitchen. I asked my mom why she came into my room the night before, but she stated quite passively that she had not. My aunt looked a bit puzzled when I asked her as well. Being that they were the only women in the house, I dropped it.

Just Checking In,"Michigan, United States",Family / Friends Visits,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Family / Friends Visits :: Just Checking In

B oth my parents worked full-time, which left me and our two dogs, Mickey and Fritz, to fend for ourselves. It was my last summer vacation before I would begin high school, and I had marching band rehearsal every Monday and Wednesday from 5:00 p.m. to 9:00 p.m. My best friend and her mom would pick me up at around 4:30 to take us to the practice field. My mom bought me Healthy Choice TV Dinners to make before I left.

One day, in late August, just three months or so after the death or my Uncle Al, I had just sat down with my TV dinner (turkey and stuffing was always my favorite).

As soon as I had started to pick at my Turkey I heard scuffling noises. I heard someone walk across the basement floor. I heard someone begin to ascend the stairs.

My only thoughts revolved around intruders in black face masks with guns. I wasn't sure what to do. I had locked the doors. Nothing unusual happened that day. I didn't notice anyone break in. We had windows in our basement but I couldn't even fit through those- and I only weighed 98 pounds.

However, the footsteps continued. Mickey and Fritz didn't bark, however, but simply stared at the landing. Suddenly, the footsteps stopped as if someone had just come to a halt beside the kitchen counter, and I heard a soft thump as if someone was leaning against it watching me. The room was suddenly filled with the aroma of pipe tobacco.

Ghosts In Garron Tower,Ireland,Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: Ghosts In Garron Tower

T his experience is very recent and most details of the spirit's appearances were unfamiliar to me, making description difficult.

I have not been able to narrate any of my gripping tails of paranormal adventure in a long while because of the awful reality of end of year exams in my school. I mention this because my school is rather notorious for its many hauntings and history.

I attend Garron Tower which is situated outside Carnlough on the Coast Road on the way to Larne. The building is a large mansion built in the style of a typical medieval castle, which had come back into fashion in the late 1800s. The owner of the castle was the Marchioness of Londonderry; Francis Anne Vane.

When she died, it was then passed on to her son who had no love for the building and neglected it, at the event of his death it was passed on to Vane's grandson; Winston Churchill. Being the Prime Minister, he had no time for the castle so it was donated to the British Tourist Industry which transformed it into a hotel; it was then devastated by fire and was later turned into a school which it still is today.

In its long history many tragic deaths have occurred including students who threw themselves off the high cliffs over the sea which the castle overlooks.

I am a student attending the school and this was the week of the end of term examinations. Our exam centre was situated in the 'old castle' as it is named now since there are modern school buildings attached to the original structure.

I was presently seated, furiously attempting an English examination on the 9th June at approximately eleven o'clock when the oddest thing occurred. A strange hovering globe appeared over the shoulder of one of the teachers and presently moved at apparently random motions around the room. I was astounded that only I could see it. It approached me three times about five paces from me. I did not reach out to touch it for fear of looking the fool and being disqualified from the exam. It went through all the possibilities in my head of what it could be, I ruled out the possibility of a watch reflection since the light was spherical and not confined to a wall. After the exam had concluded, we left and I saw no more of it.

At lunch time of the 14th June I was sitting with my two friends in the old garden of the castle when a woman walked with an odd spring to her step. She was wearing odd clothes, a white gown like thing with a strange bonnet and all manner of strange old fashioned garments. She walked straight through a group of boys, who did not see her but looked over their shoulders at something they felt but did not see. She too vanished as she neared us.

I researched any sightings of white woman ghosts in Garron Tower but found none but I was sure I saw one.

The final spectre which calls my school his home is a well known figure, commonly known as the 'Black Butler' since his surname was Black and his occupation was butler to the patrons of Garron Tower Hotel in the early 1900s. When the fire started, he was confined to his tower quarters and he was forced to jump out the window for his life. He later died of his injuries from the fall. (There are many variations of this story; nobody is quite certain if that is how or where he died).

I was doing a Geography exam, since it was such a small class they sent us to the drawing room'. An outstandingly beautiful place and a well know hangout of our subject spirit. I began the exam and the typical, exam time hush ensued. I was concentrating to the best of my ability when something caught my eye, moving in the corner of a room.

A man dressed in an old fashioned tuxedo was sitting cross legged on the chair. His figure was blurred and distorted but he stayed there for around five minutes (of which I stared at him) until his form faded into nothingness. When his form appeared a strange cold crashed through the room (it was a very hot summer day), it made the other students and teachers look around, that is why the form vanished.

I concluded from the style of clothing that it was the Black Butler.

It was a very rare treat to view these things because we are not normally permitted to enter the old castle and its gardens in case someone vandalises them. It was visit well worth paying.

Dark Figure,"Ohio, United States",Apparitions / Voices / Touches,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Apparitions / Voices / Touches :: Dark Figure

H ere's a story that I hope people might be able to help me figure out concerning the thing that was in my room last night.

I was sleeping downstairs with my dog since it was storming and he gets scared. So I kept the baby monitor on so I could listen for Logan, my little baby brother. I heard him crying so I went upstairs to check on him.

I have the room that's in the middle and you can see into it when you first walk up.

So I looked in my room and I saw something walk from my door into my closet. I was so scared, but I still went to check on Logan. Copper ran into my room and lay   down by my closet which was open. I had it closed and it was now wide open. I turned on my light to see if there was something in there, and of course, there wasn't. I could tell that Copper was scared that I had to sleep in that room.

I have a tree by my window, but there's no way that it could make a shadow THAT dark. So for right now that's all I've seen of that thing.

The only thing I see or feel is Chloe and some orbs. But I'm not that scared of that anymore. They're harmless, I can tell you that. But I'm clueless on what the shadows are.

Please someone tell me what that thing was. I'm so scared for Logan's safety. I don't know if that thing is going to hurt Logan or my parents. I don't care if it hurts me, but if it hurts my family, then....

The Ghost On The Ship,"Texas, United States",Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: The Ghost On The Ship

I was on the USS Lexington, watching the Lewis and Clark movie in the theater and out of the corner of my eye I saw this sailor looking thing all in white walking around the corner. He was dressed like an old-fashioned sailor! I quickly turned toward that direction and just saw him walking around the corner.

I quickly tried to find some explanation for seeing him. The only reason I could think of was that he had maybe died on the ship.

So as soon as the movie was over I started telling my friend about it. She said it had just been my imagination but I think it was a lingering spirit not knowing he was dead.

I didn't see the spirit until I was in the engine room. I heard heavy footsteps and turned towards the sound. There was the man who I had seen in the theater.

I gasped and my friend came over and looked where I was staring. The spirit had left so she just said ""Stop scaring me...""

We were leaving the ship and I just happened to glance at a top window and saw 4 men in white old-fashioned Navy uniforms. I thought ' I've had enough, I'm going to research these sprits ' I looked at the history of the USS Lexington. I found out that many of the men that had once been on the ship died during attacks. I found pictures of the same men I had seen.

I've decided never to go back on the Lexington unless I have to.

Night Time Visitor,"California, United States",Old Hags / Night Attacks / Sleep Paralysis,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Old Hags / Night Attacks / Sleep Paralysis :: Night Time Visitor

I have always been interested in the paranormal since I was little, however the only times I would go ""looking"" for it was when my parents and I went on retreats to haunted locations like ghost towns in AZ or the Queen Mary in Long Beach, CA. I have been visited before as a child, but I'll save my stories for other postings. Let's start off with the most recent.

Just recently I have been experiencing something that I cannot understand! I need some help with this one because I can't sleep at night without having a light on. The way my room is set up, you walk in and to the right is my walk in closet, to the left is my bed with the foot of the bed being closest to my closet, and since I move back and forth from California to Portland, I have boxes all up against the back wall straight ahead, and my sliding glass door is to the right in the corner.

Anyways, when I'm watching TV at night before I go to bed, I always get the feeling that something is moving from the back of my closet to the front of my sliding glass door. I'll look over there, and you can see an outline of a black shadow that looks like it's crouching, waiting to pounce... Then when you look in the closet it looks like Spiderman almost, creeping in the corner. Or I'll look at the door of my closet and you'll see an outline of what looks like death (The grim reaper). But it's like they are wearing a hood or something.

Anyways, I was trying to ignore the feelings and get some sleep because it was 1 in the morning by now, but all of a sudden it felt as if someone had taken a vacuum and sucked all the air out of my blankets! I was trapped under my blankets! Then I felt something sit on the bed and creep toward me as if they were ready to pin me down or something. I freaked out so bad!

I tried to scream but I was so terrified, and I tried kicking the blankets off of me but they were sucked down on the bed so tight I couldn't move! So I made myself get a grip and I used all my force and got the hell out of there! I left all the lights on, my TV and my cell phone in my room on because I couldn't go back in there.

I keep having these experiences almost every night and I don't know what it is. Even sometimes when I look at my closet, there's this huge haze. Almost like a grey haze covering the closet door and that's when the feelings of many energies come into my room. I feel as if there's something curious in my room, but it hasn't ever happened to me before a couple weeks ago. When I see the haze, you can hear footsteps on the carpet, like there's someone walking around in my room! I have to turn the TV up because I can hear breathing sounds sometimes too, even during the day.

My room is the coldest room in the house. You have to bundle up just to slightly feel warm! Any advice helps, thanks!

Strange Attack,"Oregon, United States",Old Hags / Night Attacks / Sleep Paralysis,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Old Hags / Night Attacks / Sleep Paralysis :: Strange Attack

I have so much to say but everytime I try to write there are too many stories coming in. Anways, lately my dad has been gone during the weekends working down at the beach and leaving me at home. For a while it was the normal hearing of sounds or just a glimpse. Well one night it was different. My friend dropped me off at my house and left. When I walked into the house I could tell something was wrong. I got up to my room and the feeling of being in danger was all so close.

Then I heard Micheal whisper, ""run, I can't help you."" I got scared. Out of no where my school binder came flying at me and hit me in the head(don't laugh). But then it was like ""bathroom attack"" was happening all over again. Hands behind my back, choking. I don't know what happened. I don't remember most of it. All I remember is that the three of them were attacking me. Like my hair was being pulled. Hands were forcing my face on the floor so I couldn't look up to see what was going on.

I was crying and screaming but the more I did the more my hair was being pulled and my face was pushed into the floor. I woke up the next day in bed, drained of all energy. I was there in bed for three days. I got all the marks and brusies from this. Whats happening? Why is this happening? And how do I get them to leave? Anyone please?

My Worst Night,"California, United States",Apparitions / Voices / Touches,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Apparitions / Voices / Touches :: My Worst Night

D uring college, I spent some time living at my grandparents' house. While not being the cleanest place, it was free and I was helping my grandparents out. My grandparents' house is next door to the house I grew up in; where I had had many ghost experiences I would rather forget.

I had been living in their house for two or three months and was just getting settled, so I decided I would do some meditation before I went to bed just to calm down. While meditating, I kept getting the message that I should stop, but I didn't see why. I kept going- big mistake. If you ever get the feeling that you are going too far in meditating and you should stop, please do!

I ended my meditation and prepared to go to bed. I was feeling a little sick, but I figured I spent too much energy and that is what the ""stop"" message had meant.

No more than five minutes after I lay down, I saw her. The little girl I hadn't seen in two years of being away from the house I grew up in. ""We found you"", she said to me. I nearly jumped out of the covers. ""We...?"" This could not be good. This night was going to be the absolute worst night of my life as far as the paranormal goes.

I was looking at this little girl, not really making out much about her but her size and  face, getting her message ""We found you"" pulsing through my blood.

A man and a little person I had also seen in my youth were next. All of them saying the same; not in words, but sending a feeling of creepy happiness, ""We found you"". I was petrified and I didn't know what to do. I thought about waking my grandparents, but my grandmother is schizophrenic and I wouldn't be able to explain it to my grandfather.

My room by this time felt full with spirits trying to contact me all feeling like they found me. I get the creeps thinking about the feeling I had, as if all my room was full of pressure but for my half of the bed. I didn't know what to do in the slightest, so I called my best friend and told him he had to come over at that moment. I knew he would understand because he had also had some experiences with ghosts when he was very young.

I worked up the courage to turn the light on and unlock the front door, but the feeling persisted. My friend was over very quickly and came to sit on the bed with me. He suggested I try again to go to sleep. When he turned out the light, they were still all there, but no longer ""speaking"" to me. He also felt the pressure of the room being full. We tried to ignore it and get to sleep. They didn't like that.

There was a tapping on the window, then on the bed post. My friend asked me to please stop tapping my fingernail on the bed. I wasn't. It just kept tapping. We didn't say a word about it after that.

Then we heard noises from outside. He described it as a small plane flying close by. I thought it sounded more like a subway train going by. That continued periodically as well for the duration of the night.

It was very late before we fell into an exhausted sleep. In the morning it was all gone. I moved out of my grandparents shortly after and I have not spent the night in that house since. It was the worst, most intense night I have had in all of my experiences.

Am I Really Crazy?,"Texas, United States",A Haunted Life,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: A Haunted Life :: Am I Really Crazy?

I f you read my story ""Life Long Journey of Weird Experiences"" you will know I mentioned something about strange occurrences that happened when I was a teen. I don't believe they're paranormal, but it was definitely something.

I've always been an angry person. I don't know why, but I used to be so cold and mean. If I didn't get my way, I thought everyone had to suffer too. I think most teenage kids think like that though. Well as you can imagine, people didn't always like me. I mostly fought with guys because they thought I would take their crap and I never did.

Around the age of 17, I would say certain things and they'd happen. It was very coincidental. My friends were freaked out by it. So they told me to pick someone, pick a date and a time and what was going to happen and we'll all see what happens. Well, I did and it happened. I think it involved some girl we didn't like, getting a speeding ticket or something to that nature-nothing bad. This girl, by the way, messed around with spells and whatnot. She was not a nice person.

Well, after that incident, I felt pretty ""powerful"" because of it. I had some ""gift"" that no one else had. At least that's how I thought of it then. (My views have changed A LOT since I was a kid) People would try and throw stuff at me when I wasn't looking and I would catch it. Like my reflexes were extra sensitive. Now, I know a lot of you are thinking ""what is this girl on...?"" I wouldn't believe it myself if someone told me this, but this stuff really happened. And I freaked a few people out because of it. It wasn't terrifying in any way, just weird. I think my best friend, when she'd tell people about it, they beefed it up some as well.

Back to the anger issue, when I would get mad I would wish bad things to happen to people-nothing fatal, but something significant. Now, I don't remember exactly what I wished to happen, because I did this a lot. My anger created a playing field for my so-called ""gift"".

Well, little did I know that it would be a heavy burden on me. I was always sick and my depression just got worse and worse. I began hating myself and pushing my friends away. I was very destructive. At the time, I didn't realize any of it was connected, but I know now that it was.

Now, even though I still believe this has something to do with our minds. I can't help but wonder why things came back to me. Was it karma, maybe? I strongly believe in mind over matter. Our brains are very powerful, but most of us use very little of it. I guess some people can activate some weird powers our brains have. I don't know. I think it's possible for anyone to will something to happen. It happens all the time.

After a few years, I finally had to convince myself to stop wishing such negative things on people. It never made me feel any better. Negativity can bring you down really low. I've been there many times and don't wish to go back there. The only demons I've faced are my own.

Another weird incident happened when I was like 18, I believe. My friend, her boyfriend, his friend and I all went to see Independence Day. On our way to the theatre, a man was leaving as we were coming. Things began to move in slow motion for me. I had locked eyes with this man. I had no idea who he was. And he said, ""God?"" and I replied back with, ""No, I'm not God..."" and then things were in real time because I heard my friends laughing. And the dude looked at me confused and said he had asked me if I was okay or something. It was strange.

We still laugh about that to this day, but I can't understand why that happened. What was its significance? Was I hallucinating? Did my mind go nuts?

I don't know. Things like that still happen sometimes, but I ignore them because I know people think I'm crazy.

This next one may be paranormal or my mind was playing tricks on me. I mentioned the depression earlier in this story. I didn't start medicating myself until I was 25. I was against drugs (apparently, not marijuana) for a large part of my life, but by the time I was 25, I had gone to a dark place and couldn't come out of it. I saw a doctor and he put me on  anti-depressants. It made me catatonic, so I stopped using them. So he put me on something else. It didn't help me, in fact, I felt worse.

Well, I don't want to admit this, but I tried to end my life one night after days and days of continuous crying and self-loathing. I failed, thankfully and I spent a week in the psych ward. The doctors really didn't tell me anything. They were very rude, actually. The nurses were nice and so were the counsellors they had on staff for group meetings we all had to attend 3 times a day. I did not know what drugs they were making me take, but they made me extremely tired and groggy when I had to wake up. So I was in this stoned-like state a lot.

The last day I was there, I woke up at 5 in the morning. I looked around and it was pitch black and I was a bit groggy. I lied back down and tried to go back to sleep. A little bit later, I felt someone sit on the bed with me. And these are those thermal hospital beds that have air in them, so if someone sits on the corner, the other side will raise some. So something sat on the bed and I thought it was my mother who came early to pick me up. I opened my eyes and no one was there. I was a bit freaked out, so I went and talked to one of the nurses in the nurse's station and she told me to  try to go to sleep. I was still out of it, so I did what she said.

When it was time to check out, the doctor came in there and gave me prescriptions for 2 anti-depressants (one with anti-anxiety) and a schizophrenic drug called Seroquel. At the time, I didn't know its purpose. Well I get home and I kept seeing black objects in the corner of my eyes move. I'd wake up from sleeping and see spiders coming down towards my head from their webs. AND I HATE SPIDERS. I was freaking out! I went online and tried to see what the side effects of these drugs were and that's when I found out about Seroquel. I immediately stopped taking it and the side effects eventually stopped.

Has anyone else had problems with anti-depressants and other such drugs? Did the drugs make me believe someone sat on my bed?

At The Museum 2,Canada,Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: At The Museum 2

I wrote earlier about my job in the local museum. If you haven't read that story, it would be a good idea to do so now, just to get an idea of the layout of the buildings, and to know what has happened so far.

A few days after I had written my last story, I was sitting at my desk in the office building. This building has a door facing the street that I keep propped open with a brick so people passing by will see that the museum is open. There I was sitting and cataloging some old books when I heard a loud scrapping noise. I looked up and saw the brick sliding away from the door, than the door slammed shut. I ran over to see what had caused it but could find nothing. The wind wasn't strong enough to push the door shut, and there was no one around. The brick hadn't just been pushed by the door, it looked as though it had been pulled away, allowing the door to slam. This has happened five times over all. Two of the times it was quite windy out, so I assumed the wind was the culprit, but for the other three times I haven't a clue.

For the first month or so that I worked in the museum I always had a strange feeling whenever I walked into the cabin. It was like I had just barged in somewhere uninvited. It never felt totally mean, and I never felt threatened, but I never felt welcomed either. In fact, as the days went on, I began to feel as if whatever was there was teasing me.I would hear whispers or footsteps from one room, go to check it out, and hear those noises in the room I had just left.

Other times I would put something down, turn away, and when I looked back it would be moved. Not a lot, but enough that I could tell. This went on until one day about two weeks ago. That was a rough day. Genius that I am, I had stayed up way to late the night before, and, as a result, was very tired. It had been raining and my feet were wet (I hate that). To top it all off, the very first thing I saw when I went into the cabin was a giant spider; I hate them even more than wet feet. In short, I was a very cranky tour guide.

As I was opening up the cabin that lousy day, one of the table clothes began whipping back and forth loudly and quickly. Before that day when something happened that I couldn't explain, I would get spooked. That day, though, I was in no mood to be played around with, so I just rolled my eyes, said ""whatever"" and continued on with my work. The tablecloth instantly stopped moving and from between me and the table, I heard a soft giggle.

Since that day, whenever I walk into the cabin it feels warm and welcoming. I no longer feel like I don't belong there. Things still happen, but it doesn't feel like teasing.

The latest strange thing to happen in the cabin was last weekend. There had been quite a few visitors and as a result I was there later than usual. In the cabin I saw wet foot prints on the floor in the back kitchen. They looked as though someone with wet feet had walked from the doorway to the main room to where there was a larger wet spot in front of the table where the guest book is, exactly what you would get if somebody with wet shoes had stood there for a few minutes reading the names. Now, this in itself wouldn't have been odd except for one thing. I had been in the kitchen and had just walked to the doorway to tell my Mom I would be a few more minutes.

There were no prints when I walked to the door, and they were there when I turned back. I was tired and it was late, so I decided to ignore it and close up for the night. As I walked from the kitchen to the main room, I saw someone poke their head out of a bedroom, look at me, than go back into the room.

I couldn't make out any detail since they were between me and the light and was just a silhouette. All I could tell was this person was about the same height as me, five feet (yeah, yeah I'm a shorty). It seemed to me as if they were saying ""You still here?"" I went into the room to check, but, of course, it was empty. Like I said, it had been a long day and I was tired, so I just closed the curtains, turned out the lights, told whoever was there ""goodnight"" and went home.

John And Sally Doe,"Michigan, United States",Children Who See Spirits,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Children Who See Spirits :: John And Sally Doe

I used to stay with my Aunt Debbie and Uncle Joe every couple of weeks or so, as I was very close to my cousin Jennifer. They had a big pool in their backyard and a really nice deck, and we would swim and ""lay out"" all day, playing house, pretending to be women and not two girls of six and eight years. It was a good time.

One day, a girl and a boy came over, both of whom must have been associated with my cousins in some way. I don't remember their names, so for the sake of this story, they are John and Sally. John and Sally Doe. (John and Jane isn't as catchy.)

Jennifer didn't seem to care for them much, but Aunt Debbie didn't want either of us to be rude to our guests, so we played together nonetheless. She made us lemonade, and the four of us sat out on the deck talking. John showed off with some cool diving techniques in the pool (perhaps they wouldn't be so cool to a nineteen-year-old Brittany, but the six-year-old Brittany was quite pleased), and Sally honestly didn't do much of anything that stood out, but I supposed it wouldn't be far fetched to say that I probably had a small crush on John.

Both children had yet to lose their baby fat, I suppose. Sally had really long mousy-brown hair which she tied back. She was wearing a one-piece bathing suit- I think that it was black with a couple of really big pink flowers. I don't really remember that much about their appearance. However, when the evening was nearing, both John and Sally said that they had to return home or they could risk a good grounding, and so Jennifer and I walked them out to the sidewalk where we said our goodbyes. I was always shy as a child, and I remember standing in front of Sally, Jennifer in front of John, the sunlight nearly blinding me, feeling somewhat anti-social. I never liked the end of the day because it meant the end of fun, and I suppose I felt a little sad, too. I looked down at the sidewalk and noticed that Sally's toe nail was black, but not from nail polish. I asked her what she did to it.

Sally explained that her father was mowing the lawn and he told her to move out of the way, but she wouldn't listen, and he accidentally hit her toe. John was silent. I asked her if it hurt and she said she cried when it happened. I recalled an instance that happened not too long ago to my best friend Timothy, who injured his finger while helping his dad saw wood because he heard me throwing a tantrum next door (we lived in the same apartment building). He wasn't seriously hurt, but his finger nail surely was.

I told Sally about this but she didn't say much, or at least enough that I could remember now (twelve or thirteen years later), but they both turned and walked away and Jennifer and I followed suit.

Two weeks passed and I found myself spending the night with my aunt and uncle once again. One morning I went into my Aunt Debbie's room while she was applying her make-up and asked her if she remembered John and Sally Doe (I was hoping that if I mentioned them in a nonchalant way, she would invite them over again and I could avoid awkward questions- remember when I said I was shy?), but her answer wasn't what I expected at all.

Confused, I tried to explain who they were- the two kids that came over and played with Jennifer and myself. She made us lemonade! She told us not to be rude!

However, my Aunt Debbie became slightly angry at Jennifer for having friends over without her permission, and Jennifer, equally confused, argued that she didn't know a John and Sally Doe, and I argued on her behalf that Aunt Debbie was there and met them, and I just wanted them to come play with us again. No go. Neither of them remembered John and Sally's visit. Jennifer swore she never met them. Aunt Debbie thought I was telling stories.

The Tote,"Michigan, United States",Misc,"W hile I was away at school (read Haunted Dorm at Eastern Michigan University), my mom took care of my little Yorkie, Lily Sue. Lily was a couple months old, weighing two pounds. When my mom left for work in the morning she made sure to place a gate at the end of the kitchen and the beginning of the hallway, where a potty pad was also in place, as well as Lily's food, water, and her favorite toys (socks, to be perfectly honest), and this worked just fine for months.

Lily's gate was also placed directly under the handle to the attic door, which basically hangs from the ceiling. My dad is the only one in the house who can reach it, but he worked an entirely different shift than my mom. One evening, maybe twenty minutes after my mom returned home from work, she scooped Lily up in her arms and took her outside with her while she smoked a cigarette. As soon as the screen door shut, she heard a loud thud. She ran into the house immediately to find that a large, heavy tote full of old family portraits had fallen onto Lily's potty pad, where both of them had been just seconds before.

Of course the tote had fallen out of the attic, but the attic also latches into the ceiling. One must grab the handle to unlatch the door, and then pull down the ladder in order to gain access into our attic. The most important detail, in my opinion, is that this tote was pushed the farthest back from the door- so far, in fact, that it was slightly hidden in the floor insulation, behind OTHER totes.

All of the glass was shattered, the frames broken, and the family portraits were strewn about the kitchen floor.

Things That Go Bump In The Evening,"Michigan, United States",Apparitions / Voices / Touches,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Apparitions / Voices / Touches :: Things That Go Bump In The Evening

I was trying to write a paper (a really important paper, at that) when I received an unexpected call from my mom. She didn't even bother to say ""Hello"".

I was a little surprised, but I told her that I had actually triggered my asthma the week before, but all symptoms had ceased and I was just fine. I asked what her deal was. She seemed really shocked that I wasn't dying (my mom has always been the dramatic one in the family), and then started explaining to me that she had just gotten home from work, had just eaten dinner, and had just started watching Reba on Lifetime, when, quite distinctly, she heard me coughing in my bedroom.

Completely forgetting that she was all alone in the house (as she was every evening), she yelled out something about getting a drink of water or taking my inhaler, and stopped herself mid-sentence when reality struck her and she remembered I was away at school.

She went on to say that I did not respond (surprise!), that she did peek inside my room and no one was there (surprise!), and that she was, to say the least, rather creeped out.

I told her that she must have been hearing things and maybe she was just over-tired from work (anything to get her off the phone so that I could finish my paper), when she said:

I was a little tired myself, and she was afraid that our house was haunted, so I told her I really needed to get off the phone to write a paper for class. She unwillingly hung up. She hasn't mentioned it since.

"The Devil, And The Graveyard","Pennsylvania, United States",Demons / Possessions / Exorcisms,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Demons / Possessions / Exorcisms :: The Devil, And The Graveyard

T his story takes place in 1986 when I was eight years old. It was June and my Grandfather had passed away a week or two before father's day. All of our family went to the graveyard after the wake like families do. Most of the grown ups were gathered at the grave and all of us kids (probably 20 of us) were all standing further away talking and some were playing tag around the headstones. I know, not very respectful, but there were a lot of little kids all being very impatient.

All of a sudden, all of the noises stopped, the birds weren't chirping, I can't remember hearing the adults talking- I couldn't even hear the other kids. I looked around and I saw something out of the corner of my eye walking along the edge of the graveyard right on the tree line. I weaved through the other kids to get a better look. And right there walked the devil-red skin, horns, tail, and all. I was just frozen, unable to move, or talk. I couldn't do anything but stand there and stare.

After what seemed like a long time, I was able to look around and my little brother was standing next to me. He was 5. I don't remember him coming up to me. I was still terrified and went to find my mother. I took my little brother by the hand to go find her. The whole time, I was trying to keep my eye on the tree line to see if I could still see him.

When I found my mother I tried to get her to look around. My little brother was crying, come to think of it, I was probably too. My mom wouldn't pay much attention to us. So I started yelling ""just look over there"".

I guess I was making a big scene so my mother pulled me and my brother away from the adults and asked what was wrong. I told her to look but she said all she saw was a man walking along the edge of the graveyard. I remember saying ""a man you see a man..."" She said ""Yes, a man in a black suit"".

She also told me to calm down and that the man was probably walking over there not to disturb us. She also told us we had to quit carrying on, that we were at a funeral and had to be respectful.

I stood right next to her the rest of the time with my little brother attached to her other side. No one saw him, not the other kids, not any of the grown ups. Just I and I think my little brother, but he would never talk about it. When I would ask him he would say he didn't see anything and would get me in trouble for scaring him, so I eventually dropped it, but I know what I saw I can still see it today if I think about it.

Being an adult now I have tried to process it but still come up with the same thing. I saw the devil that day in the graveyard.

My brother would never talk about it, not even years later. But he has been in trouble all of his life. Detention home, to prison, to drugs, you name it. I always wondered if that day had something to do with it.

He insists he doesn't know what I'm talking about. He says he doesn't even remember the funeral. Maybe he's blocking it out.

I eventually told my mother but it wasn't for about a year since it happened. When I told her she did say she believed me and she was sorry for not paying attention to me when I was that upset.

I have had other paranormal experiences through out my life but nothing has ever compared to the fear and stomach dropping feeling I felt that day.

Haunted Life?,"Ohio, United States",A Haunted Life,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: A Haunted Life :: Haunted Life?

M y name is Saddie and I'm 17 years old. My family has moved around a lot but wherever we move it seems as if there is always some sort of presence that moves with us. It never has felt like an intimidating or aggressive presence, though.

We have most currently moved to Ohio and the house we currently live in is only about 20-something years old. The first night I slept in my new room I didn't have a fan or anything on to make any noise during the night (which bothers me because I hate trying to sleep in complete silence...it's just too eerie) and I could hear this deep breathing noise like a man so I turned on my TV to tune it out.

The next morning I woke up because I heard whispering near my door. My bed is about 10 or so feet from my door but I was pretty much terrified, like I was literally frozen in fear listening to this voice that seemed like it was chanting something. It just kept saying the same thing over and over again.

I finally worked up the courage to move my hand from under my covers to my radio and it blocked out the noise. So I started feeling tired again and I shut off my radio to go back to sleep... But as soon as I shut my eyes, I felt like somebody had put their mouth up to my ear and whispered my name which completely freaked me out and I walked as quickly as I could out of my room and I felt like something was watching me the entire time.

The next few nights I could still hear the masculine breathing (it's not like it was up close or anything, but it's as if it was on the other side of my bed (and I have a king sized bed if that gives you an idea...) but I would just tune it out with my radio or my television and it would be gone away.

It's been about 5 years since that happened but something really strange happened to me a few months back

I got home from school exhausted, so I went to take a nap on a couch in the living room. My mom was in the next room over so I wasn't alone or anything in the house. Anyway, I opened my eyes and I could NOT move at all. I tried moving my foot but I couldn't even do that for some reason and it was as if something had tapped into my mind and started overloading it with a bunch of information.

It sounds really weird, I know, but that's just how it felt and there's no other way to describe it. There was a name I picked up and it was ""Robert"" or I felt like another name, for whomever or whatever it was, ""Bobby"".

I don't know any ""Robert"" and after I got that information, it felt as if I had been released from my temporary paralysis. I don't know what that means or why that happened... I know I wasn't dreaming because I walked out the room and went to talk to my mom (I didn't tell her about it because I didn't want her to freak out or).

There are two bedrooms upstairs and my sister lives across the hall from me. One night it was really late when she got home from work. She was talking to my mother downstairs while I was still asleep upstairs. In the middle of the conversation, she saw my door open wide into my room. I always sleep with it shut... And there wasn't a draft to open it or anything.

For the past few nights, I have been sleeping with it open... And two nights ago I heard it shut quietly when I was the only person home... As if somebody had held onto my door handle and tried to quietly shut it. I've heard my door handle jiggle some nights when I'm watching TV or I'm talking on the phone.

In this house I've heard whistling, I've heard my name being whispered, I've seen doors close, I've felt like something is inches from my face just staring at me, and I don't know what to make of it. I've heard different voices ranging from a woman to a deep-voiced masculine man. Like I said, it's never felt like it means to harm me... But it wants my attention and at the same time it's terrifying to hear what you can't see and knowing ""it"" can see you and ""it"" knows you can't see them.

I've always had something making itself known to me but recently it's gotten worse and worse. Even as I write this I feel like there's something watching every move I make.

Has anyone else had this sort of thing happen to them at all? I'm really confused about what's going on and what to think about it. Any feedback would be very helpful and I'd deeply appreciate it!

Growing Up In A Haunted House,Canada,Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: Growing Up In A Haunted House

I 've had some odd experiences in my life but it really all started when I was 9 years old and my mother, sisters and I had just moved into a new house. My parents had divorced a few years earlier and we had been renting places to live until my Mum could afford a home of her own.

I went to look at the house with my family before my mum bought it and a young family lived there who were hunters. They had a lot of stuffed animals hanging on the walls which I thought was rather grotesque. Before we moved in my mum and aunt painted the kitchen an atrocious colour of yellow and did some basic touch ups around the place to make it cozy. It was/is a split level home with 3 bedrooms upstairs and a partially finished basement.

From the first night it was a pretty active place. Footsteps in the hallway, a weird continuous sound at night like a pencil rolling on the table. I often felt watched, particularly from the left hand upper corner of my bedroom. The longer we stayed there the more obvious or active it became. I would hear someone calling my name at night while I was trying to sleep, things would fall off the walls for no apparent reason, knocking on the walls, that kind of thing.

I would relate my feelings and experiences to my Mother and sisters, who would either laugh or try to convince me of my overactive imagination. I did have a pretty vivid imagination but these things were different.

Things really picked up when we got a dog. She would suddenly, in the middle of the day, start to whine, shiver and try to hide. As this continued, I realized that this was a sign that something was about to happen, like the TV switching off or banging on the walls.

One time the dog freaked out when we were all sitting in the living room watching TV one winter evening as it was snowing. We were watching 'Dallas' for all of you out there who are old enough to remember. As we watched the dog cowered with fear as our front doors opened.

First the outer screen door, then the heavier inner door and it sounded like someone came in. We all sat there looking at each other, sort of stunned. I should mention none of us saw the doors open. Being a bi-level, the door was down a flight of stairs.

My Mum went and checked but no one was there. It was all so 'off' and slowly we figured out why. You had to go through a gate to get to our door and at the sound of the gate our dog would bark. No gate, no barking, no person, no footprints in the snow! I realize that may seem kind of cliche but it happened!

I didn't ever want to tell anyone what was going on but one day I confessed to a friend, who lived on the block before we moved in, about the strange house. She told me she never wanted to go to my house because someone had killed themselves in it before we moved in!

Apparently the mother/wife who I had met had her brother living there and he shot himself in the kitchen. It explained why my Mum could afford a new house in a nice neighborhood and it explained why she and my aunt had used that awful shade of yellow-to cover the stains.

When I asked my Mother about this she confirmed the death but reassured me there was nothing to fear and I was imagining things.

Many things happened but the last strong happening was one evening when I was well into teenage-hood and both my older sisters had moved out. I 'graduated' into my sister's room that had been built in the basement. It had that kind of partition/hanging ceiling, the kind with rectangles sitting in a grid. I don't know what it's called but I'm sure you can picture it. If the window was open and a breeze blew in, the ceiling would make a whoosh sound as the tiles lifted or if the door was opened quickly.

Anyway, a friend and I were sitting in my room chatting late one night when all of a sudden we hear footsteps coming down the stairs. If it was my Mum coming to tell us to go to bed we would've heard her leaving her room, but these just started at the steps. I can't explain it, but what happened was just electric. My dog started to whine and cower under the blankets. We heard the steps come across the basement floor towards the door and without the window being open or the door opening WHOOSH, the tiles lifted as though someone just came in the room.

The entire time, as the dog was freaking out my friend and I just locked eyes and all the hairs on my body stood up. I can't explain the feeling but it felt electric and very, very primal. Like my physical response was animal-like. Everything just seemed to stop and we roared out of there upstairs and didn't go back down.

Years later, after I was an adult and we hadn't lived there for years my mother confessed to me that she knew it was...active. She woke up one night with the intense feeling of someone staring at her and saw a light human shaped form move quickly back and disappeared through the wall. She also explained the dreadful colour choice in the kitchen. My sisters didn't experience anything, but now believe me when I tell them about it.

I'll also have to post about another night I had another friend stay over and ping-pong balls were rolling across the floor for no apparent reason in the middle of the night. Needless to say not too many sleepovers after that and the kids at school were scared of me.

After this and other similar experiences throughout my life I've come to believe some of the occurrences were poltergeist activity due to all the female energy and some personal upset as you can well imagine with a single Mother with 3 daughters.

However, other things are totally unexplainable and of the supernatural and I think that the longer we were there, the more the activity gradually becoming hostile and very negative.

I welcome any questions and will be sure to post the other happenings since then. I can happily say that my current home of more than 6 years is really peaceful and I haven't known this kind of stillness anywhere I've ever lived.

Hospitals Are Haunted,"Ohio, United States",Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: Hospitals Are Haunted

A s some of you know, I work as a Medical Secretary in the hospital in my town. I have been there for a year now. I'm going to share a few scary experiences with you that I have had so far into my career.

First of all I have to say that I was very skeptical taking this position because visiting this hospitals' ER as a patient in the past I have had some very eerie feelings. You know the kind of feelings when you're alone but you sense others around you, or when you feel like your being watched? Well this is how I felt every time I came in there-even as a child.

After I was offered the position, after careful consideration, I accepted it. The offer was too good to refuse. The school that I had graduated from sent out resumes for all the graduates to all the local facilities that were hiring, and the hospital was offering me an exceptional salary, and benefit package.

Anyhow, onto my stories: My first few weeks on the job, I was in orientation. All was well. I was working day shift 8am to 5pm, on the 10th floor which is the respiratory care unit. I started making friends with all the nurses, and other staff. Things were great, there were no scary feelings, or maybe I just didn't have time to feel them at that point.

Well after 4 weeks of orientation I was put on 2nd shift: 3-11pm. This is when the freaky stuff started to occur. One night I got on the elevator (by myself) as usual for my first break of the evening, (I'm a smoker so I usually take my breaks outside).

I pushed in the #1 button and the doors closed. The computerized voice system said ""going down"". I then heard the voice of an elderly woman in almost a whisper say ""six please"" I lifted my head up to sort of look around. Knowing I was the only one in there it was just a normal reaction.

All of the sudden the elevator dings, and the doors open up. In front of me sat a run down old dusty nurses station, (I was on the 6th floor.) I had not seen this floor before. The walls were torn down half way: there were tools and things lying all over. This floor at the time was closed for renovations. I was kind of shaken at that point. I pushed the #1 button 2 or 3 times hard wanting the doors to shut quickly. As they began to shut I heard the same woman's voice say ""thank you"".

The elevator proceeded down to the first floor and I got off. I went and sat on the benches directly across from them almost in disbelief. At that point, my mind was running wild. I'm looking down both ends of the halls. This time at night, there are very few people in this area mostly staff and they are just randomly passing through.

That little voice in my head kept saying ""did that really just happen?"" I sat there a minute longer and said a prayer, (That comforts me). I went on outside and that strange, eerie feeling stayed with me.

On my way back in I stopped at the security station in the ER and asked to be escorted back up to 10. It's a long scary walk through those dim-lit hallways from one end of the hospital to the other. There are a lot of different elevators but they all go to different areas of the hospital and of course the ones I use daily are the furthest away.

I made my way back upstairs. The charge nurse asked why I had security come with me. I felt a little stupid telling her my story, but it felt good to let it out. She said that I shouldn't feel crazy about experiencing that because she had been here for almost 20 years and that she has had even stranger things happen. She said that some people who work there say that they have not seen or heard anything out of the ordinary, but there are others who have insisted that they have seen and heard ghosts and spirits roaming through the halls and in the patients' rooms every time they work.

I have more tales to tell so I will be back with the other experiences. Thanks for reading my post. Feel free to comment I will check back daily and discuss any issues.

Goodbye Grandpa,Canada,Family / Friends Visits,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Family / Friends Visits :: Goodbye Grandpa

I have had a few experiences with ghosts over the years. I figure I'll share one to start with, don't want to bog down the listings again (as I read they were when I joined).

My earliest experience came as a child, probably about 7. I was asleep in my room, when I suddenly woke up. I could feel someone in the room with me, I knew the feeling right away, it was my Great Grandfather, I don't really know how I knew, but I did.

This Great Grandfather lived 650 Kilometers away as the crow flies or about 1100 Kilometers by road (mountains in the way) and yet I could feel him there. I told my parents the next morning that ""Great Grandpa was in my room last night"" and they told me they had gotten a call from my Nana that her father (Great Grandpa) had passed away sometime in the night.

My parents never doubted what I had experienced and told me that Great Grandpa had just come to say goodbye before he left this world. I have never figured out why of anyone he came to say goodbye to me. He was always closer to my older sister than me.

Interestingly enough, my father would have a similar experience years later with his childhood friend and blood brother with whom he had sworn an oath that the first one to die would let the other one know that he was gone.

The Lady In Door E,Philippines,Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: The Lady In Door E

T his is the continuation of the Townhouse Apartment. Some people are wondering how I can be so cool hearing those weird sounds. Well I wasn't, I just try to find some explanation about everything, and I'm always telling myself that maybe it is just from something or from the neighbors.

Whenever my sisters are afraid of something like hearing those sounds, I'm always the one who's trying to keep their cool because no one will and if my fear gets the best of me, then  all of us will just panic. That is why in my stories (Townhouse Apartment) you may think I'm not afraid to face anything most of the time. The truth is I just don't have much choice.

Anyway, on those days my little sister was not with us anymore because she was with our parents all the time. She is still young and we might neglect her when my older sister and I are busy.

I have asked about the history of the place. The elderly said 15 to 18 years ago, around 1990, the whole place was a farm-no houses, no street lights and very few vehicles passing by. It was a dreadful place not because of ghosts but because of criminals lurking around.

Many transport drivers (jeep and tricycle) are afraid to go that way because of the frequency of crime. There were reports of rapes, robberies and slaughters where the victims were covered with newspapers under which they lied naked or worse, sometimes in pieces (head, arms and legs).

Because of this the nearby residence got curfew from the municipality. Until the time of the residential project, the farm was replaced by new subdivisions, parks, cement road and street lights. The time I was living there, I could almost visualise the former picture of that place by seeing few farms left intact.

One night I was invited by my neighbour, Ryl, (a very close friend of mine) to their house Door F (ours was in Door D) to witness the meteor shower. It was around 10pm as I can remember when it started.

We were having a great time counting all the shooting stars while eating our favorite junk food at the parking area of the apartment, just in front of their door. It was so amazing having a small picnic of our own.

I was talking to her while my mind was still focused on counting the falling stars when I noticed she wouldn't respond to me anymore. I rested my head a little then turned my attention to her. Ryl's eyes were fixed in front of her where the big entrance gate was located. I was little irritated and told her that she was not paying attention, and asked her if there was something wrong that she wanted to talk about? Ryl immediately asked me to go back in the house because she's getting cold, so we did.

In her house I checked the time- it was 11:30pm and we went straight to the kitchen to wash the dishes.

She asked ""Did you see it?"" without even looking at me. ""See what? She then told me. ""The reason why I was not answering you was because there was someone in the main gate walking towards us. A lady that I thought would be a visitor of yours because she looked like one of your friends"" (then she mentioned one of my friends name) ""but I noticed as she was getting closer, I couldn't see her feet. It was covered by her long white dress and her face was blurred.""

She went on, ""she was 4 steps away from us when I thought in Jesus Name you can't go near us. Then she entered door E through the walls. I could see the fear in her teary eyes"".

I was shocked to hear that and felt sad for my friend because she was very frightened. I stayed the night with Ryl for I was also too chicken to go back to my house (Door D) or as much as walk next to Door E where she said the lady went.

Door E was always vacant, I don't know why but the people who live there don't stay long compared to my other neighbors who had been living at that apartment for years. Maybe that door was cursed or it's just coincidence.

That same friend, Ryl was a former resident of Door E but requested to be moved to door F because her nieces were always ill, couldn't sleep properly at night and always pointed at something and cry.

Her third eye was open long time ago but she refuses to accept this gift or curse. She said she can see different figures in that apartment; there was a man, a lady and one old creepy woman wearing all black with a waist length veil that covered her face (it's a different story). Of course they cannot give that reason to the management so they just said door E needs a new paint and some electrical wiring fixed.

Then the next day when I was about to go to school, a neighbour- not from the same apartment- who lives in front of us (outside the compound) asked me if Door E was already occupied.

I told her ""no, not yet. Are you interested?"" She answered with a query face ""but last night I saw a lady at the 2nd floor windows of Door E so I thought there are new people in the apartment, around 11:30pm"".

I said ""no Door E is still empty and I wouldn't miss the sound of someone moving in next to us, that's for sure"".

And then she left still wondering. I felt chills thinking that it might be the same lady Ryl saw that night. Since then I don't like looking at the window of Door E where I used to check my hair and reflection before leaving.

Strange Encounter,"South Carolina, United States",Apparitions / Voices / Touches,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Apparitions / Voices / Touches :: Strange Encounter

T his story takes place a few years ago in my suburban home. This house probably hasn't been around more than 20 years, and nothing sinister that I know of has taken place here before us moving in.

As a young boy, I was very much interested in the supernatural, and I played with Ouija boards and the like. We even pretended we saw demons all the time. This became reality soon enough.

One of my cousins, about 15 at the time, was babysitting me and my little brother in the house alone, near 10:00 at night while my parents left to shop. We heard noises nearby, but thought nothing of them. I got up to get a drink of water, when I glanced into the hallway, and saw a dark figure, draped in a black robe with a hood. He drifted from my little brother's room to my parents' room. He didn't walk. He just floated.

We were quick to grab a knife from the kitchen, and hide behind the couch. I eventually mustered up enough confidence to look into my room, and when I did, the figure was gone. I haven't seen it again since then. However, I do always have this feeling that something is around, watching, waiting. It won't show itself, but I know it's there.

I am a rather empathetic (my sixth-sense is very strong) person, and I can feel its presence throughout the house when I am alone. I'll be in the living room watching TV, and I will have the feeling that something is in the hallway, and when I turn to look, nothing is there. I've tried talking to it, and tried getting it to send me energy signals, but nothing has worked.

I have a feeling that it is something to do with the Ouija board. I saw the ghost of a great-aunt of mine about 2 years before that. She was floating at the edge of my bed.

I've also felt like something went through me and chills go throughout my body.

Visited by my Relatives,Indonesia,Family / Friends Visits,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Family / Friends Visits :: Visited by my Relatives

T his is my first story. I am not normally sensitive to these things, my mom is, though not spectacularly, but I am quite ""immune"" to supernatural things.

But this one was real, and until now it was very clear in my mind.

I was about 20 yrs old that time, living in Indonesia. One night I was sleeping, and ""dreaming"" of opening my eyes while still lying on the bed. The room was dark, only some light from the window. The door was opened ajar (which was a bit strange as my door has spring, so always in close position unless someone is holding it open).

I saw some figures around my bed. I couldn't see their faces, but I knew they were my relatives even though only one of them I was sure was my eldest uncle (coming from Asian families, I have a lot of close, not-so-close, distant and very distant...""relatives"". Most of the elderly ones I know only by names).

Not scared at all, I ""dreamt"" I only lied down watching them for a while, feeling that they wanted something from me, not sure what to do and had no intention to do anything either. Suddenly I felt someone was calling me repeatedly, then... I woke up.

Mom was standing beside me looking relieved that I woke up. She had been calling me for some time, but I didn't respond. Then what she told me afterwards got me shivering in the middle of a hot night in a tropical country.

She said when she was sleeping in her own bedroom she dreamt that some relatives, including her eldest brother who had passed away many years ago, came to visit me. They were trying to invite me to follow them to...not sure where. She got really scared and woke up running to my bedroom to stop me from going with them.

Until now I am still scared to remember this. How come mom and I had such ""re-occurring"" dreams? What happened if she didn't wake me up?

I grew up with him, but he passed away when I was small. I was the first grandchild in my mom's large family of 5 uncles and 1 aunt who spoiled me very much. Then, after mom and dad moved to our own house, only the unmarried eldest uncle came to live with us.

He was very smart, very strict and certainly not a toddler's favorite. He tried to teach me many things, even English which was obviously not very successful. His lessons were hard, the reward too small (one small candy or raisin after each lesson), and he never smiled. Probably because of that I tended to stay away from him. Looking back now, I realise he probably loved me, but lacking the way to express it.

I have some other real stories happening at home when I grew up. Dad, my sister, and I, aren't sensitive to the paranormal but mom and my old maid both seem to be sensitive to odd things.

Poor Little Boy Spirit,"Ohio, United States",Photographs / Videos / EVP,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Photographs / Videos / EVP :: Poor Little Boy Spirit

H ello paranormal people. I know some people had a problem hearing my last video. SORRY. Here is another little story with evidence attached. Briefly, I am a 38 year old male, married and father of 3. I am very normal except for the family hobby of ""Ghost Hunting"". Recording is more like it. We frequent cemeteries and talk to the ""Residence"". I have learned a lot of tricks to doing this over time and we get fairly good results.

This little story is about what was captured in our van, leaving a small cemetery. My Grandparents are buried in this cemetery so we decided to record at their grave and throughout the graveyard as well. No luck at my Grandparents graves, but we got a good (but sad) capture in the van when we left. I would like to state that we have got quite a few EVP's in our vehicles leaving a cemetery. Just thought you might want to think about that the next time you visit uncle dead Fred... One of the questions that we always ask is if they have any messages from their side. You will hear in the Video, a little boy tell us ""I miss my dad"" in a kind of sad voice. This was recorded on 11-27-07 at about 8 or 9 PM.

I head this at home after reviewing the recordings. The next weekend, we returned and asked for his name. I thought if I could find his name and look up his family (if they were still among us), I would ask them to visit the cemetery (though that would be tough to explain). However, no luck on getting him again. I have tried several time since. I just thought this video / recording was pretty good proof that we keep on going, even after we die. Thought I would share. Note this is a Class A. Easy to hear without modifying. If you guys can't hear this one, email me and I will send you the wav file to hear.

Note, these are not hoaxes or jokes. I would gladly take a lie detector on any of my evidence. If you hoax, that takes away from the entire paranormal fields credibility. I will try and get another one on in the next few weeks if anyone is interested. I have some other REALLY good ones...

I Need Answers,Philippines,Psychic / Medium,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Psychic / Medium :: I Need Answers

I am sending this story so that I may be enlightened. When I was still in my 2nd year high school (SY 1987-88), I attended this summer camp which was organized by our rector of our school. It was held in Mindoro; an island part of the Philippines. It was a 2 days travel because we have to sleep over at an another sister school in Makati and have to move again the following day for the port of Batangas. From there we took this ferry boat bringing us to Calapan, Mindoro.

The island wasn't that developed yet. All around are lush green forest and coconut trees along the seashores. The road going to the camp, which is a major seminary, is still undeveloped.

When we arrived at the place, and our camp assistants had brought us to our designated barracks, which was infact a seminarians dormitory, I had this strong feeling that the place is so familiar. Especially when I passed by the assigned room for our rector, it seems that I had been there before.

To tell you frankly, that was the first time I stepped foot on that island so it is very unlikely that I am having deja vu. I immediately talked with our rector who was arranging things for the duration of the camping and asked him something that just came up from my vision. I asked him if that place originally belongs to a wealthy couple that lived before the Japanese war? Also if that couple had only one daughter and the room that he was using now was being used as a clinic during the Japanese invasion? And our rector looked at me straight in the eye and he said that was all true and how did I know all about it. I told him that from the moment that we stepped on the ground of the seminary I had this strange feeling, and a short vision at the same time that I have been in that place before and can still remember the same location of his room and the old piano in the basement.

He said that the place was donated by a couple who has been distraught because of the death of their only daughter, and who used to play that old piano.

Another instance happened here in Grand Cayman, Cayman Island last 2006. By the way, I just came here last Dec. Of 2005. Me and my friends were staying in an apartelle along the 7 Mile Beach. I was living on the 4th floor and they were staying on the second floor of the building. At that time it happened that my friends and I had the same days-off so I decided to spend the whole morning in their room. When we were hanging out, I was in my friends bed tinkering with her laptop, together with two other friends and the other preparing breakfast.  It occured again, this feeling and vision. This time it's not only vision but real time events. Strange thing is what we are doing, what we are saying, people in that room and the scenario are all familiar, as if it happened before and that what was happening was just a recollection of what has happened before.

I told them this and they just told me it was just deja vu. These occurances happen to me most of the time. The strange part about it is, it usually happens in a place that I haven't been to before.

To those who have read this, I am seeking your opinion so that I may understand better and fully appreciate this strange vision.

Pool Party,"Colorado, United States",Ouija Board / Seances,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Ouija Board / Seances :: Pool Party

W hen I was in high school my girlfriend of the time was having a b-day party at another friend's house. It was late, and we were about to leave when my girl brought out the Ouija Board.

We lit some candles and sat in the basement. In the room we were in you walk in the door and in the corner, right in front of the door is an ""L"" couch with a coffee table in the middle, and to the right is the tv. You walk to your right and there is a pool table and a mini bar in the far left corner. We sat where the coffee table was during this session.

I was on the board with a buddy and right away things were crazy and the planchette was moving very fast. I could feel many things around and there were many different spirits talking through the bored. We started to hear the pool table balls like a game was being played but no one was there and the balls were not moving. Then we would here drinks being poured but not a glass was on the bar.

My girlfriend, who was sitting to my right, grabbed me tight.  Then it felt like she let go but I was grabbed again. My buddy across from me had a blank face as he looked at me. Then I look to my right and nothing was there, but my shirt was tight as though being grabbed and I could still feel it. I moved and it went away as my girlfriend entered the room. She claimed she had left the room being scared but returned when I had not followed her into the room.

To this day I don't know what happened that night, but at times when I enter that basement I can feel a presence around me, and sometimes while watching movies something will be there like it is grabbing me. It is very friendly but after the presence leaves, I experience a feeling of anger and as though someone is watching me or mad at me.

I have since moved from that town and had other experiences of similar nature but those are other stories I shall share another time. If anyone can help me find out what might be an explanation, other than the obvious, it would be nice.

Night Time Visitor 2,"California, United States",Old Hags / Night Attacks / Sleep Paralysis,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Old Hags / Night Attacks / Sleep Paralysis :: Night Time Visitor 2

T his is a continuation of ""Night time visitor"", my first submission. This happened to me last night in my room.

After work, I came home thinking that I was going to take the advice of the others' who had commented on what I should do to rid myself of this thing that enters my room at night. But what I had in store wasn't on my agenda. I get home and go on the computer like I usually do, check my e-mail, myspace, etc. And everything was normal. It's probably about 1:30am at this point.

I get ready for bed and turn off the lights, and lay down to watch some tv before I close my eyes to try and fall asleep. Well... it didn't take long for the feeling to enter my room. It got really cold, and mind you, I live in Southern California. Yesterday's weather was really hot! My room got freezing cold and as I was thinking in my mind I needed to pray to my guardian angel Raphael, when all of a sudden, I see it. The haze returns and I am struggling to see through it to my closet! I wanted to make sure it wasn't just sleepy eyes. Well, I really didn't want this thing to come onto my bed at all so I decided to get the hell out of there and sleep in the living room. As I ran past the thing, I could've sworn I heard it laughing.

I fell asleep just fine. But it was my somewhat dream that freaked me out! I think it was a lucid dream, but I can't tell for sure so I'm just going to tell you what happened.

In my dream: I am laying in my bed sleeping (but I can see myself on the bed, as if I'm really sleeping, but I can see everything around me from a different part of the room), and all of a sudden I see the haze hovering from my closet to my bed. It's above me now and for some reason I can't yell at this thing to get off me from the other side of the room! Right when I see the blankets start to have the air sucked out of it, I am in my body again and I wake up on my bed with this thing staring at me. But at this point I know I'm in a dream but I can't wake up. So I feel like my chest gets so heavy, like a fat person sitting on me, and I feel absolutely paralyzed!

I can't move this time like I could before and I couldn't breathe! I was trying and trying to scream but all that could come out was a whisper, like I was dying or something because I was being crushed so badly. It scared me so bad! I don't know how long it lasted.  It could've been 10 seconds or 10 minutes! But it felt like too long. I finally wake up gasping and coughing for air, and I'm laying on the couch. I had to rub my head to find out what happened; if it really was a dream or not, and all of a sudden, I see that damn haze! It's floating away from me back to my room! I swear on my life this really happened to me! I'm not crazy or making this up! After that, I couldn't sleep for the longest time. I had to turn on all the lights in order to feel comfortable enough to lay there even.

I really don't know what to make of what happened last night... But is it possible that they can come into your dreams?

Can someone please help me?! I don't want to be attacked by this thing anymore.

A Ghost Hunt,United Kingdom,Ghost Hunting,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Ghost Hunting :: A Ghost Hunt

T his happened a couple of months ago. I study media at college and we got an assignment, which was to make a short 10 minute documentary about anything we wanted. Because my friends and I find the spirit world and all ghostly goings on really interesting, we decided that we would do our documentary on ghosts. We decided that we were too scared to spend a whole night in a proper cemetery but I knew of this place round the corner, which is a really old war memorial, but it has about 15 graves at the back of the memorial.

We had all our equipment, like camera and torch, and we wore really warm clothing just incase it rained (it's England after all). We got there about 8pm and it was already dark. After we plucked up the courage, we made our way to the graves at the back. We took a look round and you could just feel how creepy it was there.  My friend started to talk out loud to any spirits, saying that were not there to cause any harm. We made our way further up the back.  I was holding the camera so I had to lead the way. I stopped at a tomb-like grave and I was trying to read out to the camera some of the writing engraved.

My friend told me to go to the top of the tomb because it says when she died.  As soon as she said that, I heard a really loud moan in my ear, so I screamed and we all ran out. We were looking back over the tape and luckily the moan had come out because no one believed us. We showed our teacher the footage we had, and whilst looking closely, my teacher stopped the tape and zoomed in to where the tomb was and you can see a Victorian looking lady standing by the nearest tree, and a blue face in mid air. We zoomed in more and looked at other shots and there are faces in the walls and on the floor. We decided we had to go back and see if we could get anything else.  We took some candles this time and a digital camera to get a clearer picture.

We found some more faces and on one photo where a candle is resting on the tomb, if you zoom in you can see a clear face blowing at the candle! Also by the tree where the Victorian lady was standing is a solid white girl in a coat with a hood a little like Little Red Riding Hood's coat! I have not been back there since but we are planning to go again in a couple of weeks! I have pictures from the second ghost hunt on http://www.piczo.com/dontgetscared.

Gregory And The Dish Cloths,Canada,Poltergeists / Physical Manifestations,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Poltergeists / Physical Manifestations :: Gregory And The Dish Cloths

I have never really paid much attention to the paranormal. I wouldn't call myself a skeptic per se; more of a neutral third party. What happened last July changed my outlook on the subject forever.

It was about nine pm on a Tuesday night. My family was getting ready to go upstairs to bed. I was in the kitchen when I heard this really strange whining sound coming from the basement. I had never heard a noise like that before in my life.  I looked down the stairs and saw it was our chocolate lab, Hershey, making the noise. He was standing at the bottom of the stairs, staring into our laundry room making this awful sound. He was only about 8 months old at the time and the strange thing was we had never heard him bark before. Not once.  And now he was barking furiously, as if he was warning something off. Finally, fur standing on end and ears back against his head, he shot up the stairs and into the living room. My mother, who was in the kitchen said he must have been afraid of the washing machine. I didn't think so.

She asked me to take a couple dish cloths to the laundry room, and put them in the washer with the rest of the towels. I slowly walked down the stairs and looked in the dark room. I got these eerie chills down my arm.  There was no way I was going in there. I dropped the cloths at the bottom of the stairs and booked it back up into the kitchen.

I went upstairs to the second floor, and mostly forgot about what happened.  I didn't want to scare myself. At about eleven pm, I got so thirsty, I had to open my door and venture downstairs for a drink. I went out into the hallway, and noticed there were lights on downstairs. I assumed my mother couldn't sleep, so I went downstairs without any fear because I thought she was down there.

I got to the bottom of the stairs, and stepped in something wet. The hall light was on- strangely because it isn't a light you would turn on normally.  It's bright and only gets turned on when we have company leaving out the front door. The floor was wet with water- and all over the floor were these men's footprints; big ones, barefoot- they looked like my fathers. The living room was dark- no other lights were on. I walked into the kitchen, expecting to see my father fixing the sink or something. He wasn't there, but in the middle of the floor were the two dish cloths I had set at the bottom of the stairs. They were neatly spread out next to each other, and those wet footprints were everywhere. I looked towards the stairs and it seemed the footprints had come from there.

I still thought my mother or father MUST be down here somewhere. I called their names, silent at first, then louder. When no one answered I started to get a little freaked out so I called their names up the stairs. My father rushed down. I asked him if he'd been down here- no. I showed him the footprints. My mother called from upstairs and came down. Had she been down here? No. My father said little, and started searching the house. My parent's panic was beginning to scare me.  This wasn't a joke.

My father searched everywhere and found nothing. He even went outside to check the yard.  Nothing. The doors were still locked.  No one was there. The strange thing is sometimes when a member of the family is in the laundry room, they leave wet footprints around the house because the washer leaks. Whoever, or whatever left those tea towels came from our laundry room...

This was my very first encounter with Gregory; the man who lives in my laundry room. For more on his tragic, truthful death and more haunting, stay tuned.

The Shotgun Guy,"California, United States",Apparitions / Voices / Touches,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Apparitions / Voices / Touches :: The Shotgun Guy

I f you've read my other story it says something about 'The Shotgun Guy'. Well, I thought I'd explain it a little. Growing up I've always been able to sense stuff. I could sense when something was around me. Never could any of my friends, so when I was young I did learn I was a bit diffrent. But ever since my 13th birthday have I sensed The Shotgun Guy.

I suppose I should first explain what he looks like, so you can kind of imagine what I sense. He wears a brown flannel shirt, with blue trousers. He wears a hat so I can't exactly see what his hair color is. But the guy is around his 40s. He also carries a shotgun with him (Hence the name 'The Shotgun Guy'.).

Around where I live there is an old broken-down house. Holes in the roof, doors broken, windows broken or just completly gone, etc. I believe, no, I just know that he used to live there. I also know how The Shotgun Guy died. Behind our house is a little riverbed. A lot of people go there to hunt. That's how I believe he died. A hunting accident. Shot by his hunting buddy. Maybe that's why he doesn't want to pass on. Maybe he didn't feel like he lived a long enough life.

It's hard for me to explain how I know this. It's not like I've ever talked to him. But I just know. And I know I'm not paranoid, because it's never just him I sense. I've sensed other ghosts (or what ever you want to call them). But for some reason, I've never known anything about them. Only until I sensed The Shotgun Guy have I been sensing not just him, but a lot of ghosts.

I know he's not evil, I can just sense it. He lives in our front yard, or at least he's there a lot. Whenever I'm home alone I'll sense him in our backyard. He's always walking back and forth from our sliding glass window. Which scares me a bit because I'm always right next to our sliding glass window, on the computer. But not only do I sense him, when I'm on the computer looking at the screen, in the corner of my eye I'll see a shadow quickly pass by. I don't see him exactly, but I see some type of shadowy figure.

I've tried talking to my brother about this, but he just seems to ignore it or laugh in my face. Which is annoying. But he's never sensed The Shotgun Guy, only me. So now when I sense stuff I keep it from my family, because I'm afraid they might think I'm some freak.

I don't know why he's always outside. And I don't believe I've ever sensed him inside. But it's only at my house do I sense him. How weird is that? But do you think I'm just paranoid? Or do you think what I sense is real? I believe it's real. And I don't just want to ignore it, because The Shotgun Guy may just want to be remembered and never forgotten, or maybe he guards the house (would explain why no one has yet to ever break in), or maybe he's just trying to show himself to me because he knows I can sense him. All I know is that I'm at a total loss as to why I can sense him.

And one more thing, you may be a little confused as to why I say 'sense' instead of 'see'. But I've never exactly 'seen' him. I haven't seen him like I'm able to see other people. I can sense what he looks like and sense other stuff about him. I have seen small images of him. So I really don't think it's just me being paranoid.

If you have any ideas as to why I'm sensing him, please, I'll listen to everything. Or if you just think I'm paranoid, well that's okay too, everyones allowed to think what they wish.

The 8th Floor,"California, United States",Apparitions / Voices / Touches,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Apparitions / Voices / Touches :: The 8th Floor

I just recently read a story that was somewhat similiar to mine. So I thought I'd share with you my story.

When I was younger I had some health problems. Only once did I ever have to stay a few days in the hospital. When I was 10 I was sent to the hospital. When I was in the hospital I met this girl named Isabella. She was a year older then me. By the end of the first day, we became great friends.

So the next day Isabella and I spent the day together. We visited all the floors (I forget how many, but at least 10 or so). Every floor except one. One of the nurses told us to stay away from floor 8. So, of course, as small kids, when we were told to stay away from something, it only made us want to see it more.

That day we stayed away from the floor. But in the middle of the night (around 3am), I woke up. I didn't know the rules of the hospital, so I'd thought it'd be fine if I got up and went to see Bella (my nickname for her). So I got up and left the room. I went into the elevator and hit floor 4 (or so, I can't exactly remember what floor she was on, but I knew back then).

So the elevator started to go up. Now I was only suppose to go to up 1 or 2 floors. But it felt a little longer then that. So I looked up and I noticed I was higher than floor 4. I was already to floor 6, and the elevator kept going until I hit floor 8. When I hit floor 8 the doors to the elevator opened. I wasn't really scared, I just thought I may have hit 8 instead of 4 by accident.

I was going to hit the button to go back down to floor 4, but then I remembered that the lady said not to go to floor 8. So, of course, I get out of the elevator and started to walk slowly down the halls. There were no lights on in this floor. It looked like a very old floor. Kind of broken-down. Possibly renovations, I didn't know.

So I take one turn in the hallway and I hear this voice. And I remember very clearly what it said. ""Hello!"" Is what the voice yelled. Now, this was not a nurse's voice. This was a little girl's voice. Like 6 or 7. Now you'd think that'd be creepy? No. I just thought that maybe a girl came out of her room or something. Sure, the hair on the back of my neck was standing, but that was only because the girl startled me.

So I turn around and I see no one. I thought ""Hey, maybe she left..."" So I looked around the corners. Nope. No one. Here comes the very creepy part. I hear this faint laughter. It sounded like the girl. But if it were day time and there were people walking about, you'd think ""Hey, what cute laughter..."" No. It was just me. And it scared me half to death.

So then I decided I'd go back to my room. I headed straight to the elevator. I kept hitting the button to go down. The doors opened and I ran in and hit button 2. The floor I believe I was staying on. When I finally get to floor 2, I hear the girls voice again. I remember very clearly what she said. ""Let's play tomorrow...""

Of course, I ran straight to my room, got under my covers, and stayed there the rest of the night.  Now you may think this story isn't scary, but I was only 10. Walking in those halls full of complete darkness. And I've never told anyone about my experience there. Not even Isabella (who I never played with again when I left the hospital). I never walked those halls again, heck, I never went into that elevator again. I'm now a stairs person. Amen for stairs!

This happened 3 years ago. To this day that girls voice freaks me out. I only went into that hospital one other time, to visit my Auntie. Same hospital. But when the lady said my Auntie was staying on floor 8, I quickly got out of the hospital. I knew I wasn't welcomed there. And I knew the girl didn't want me there. I never stepped foot in that hospital again. You could offer me a thousand dollars and I wouldn't go back on that floor.  Never walk the floors so late. And always listen to the nurses. God bless you all!

New Occurance At College St,"North Carolina, United States",Apparitions / Voices / Touches,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Apparitions / Voices / Touches :: New Occurance At College St

I promised to keep posted on any new activity in my haunted apartment. I have, as usual seen shadows here and there. There hasn't been any more sleep paralysis, maybe because as a new parent I am hardly getting sleep, but all joking aside, I have a few new experiences. But first I would like to post an experience I thought I had included in the other story but didn't.

When I got home from the hospital with Christopher, I began seeing a young man in the hall. It was always in peripheral vision. It was in the place of where I used to see a shadow of a human figure, now I am getting this apparition. I have seen him ever since, and he looks a whole heck of a lot like Jeff. I don't know if this is a doppelganger, or just a coincidence that a ghost happens to look like my honey!

On June 11th/12th it was pretty late maybe 1am, and I had just gotten done folding some laundry. The baby was sleeping in his bassinet, and I was watching a movie coming on. Jeff had gone to sleep just before I tackled the laundry. I had just kicked back to relax and see what movie was playing, when I heard foot steps. At first I thought it was Jeff. Then I remembered he had gone to bed maybe an hour earlier. I continued to listen and realized that they sounded like the footsteps of a small child, that of maybe a five year old. Then it sounded like something fell where the foot steps sounded from and then the steps stopped as if the person had stopped to pick up what they dropped, and then they just ceased. When I got up for a drink, I looked around the area for something that could have fallen but there was nothing there.

Something else happened the following Saturday, the 14th. It involved my oldest cat who seems to have wandered off and never returned. I am having awful luck with cats in this place! I had been at the lake all day with the baby, my sister, and some friends. When I came back, my little guy was all tuckered out and fell asleep after his bath and feeding. So I decided to get some dishes done. As I stood in the kitchen, my cat Puck was rubbing my legs. I reached down to pet him, and I hear the distinct sound of Pooh kitty's meow. Puck turned around and started tracking something I couldn't see in the dining room.

Since that night, at least once a day I have heard Pooh kitty's meow. I am so upset he is gone. I had taken him for stolen, or maybe even he chose to live somewhere quieter as he hates noise and babies are loud. But now I wonder maybe he did get hurt and die? Who knows! I do really feel though that Pooh had protected me from ghosts in a way. A lot of times something would be starting to happen, or already happening paranormally, he would show up and the activity would stop. Same with my old cat Muffin, and before Pooh, there was Lynk, before Lynk, Metalica.

Can cats ward off spiritual attack, and if so, could there be something targeting my cats to get to me? What do you think?

4:00 Am Visitor,"New York, United States",Apparitions / Voices / Touches,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Apparitions / Voices / Touches :: 4:00 Am Visitor

A little while after my daughter was born, in June of 2006, I believe she started to get a ""visitor"" about once a week. I would be asleep in my bedroom, she in her crib in her room which is at the other end of the hall. I would be sound asleep and all of a sudden her baby monitor would get static. Not the regular static which it often gets, loud and annoying, but rather a softer, almost pulsing sound. Then I would hear her start to moan, or move around, annoyed like something was bothering her. I would get a horrible feeling of pressure around me as if it were holding me down to my bed so as to visit her undisturbed.

This went on for months, always between 4:00 am and 5:00 am. I always felt it could be either my Grandmother or Grandfather, both of whom passed away right before she died. My Grandfather had accidentally run over my Grandmother and she died that night. Then, obviously he could not live with the grief and I believe he killed himself by not eating. He died 6 months later in December 2005. My daughter was born six months after that.

Eventually as she grew and could speak, I would hear her say ""Hello"" and some of her toys would go off on their own. Still the noise on the monitor. It reached a fever pitch when one night I was awakened by what I thought was my alarm going off (It is set for the radio) so I thought I heard the radio. Then as I truly awoke, I realized it was not the radio but seemed to be static in my head. Again I felt like something was pinning me to my bed. I could not move. All of a sudden I felt a poke in my side. I turned my head, expecting it to be my cat, but nothing was there. I couldn't move. I was paralyzed with fear. Eventually I was able to turn on the TV and the light and stayed awake the rest of the night.

I should say two other things. My husband is a cop and he works over nights some nights, and this always seemed to happen when he was not home. So he thinks I am crazy. Also, I happened to be researching and writing an exhibit for our local Historical Society about the restoration of our old gravestones. I had been exploring several graveyards up and down New England for the past 2 years.

I told my mother all about these visitors, since the beginning. She came to visit me in March. The first night she slept over in the guest room which is next to my daughter's room. She told me in the morning that she was ""shoved"" in the back 3 times in the early morning. (My grandparents were her parents).

So, I have a few questions... Who is coming? I believe it or they are not harmful, just visiting us because they are checking up on us, more importantly my daughter. Could it be my Grandparents or someone from the graveyard?

I had a miscarriage in January and then began having fainting spells, panic attacks, and an unexplained pressure in my head and ears, and nightmares in the middle of the night. Could this be related to a spiritual visit? I have been to so many doctors and they all say nothing is wrong with me. My friend said she read that these symptoms could be the result of spirits. Has anyone else had these symptoms or ever hear of this? The visits continue. I have never worked up the nerve to go in her room while I felt someone was there.

I know they are not there to do harm, so I just let them visit, but if they are causing me these symptoms, perhaps I should confront it. Any suggestions as how to do this? Thank you for listening

Urban Legend Or Prank?,Australia,Poltergeists / Physical Manifestations,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Poltergeists / Physical Manifestations :: Urban Legend Or Prank?

W arning: You may want to read this in the morning, but whatever, it's up to you, because this may be supernatural or may not be...

Well after reading that starting sentence, you're all going to go ""oh this story is such bull.""

Well believe what you believe, because this event had effected both me and my cousin.

It started Saturday (07/06/08).  Instead of babysitting we were house sitting my grandma's house because everyone went off to a ""Timorese Party"" (its soo boring - its fun when you're a kid, cause you get to run around, but when you're older...yeah) anyways, we didn't mind. Besides, my Grandma and uncle, aunty and baby cousin would be home by 10:00pm because obviously my Grandma doesn't like to stay out late; also they had Foxtel (To you Americans - Cable T.V) which was great because we were watching a variety of shows to keep us entertained.

It was around 7:00pm when the phone rang, I went to go pick it up; No answer, saying out loud ""Damn prankers."" - ""Who was that?"" my cousin asked. ""No one"" I replied. So I decided to go make dinner (instant noodles YUUM!). While eating dinner the phone rang.  As I placed my plate down on the table and walked towards the phone it stopped ringing. I sighed and went back to eating my dinner and watching T.V. It was around 8:00pm we started getting bored. ""You should have brought your Wii!"" My cousin said - ""You should have brought your 360,"" I said back with sarcasm. After sitting on the couch with nothing to watch for like 30 minutes FINALLY something good comes on. So sitting there talking and watching T.V., the phone rings again, as I got up I stated; ""I swear to God if this is another prank I'm going to freaken track down the number"" - I picked up the phone ""Hello?!"" - No Answer, then breathing ""oh my god..."" I said in frustration -""What?"" my cousin asked - So I started making sex noises - you know to prank back the pranker, I guess - they hung up.

As I was about to sit down the phone rang ""arrrggh!"" My cousin started laughing - I picked up the phone (hysterical laughter was on the other line) so I laughed back but with the Krusty the clown laugh... After a few seconds I remembered about the urban legend. I hung up the phone and walked over to my cousin ""I think Yu ngin ga ho vue-kah"" (I think there's someone in the house) ""What?"" my cousin said with laughter in his reply - Gao tung ngai"" (just play along with me) I said with a serious voice and look ""Nyi jing-sik heimor?"" (You're serious aren't you?) replied a very worried cousin.

""Ahh damn, I got no more smokes - I'm going to drive to the shops, I'll be back later or do you want to come to?"" I said, sort of loudly (I don't smoke by the way).

""Hahaha! Nah I'll come too, I want to buy some starbursts,"" replied my cousin, who was just eager to get out of the damn house...

As we went out and locked the door, we heard a thump from inside.  We both quickly ran to my car.  I sort of had trouble putting the keys in the ignition due to fear.  I finally got it in, turned on the car and floored it. As we were at the shops my cousin asked me if we should call the cops and call our uncle.  I replied saying that it may just be our imagination and we should just go back but not go inside the house.

So we drove back to the house. ""Did you turn on the light upstairs?"" I said with my heart pounding really fast like it was going to bust out.

""No... But doesn't Den (my 4 year old cousins' name but I shortened it - you know, privacy) have an auto nightlight?"" my cousin replied back, but I could tell he was getting freaked out as much as I was.

""Oh yeah..."" as I was about to unlock the car - ""WAIT!"" my cousin shouted. ""Start the damn car and get of here!"" Without questioning I started the car again and headed to my cousins house. While driving there I asked him what he saw.  He said he saw a person's figure going pass the window.  When I heard that it sent chills down my spine; I have never been so afraid.

So I stopped the car and I decided to call the operator.  I asked if any outgoing calls have been made from the phone.  She said ""no"" so I asked, has any incoming calls been made to my grandmas phone number? She asked for a timeframe - I said from 7pm-9pm.  She said ""no, no calls have been made to the requested number.""  I said, ""are you sure? Because I've had a series of prank calls"" - she apologised and said no again and repeated the number I told her. I said thanks and hung up.

It was around 10:10pm and I realised that my grandma was going to be home soon.  I got a call from my mum. ""Your grandma is going to be home at 11 so you and Kenneth (not my cousins real name) can go to his house if you want.""

""Don't ask, but someone keeps pranking us and when we left the house and locked the door, me and Kenneth both heard a 'thump' and we ran to the car.""

I hear my mum talking to my uncle about what I just told her.

""Well stay there and after 30 minutes, drive to grandma's house.""

So not waiting 15 minutes I drove to my grandma's house but I didn't park in front of her house.  I parked at the second house in front of her house. Anyways, the nightlight was still on and I saw what my cousin saw before.  At that point I was about to cry - (I was thinking that whoever it is, would just jump next to my car - you get the point). I called the police and they said they'll be there within 30 - 40 minutes and to keep calm and keep a good distance from the house. So waiting in the car for what seemed like hours, my uncle arrived. I beeped at him.  He stopped his car in front of mine. We got out and I was so relieved.  We talked. I told him that I called the operator and she said that there were no incoming calls, and that I saw a persons figure go across Den's window.

The cops finally arrived - like 5 of them. 1 was outside talking with me and my cousin and the other 4 went inside the house.  After waiting they all came out.

""Did any of you leave the window opened?"" asked one of the cops.

Everyone said no and my uncle said which room had the window opened. The cop described the room and it was my aunt's room, so my uncle called his little sister asking if she had left her window opened.  He hung up and said that she said she doesn't know.

The cop then said that, they can't do anything about it and that it could have just been a prank, but if anything out of the ordinary happens, then immediately call the police (duh).

As they were about to go I told them to wait. I told them about the call I made to the operator, and they said it's impossible for a call not to show up.  I said, well I've been getting prank calls and that when I called they said that no incoming calls have been made to my Grandma's house. The cop looked worried and suspicious and decided to call the phone company.  They said exactly the same thing, and they decided to do a second search around my grandma's house, backyard - everywhere. They came out with a piece of eaten bun and I thought to myself... Wow, searching must be hard work.

They asked if I dropped this under the table. I said that we didn't even eat that.  We had noodles. EVERYONE looked worried and I was so scared.

The cops decided to put my grandma's house under constant surveillance.

After a few days, nothing has happened. So what was it?  A sick prank? Supernatural? Or some sick psycho decided to reinact an urban legend? - I might think it was supernatural, since if it wasn't supernatural there would be a trace of the incoming calls right?

Sleepover,Canada,Poltergeists / Physical Manifestations,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Poltergeists / Physical Manifestations :: Sleepover

A s I mentioned in the previous post I had a fateful sleepover in my paranormally active home.

I was brave enough when I was 13 to tell my best friend Susan about the strange goings-on in my home. There was something about talking about it to a sympathetic ear that made me feel better as my family often dismissed what I told them. Susan was equally fascinated and terrified by the stories but believed me as best friends do for one another.

Being 13 year old girls our conversations revolved more around boys and gossip than the supernatural. And being a normal 13 year old girl I invited her for a sleepover. I really, really didn't think anything was going to happen. The occurences weren't daily and I think a part of me really wanted to believe it was all my vivid imagination.

We slept in the downstairs, partially built family room so we could stay up to all hours and giggle without keeping anyone up. The family room had walls built but cement floor littered with toys and clothes, books etc. We also had a ping-pong table that wasn't used anymore, just collected toys and folded laundry.

It was a normal sleepover. We stayed up late then decided to go to sleep. It was perhaps under an hour after we had turned the lights out and the sound of rolling ping pong balls started at one end of the basement where the laundry room was. They sounded like they were getting closer and closer but never came into the room. All I could think was ""not tonight, please not while my best friend is here."" I was embarassed of all things as only teenagers can be. Susan was whispering ""Are you awake? Do you hear that?"" and we both hid under the covers. It lasted for quite some time, or at least seemed to. I would say at least a few minutes. But the best/worst part is we didn't have any ping-pong balls! Our dog chewed any we did have leaving them useless and the game had lost it's appeal to us long before so we never replaced the balls.

When we discussed it the next morning I pointed out to Susan that we had no ping-pong balls I thought she was going to lose it. It was just too freaky for her and me! Word went around school pretty fast about the night and I didn't have a sleepover again. Some kids were even scared of me!

Now that many years have gone by and I've had a chance to research a bit I think it may have been poltergiest activity. Lots of energy from teens, and already susceptable environment and expectation? I don't really know. Anyone have any thoughts?

Grandma Visits,"California, United States",Family / Friends Visits,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Family / Friends Visits :: Grandma Visits

M y grandma passed away 10 years ago and I have thought about her everyday since. I have had dreams of her that were all of similar nature but I had never really felt her presence. The other night while laying in bed I was thinking about her and decided to ""in my head"" say grandma, please come to me and if you are here give me a sign.  Literally a second later I heard one knock on the secretary that was hers that I have in my room next to my bed.

Last night I again was laying in bed and said, grandma, please come visit and give me a sign.  I then heard what sounded like a coffee cup being set down on the counter or kitchen table. My children were in the room.  My son yelled out, mom are you in the kitchen? I say no.  He says, is dad? I say no. A few minutes after this I heard footsteps down the hall by the kitchen.  My son came running down the hall, looked at my husband who was asleep, and then at me and said mom who is in the kitchen? I heard ""he says"" a bowl and then someone walking around. I felt good that he heard this as well knowing that I didn't make the sounds up in my head. I told him its grandma Frankie.

Today I decided to text my friend to let her know my experience.  My phone was fine until after I sent the text. For the rest of the day today I would get a pic of me on my phone with a white background.  It would just pop up every 20 minutes or so until my phone died.

Last night I felt really light and airy kind of a sense of relief and today I felt pretty good. I haven't been feeling good for the last couple years due to a pain disorder.  Last night was the first night I haven't had pain in a long time.

Ghost Or Spirit In The Sky,"Alabama, United States",Photographs / Videos / EVP,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Photographs / Videos / EVP :: Ghost Or Spirit In The Sky

M e and my friend Kent were in the Wiregrass Commons Mall parking lot in Dothan, AL sometime around the end of July last year. It was a bad storm, and I was trying to capture lightening on my cell phone. Next thing I know, this light flies across the sky. My first reaction was shock. I didn't know what to think. I checked my phone and sure enough... I actually got this thing on video.

Not moments later an ambulance pulls in right next to us (which is linked to the video of the ""light"" on youtube). We looked over at the Dillard's lobby, and there was a man laying face up on the floor with a few people knelt down beside him. I don't know to this day what happened to that man, but all the coincidences led me to believe that it was either his spirit/ghost going up to heaven, or his guardian angel leaving from his side.

It is truly an amazing experience, and I would like to share it with as many people as possible. Thanks a lot for reading. The video is linked in my profile. I hope ya'll enjoy. Can't wait to hear back from you!

Was It The Shadow Man?,United Kingdom,Poltergeists / Physical Manifestations,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Poltergeists / Physical Manifestations :: Was It The Shadow Man?

W hen I was about 6, we had just moved into our new house and of course I was very excited! The area we lived in was the same area that my best friend used to live in when she was younger. It was not the same house but I was very excited. The first night was a bit weird.  I had the smallest room in the house because I was the youngest. My brother loved to scare me, so he thought it would be funny to tell me that a shadow man lived in my room.

I was in bed.  It was about 10:30 and it was quite late for me then, considering I was only 6. I kept tossing and turning and no matter what I did I just couldn't get comfy. I closed my eyes and started seeing blue shapes just letting my mind help me drift off, but then I saw black, full blackness and I thought of my brothers shadow man story. I opened my eyes and looked over towards my wardrobe.  There was a young boy, middle teens I would say. He had scruffy hair and baggy jeans and a t-shirt.  He had a cap that covered half of his face.  His arm covered the rest. I thought it was my brother playing a trick so I threw my teddy bear at him. He looked up and removed his arm.  I was frozen with fear as I saw his face. Well, the thing is there was no face; just a huge hole in the middle, and peeling skin round the outside.

What looked like black smoke was coming out of the hole. I was frozen in fear. I blinked once and he was sitting back at my wardrobe. Squeezing my eyes as tightly together as I could I somehow managed to get back to sleep. When I awoke the next morning the Teddy bear was on the floor next to my wardrobe, and when I asked my brother about the shadow man he told me he had made it up. My best friend came round the next day and told me it was probably my imagination.

A few weeks ago (I am now 13), I was having a sleep-over with one of my friends, Emma. We were telling ghost stories and went to sleep about 4 in the morning.  I awoke at 5:30, and it was pitch black. I turned over to face my wardrobe and saw what looked like smoke, but it was not thick.  It was 2d, like shadows of smoke. I just forgot it and went back to sleep.

Ghost Child,"New Jersey, United States",Apparitions / Voices / Touches,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Apparitions / Voices / Touches :: Ghost Child

I n the early 70's my husband, child and I moved to an apartment that was provided by his employer. The property consisted of 3 houses and several greenhouses. The business was a wholesale florist. The apartment was over the oldest house (the owners grandparents). It was a cute apartment and worked well with my small family. But for some reason I always felt uneasy at night and liked to keep a light on when going to sleep. Many times when visiting the mother of the owner (she was in the 3rd house) I would tell her of my creepy feelings and asked if there were any deaths in that house and she couldn't remember any.

In  '72 I had my second child while living there and being busy with 2 children I was too tired at night to dwell on my feelings. But a year after my 2nd child was born, my marriage was in trouble and I found myself sleeping on the couch. I stayed up late, reading or watching television and when I could finally fall asleep, I made sure a light was on because a few times when I turned off the tv and the room got dark, I would start to feel fearful.

The final year of living in this apartment I had one experience. I had fallen asleep while watching tv and for a brief moment I woke up and shut it off. I drifted back to sleep only to be wakened by my son. ONLY it wasn't my son because just as I said to this child standing next to my head, Karl what are you doing out of bed, the child vaporized right before my eyes. Poof into thin air, I quickly turned on the light and after I calmed down, I was able to get back to sleep.

I also remember one time before I started sleeping on the couch, I was asleep in the bedroom and my husband got up early to go hunting and he woke me up to say goodbye. I didn't feel the need to turn a light on as it was early morning, but it was before the sun was up so the house was dark. Unfortunately right after he left, that feeling came over me again and I jumped out of bed and turned on the closest light.

I never did find out who this little boy was or why I felt so creeped out in this apartment, and other than that one episode I did not see any evidence of ghosts or a haunting.

My Name Being Whispered,"Florida, United States",Apparitions / Voices / Touches,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Apparitions / Voices / Touches :: My Name Being Whispered

W ell, this post is one of a few that I am willing to share (as it says in my bio). It's not too long, though. These were two similar incidents, so I'm going to put them into one short story.

This wasn't my first experience, but one of the most memorable ones because I was older and I don't think my imagination was as over active as it was when I was little and thinking I was seeing random movements in the old houses I used to live in. Anyways, it was fall and school had just started. We were about a month or two into the school year at this time and I was standing out by the bus stop.

Let me set the tone for you a little bit here. I'm from southern Georgia, born and raised in a very small town called Naylor. I had moved right across the state line into Jennings, Florida about two or three years prior. We were still the ""new family"" and were still getting used to the neighbors and everything. I lived in a small subdivision of dirt roads and randomly placed houses. We only had two neighboring houses that were in eye's view. One was directly across the road facing our house along the main road, in which no one lived  because they were still clearing off that land and hadn't dug their well yet to get proper plumbing. And then there was the house next to that on the left (if you're looking from my house) where my friend, Zane, lived.

So there I was. I was about 5:45 in the morning and I was the early one to the bus stop, patiently waiting for the bus for school. It was a little bit chilly outside considering it was autumn and all. I looked at my watch and it was around 5:50 or so. I heard a door shut and turned around see my boy, Zane, about 200-250 yards away, heading over my way. As I turned in that direction facing the empty lot across the street awaiting my boy, I felt a slight breeze blow past me and heard my name called in a very soft voice (maybe a female's voice?), ""Chrissssssss."" At that moment, I tried to follow the leaves blowing in the breeze. Now, normally you see the leaves just roll all the way through the yard 'cause a gust or breeze doesn't just stop, right? They blow just past my body and fall to the ground about 15 feet in front of me.

Being freaked out by what had just happened, I turned around really quick to see if it could have been my sister playing tricks on me. I mean, she's only a year younger than I am and we play games on each other all the time and still do to this day.

So when I turned around, she was just leaving the house, too. So I was just kind of frozen and I just stood there in some type of shocked state until my sibling and friend got there. I never shared this with anyone until now.

The second account was a little weirder because I was completely alone. It happened a little less than a year after the other incident.

It was now summer and I was on my way home from my best friend Jimmy's house after having an afternoon full of backyard football and us literally beating the hell out of one another ('cause we actually played tackle football with no pads or anything). So, I was on my way home, it was almost dark, and the sun had already gone down. Jimmy lives about a mile from me and he was the closest neighbor that was south from my house. So, there I was again walking down a heavily brushed dirt road and I heard it again, ""Chrissssss"". It was the soft female voice. By now I'm walking a little faster looking around for a person or being of some sort. Then, I heard it once more and I began sprinting all the way until I made it home.

I never really told anyone expect for my ex girlfriend and she sees things. I have a few stories with her to share with you which will come later. Any comments or advice is welcome. Don't be too harsh on critiquing this as this is the first time I've actually written these experiences down.

3rd Shift  Same Hospital,"Ohio, United States",Apparitions / Voices / Touches,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Apparitions / Voices / Touches :: 3rd Shift  Same Hospital

W ell, I said that I had more to tell so here's another one for you all to ponder about.

I worked 2nd shift for almost seven months.  It was actually a terrible shift due to trying to have a life outside of work. 3pm to 11pm, 5 days a week was really taking a toll on my free time. So I asked about and accepted a 3rd shift position. Three 12 hour shifts. 6pm to 6am. I knew that switching like that was going to be a life style change but with 3 days on and 4 days off I was willing to try it out for a while.

One night again I left to go outside for a ""smoke break.""  This time it was almost midnight, and I had already had an awkward feeling since the beginning of the shift. I walked the 10th floor first to see if I could find a nurse or a tech to go out with me, but the ones who smoked seemed to have already taken their breaks, or were just too busy with new admit patients to go out then. So again by myself, I got in the elevator and headed to the first floor. The ride down was fine, nothing exciting seemed to happen.

I walked the long dark hall ways, past the cafeteria, and the gift shop. I made my way through the ER, headed toward the only ""night exit."" As I started to pass the security station, the guard stopped me, and asked ""where did the nurse you were walking with go?""  A little unsure by what he was asking, I told him that I had been alone since I left the 10th floor. Then he told me that on the security cameras he saw me exit the elevator with a nurse wearing a white dress, and a small hat on her head. I said maybe that was someone else that got off the elevator close to the time I did, and he assured me that it was me that he saw, and he even pointed out how I stopped in front of the gift shop and looked into the window for a quick second.

A little surprised I said ""maybe she was a ghost nurse,"" and I let out a little chuckle. He laughed thinking I was joking, and he said that he was only curious because he had not seen any one dressed in clothes she was wearing before, and that as I entered the back way into the ER and then came into the waiting area that he thought he would be able to see her in her attire in person. I sort of shrugged my shoulders and told him that I had indeed been by myself, and that I wished that I could have seen what he thought he saw. He motioned for me to come behind the booth, and he (in front of me) rewound the tape in the recorder, and played it back for me from the time I got off the elevator.

On the tape no nurse was present, but there was a lightly glowing object of what appeared to be the shape of slimly built human, and it stayed with me walking the same pace I walked through the trip, even as I stopped at the gift shop. The man was freaking out telling me that he knows what he saw and that the glowing object was the nurse. That she was walking with me right in it's place.

So, I don't really know, but believing in what I do I can't say that she wasn't there, and the glowing affirmation if you will, was certainly there. I never feel like I'm alone there. But as long as there is no harm to me I don't mind too much.

I would love to hear what you all think about this encounter. All input's appreciated. Thank you, and GOD BLESS.

Fun Ghost That We Brought Home,"Maryland, United States",Orbs / Lights / Mists,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Orbs / Lights / Mists :: Fun Ghost That We Brought Home

I am from and still live in Cockeysville, which is in the northern part of Baltimore County, Maryland. Our house was built in 1872 and is one of the only still existing houses from the Village of Warren, a cotton milling town, which was flooded in the early 1920's to create Loch Raven Reservoir. Loch Raven is a man made lake for Baltimore City's water supply.

About seven years ago my friend Jill, an RN at Johns Hopkins Hospital, and I were bored and wanted to try something new. We decided to go ghost hunting. So we researched haunted sights / ghost in Maryland and found a lots of information about Rocks State Park in Harford County, Maryland, which is relatively close by. We went there late one evening, around 2 a.m., and parked near the bridge in the pictures we found online. At some point I hit the brake pedal, which lit up the guard rail next to the car, and these waves of what looked like heat rolling off of asphault went past the car like shadows. Then it got cold and Jill said that she felt like she was being shocked. She became scared and upset, so we made the decision to leave.

Two weeks or so later we went back, and this time saw a sign we had missed before that read, ""LaGrange Iron Works, circa 1732,"" and decided to investigate. As I attempted to back the car into the driveway, downhill I might add, it seemed like there was something pushing against the car. I actually recall having to push the gas pedal rather hard. Anyway, I parked. After about 15 minutes or so similar things happened with the cold and the electrical shocks, but this time I felt it too. At this point we both got all freaked out and abruptly decided it was once again time to roll out.

On the way home, as cars came toward us, I would see one or two of these ""ORBS"" in the upper right-side corner of the windshield, illuminated by their headlights. They were like a four inch circles with a squiggly inner circles and cloudy grayish centers. I pointed them out to Jill and she got even more freaked out. When I got back home I went in and smoked some weed to chill out. (I know, I know, blah, blah, blah...)

The next day I woke up and went to smoke up again. When I went to sleep the night before, I left the last bit of herb I had on top of my cigarettes and crashed. When I woke up, I looked for my stash, and it was gone. I thought my friends Todd and Dennis had stolen my stuff, so I called them to give them a hard time. I lit a smoke and went into the bathroom. When I came out, alone in the house or so I thought, I sat down and the weed was exactly where I had left it the night before. Right on top of my cigarette pack. The pack I had to pick up and open to smoke a cigarette before going to the bathroom. Now the stash had returned on it's own, and was back on top of the pack on the table.

Around this time we were doing major renovations to the house and I had a friend named Ronnie helping me with some demolishion work. It was hot so he went to make a glass of instant iced tea. He sat the tea mix can down, and filled the glass with water. Then he returned to put the can away and like magic it had moved itself to the other side of the kitchen. These were just the first two times I had noticed.

Now... I figure this. The LaGrange Iron Works, was a foundry from 1732 until somewhere in the 1900's when it burned down. Back then there were no child labor laws and I am sure that at some point children probably died in accidents (hopefully accidents) while working at the iron works. The picture which originally caught our attention had several of these ""ORBS"" on top of this steel bridge over the Gunpowder Falls.

My guess is that we brought a couple of these little kid ghosts home with us and that they were pranksters. After a few weeks of these crazy things going on around my house I announced to them that I was going back to Rocks State Park, and if they wanted to go home that they should get back into the car. My parent's, my girlfriend and I drove back to the place where it all started and opened the door to let them out.

However, I don't think that they went home, but I do think that they bounce from my parents house to my girlfriends house via our car with us. I feel like this because stuff always happens at both houses at different times. If things are happening at my parent's house, they're not at our house and vice-versa.

I'm sure that this sounds like a whole lot of craziness and is pretty far fetched, but it is what's going on and has been now for years. It is still happening although not as frequently, or maybe we are just use to it now.

The ghosts or spirits or whatever you would call them are not trying to hurt people and do not do scary things, and certainly seem to be enjoying themselves since they have not decided to leave us. They just seem to be playing and loving life in our homes. It's like they are pulling off simple practical jokes. The latest has been a series of audio / video / phone movings and electrical issues.

First... Everyone loses remotes and cordless phones, but our ghosts take the phones and put them back on the chargers and put the remotes on tops of the components which they work. I NEVER keep the phone on it's base or remotes on the equipment which they operate.

Second, there is this outlet in my parent's kitchen which is messed up. If I don't have a blender or coffee pot or some other appliance plugged into it, then my microwave which is on a completely different curcuit breaker, won't work. Unplug the blender, microwave dies.

Finally, we have a new puppy. A miniture Shih Tzu which freaks out for no apparent reason other than that she sees the things moving. She must, because when we find things out of place it is in-step with our puppy going nuts. It's like when Dalhi, our puppy goes off, something is changing in the room. This usually happens while we are sleeping and she wakes us up.

I have really actually come to like our supernatural friends. It took a little while to figure it out, and additional time to get use to, but now they are like family. They do piss us off sometimes when we're in a hurry and they have moved our shoes, or one shoe, but we almost always plan a little extra time into everything we do just in case. My parents, however, are not as receptive and I think they just wish that they would go away.

Oh, one last note or question perhaps... How do I figure out if they are boys or girls?...and I know that there are at least two of them, but how do I figure out just how many there actually are?

Four Dark Figures Watching Me,"Florida, United States",Apparitions / Voices / Touches,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Apparitions / Voices / Touches :: Four Dark Figures Watching Me

M y story begins when I was attending school in Fort Lauderdale about two and a half years ago. I'm 28 years old now, so around that time I was 26 years old. I was living alone and I was very much used to being by myself. One afternoon I came home and I felt a little tired, so I decided to lie down on my couch (on my back, something I never do). The television was off and my neighborhood was extremely quiet, it always has been. I got up and turned my ceiling fan on.  I laid back down there on my back and the only sound I could hear was the sound of the ceiling fan on high.

It was at this point I felt it I was in a state of being between asleep and awake. Suddenly the noise from the ceiling fan sounded different, like distorted, it had just suddenly changed and I found that to be quite strange. I then saw four dark figures standing in the front of my couch. I could not make out any facial features, they were a black mass and I could just see their black shapes. I was terrified and at this point I tried to move to get up and I couldn't move. I tried to yell and I couldn't yell. I couldn't even move a finger even just a little. My focus was fixated on the three that were standing directly in front of me but one of them was off to the side. He seemed to be sitting and writing on something, which I found very strange.

I had overcome my fear of these beings a few moments later because I realized if they wanted to harm me they would have already done so, they just stood there watching me. I wanted to ask them what they wanted from me, but as a mentioned before I could not talk, nor move, I was helpless. I wondered who were these beings and why was one of them writing stuff down? I never found the answers to these questions to this day. A few seconds later I found myself still looking in their direction but now they were gone and the sound from the ceiling fan returned back to normal. I know within my heart, within myself that this was no dream. It was very real. During this experience I just felt as if they were observing me which I also found to be very strange.

Does anyone have any insight on what this experience was all about?

Child Psychic,"Pennsylvania, United States",Psychic / Medium,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Psychic / Medium :: Child Psychic

A s a very young child, I would often see ghosts wandering about the house and historical grounds of the large 19th century farmhouse in which my family lived. I would awake in the middle of the night to see them sitting beside my bed, and I would have screaming fits that brought my parents in to the room, often to spank me for poor behavior.

As I became older and began to understand what I was seeing, I grew quieter about the subject, hiding it from my mother who came from a long line of psychics and mediums. I didn't expect her to understand, despite her lineage and interest in the subject.

It wasn't until the birth of my sister when I was nearly 6 years old that I began to speak up about my experiences. My family murmured about my beautiful baby sister, murmured to each other that she obviously had ""the gift,"" despite the family belief that the ""gift"" skipped a generation, or that it appeared in a pattern of strength, weakness, strength, weakness...

I knew then that what she had was impermanent, and it made me jealous that they believed they saw in her what I knew was in myself.

I remember one day in particular that my mother put my sister in her crib for a nap, and returned several minutes later to the sounds of the baby crying. When she and I came upon the nursery, we discovered that the firmly closed door was ajar, and that my sister was yet again snoring softly. What my mother did not know about the experience was that I saw a middle-aged woman sitting in the chair next to the crib.

When we moved into the house we had built further along the lane of the same property, it was apparent that the ghosts had a connection to the land, not just the previous house. I would see them more and more frequently; I even began hearing them by the time I was about 12.

When I was 13, I entered a phase of fascination with the American Civil war. I had antiques of the period lying about my bedroom, and I believe my avid interest may also have stirred long forgotten figures of the past. I began seeing soldiers, not only in my house, but outside the house. These events sparked memories of my experience of Gettysburg, a schooltrip taken when I was 10.

During that trip, we visited a battlefield, and the sounds of gunfire and yelling reverberating in my ears were too much for me to handle, and, with hands over my ears, begged my teacher to let me return to the school bus. Of course, this is another story to be explained at another time.

So when I began to see the apparitions around my own home, you can only imagine how frightening it was to me. One in particular appeared to me every night without fail, at the end of the hallway outside of my bedroom. It was a Northern soldier with a scraggly beard and hollowed (but not missing) eyes. Each night, he advanced closer, frightening me to the point where I was afraid to leave my room, night or day. It was in mid-afternoon one summer day that I opened my door, and there was the angry soldier, staring directly at me from less that a foot away. I ran screaming onto the porch, where I fainted at my father's feet. It was then that my mother knew I indeed had the gift.

Over the years in that house, members of my family and myself frequently saw a black cat darting up and down the stairs, a farm doctor we lovingly named Doc who would turn the television off when he felt the program was inappropriate, his wife who often comforted me during my times of distress, and many more, all stories for another day.

We are now living in a different house, full of paranormal activity that I shall write about in another post.

Antique Store,"Illinois, United States",Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: Antique Store

I have always been skeptical. I am someone who believes that YOU believe what happened to you but I need to experience things myself to truly be convinced.

Growing up in an old farmhouse (it is one of the oldest in my town) there were always the usual creaking sounds of the floors and stairs, doors closing on their own, lights flickering... These were always dismissed as the house just settling.

Now fast forward 10 years. I meet my now husband and he shares with me all of the strange, ghostly experiences he has had throughout his life. I always believed him but never fully without having my own experience. Sometimes his stories seemed so far-fetched that the only thing that made me believe was his belief.

About 2 months after we are married, we are living with his parents and I get a job working at an antique store in our town that is in a house that is at least 120 years old. It is a big, beautiful and grand house where I always imagined someone of importance or money lived there. It is the typical big house with a foyer, parlor, dining room, and kitchen downstairs and 5 huge bedrooms and one bath upstairs. There was a grand staircase in the foyer directly across from the front door (that had bells to notify of anyone entering or leaving the shop). Once upstairs, there was a small banister along the hallway which ran straight down the middle of the house with the narrow, back stairway leading down to the kitchen.

The back door to this house was not used as a customer entrance, only by me when coming and leaving work, therefore the door was always dead bolted. I worked by myself all day long, never seeing the owner as she had another small shop across town. Days were always long and I caught up on a lot of reading and quite a few naps to be awakened by the bells when a customer came in.

On this particular day it is around 2 or 3:00 and only a few people had come in. At one point there were about 4 people in all at once (a rush, so to speak). I helped them find their purchases and such and they left. So knowing that my chances of anyone else to talk to was slim to none, I called my husband at home since he didn't work that day. Just as we started to talk I heard the hall floor upstairs creaking and then I heard very clearly two women talking about the victrola that was along the small banister at the top of the stairs.

I told my husband I would have to call him back as I somehow missed some customers. I always liked to be in eyeshot of people as many liked to pock small items. I went up the front staircase to find nobody there. I looked in the 2 front bedrooms at the front of the house and they were empty. I continued down the hallway to the back of the house, looking in every room and each closet, calling out ""Hello?!""

Okay, they must be downstairs already via the back stairwell so I start down it to the kitchen and about 3 stairs down, I feel a cool breeze. It was gentle but enough to give me goose bumps on my arm. I dismiss it as a draft even though where the air conditioners were positioned upstairs it couldn't have been from them.

I make the circle back to the parlor room off the side of the foyer where my desk was, checking along the way and there was nobody in the house. They couldn't have gone out the front door as I mentioned before, the bells would ring. I am scared out of my mind now, the hair on my neck standing up. I don't know if it was from fear or something paranormal but I ran to the telephone to call my husband.

I quickly told him my experience and told him to get up there and sit with me for the rest of the day ""RIGHT NOW!"" Luckily, he was only 6 blocks away and was there in no time. He snickered at me and told me ""I told you that spirits and ghosts are real"". I have been a believer ever since.

When I retold my story to my boss, the owner, she said that little things like that were always happening. She'd hear voices and have things moved. One time she said that the old fashioned cash register dinged open by itself. After the antique shop was closed, the house became a lawyer's office and it is now a residential home. I haven't spoken with anyone who has been in the house since but I often wonder if others have heard or experienced anything.

Since this experience, I have had a few more which I will share another time. I know this isn't probably a very exciting story but I feel it is my first TRUE paranormal experience and just wanted to share it. Thanks for reading!

The Theater Ghost,"Florida, United States",Apparitions / Voices / Touches,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Apparitions / Voices / Touches :: The Theater Ghost

I recently was employed by a local theater, The Players. I was the costume manager and worked there for three years. The theater is said to be haunted by the ghost of a forlorn actress who lost her life on the way to her show. There is also said to be the ghost of a man, who depressed took his life by hanging himself in the tree just outside the backstage entrance.

I worked all hours of the night many times finding myself alone in the darkened theater. The costume loft was on the second floor accessed by a staircase. I would often hear the sound of footfalls as I sat at my sewing machine, I would get up to make certain that no one had entered. I would always find not a living soul, and came to the understanding that there was something more of the supernatural going on. It did not seem as if it meant any harm and I kind of liked the feeling of someone looking over me as I worked. Most of the stitchers refused to work at night as they said that the place just gave them the creeps.

It was not until the third year, that I would meet our ghost. I had a new stitcher in the shop and it was near Halloween, the other girls were giving her a bit of a scare telling of the haunted theater. The lady ask me if I had ever seen the ghost, I told her that I had been there for three years and never had the pleasure of the ghost's acquaintance. We all had a laugh and resumed our work. My office was situated directly across from the costume shop so that we could keep an eye to anyone that might need us. I told the girls that I was going outside the backstage entrance to have a smoke if they needed me. As I left I turned right out of the shop and out of the corner of my eye noticed that a man was standing in my office, I had taken about three steps, then turned to go back to the office. No one was there! I had seen him clearly, he was looking out my window and he was wearing a colored shirt and a cap. Only when I stopped to think did I realize that I had only seen his image from about the waist up though he was standing to the nearside of my desk. I went back into my shop and told the girls what had happened.

Regrettably I lost a stitcher that day, but I had finally made the acquaintance of the theater ghost

Late Night Occurances,"Texas, United States",Apparitions / Voices / Touches,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Apparitions / Voices / Touches :: Late Night Occurances

W hen I lived with my brother in a small town called Lytton Springs, we were real big into 4 wheelers. I had a Yamaha Blaster and Greg (my sister in law's bro) had one of those Honda 4wd utility quads, it was really nice. Anyway we would go out every night after school and go riding down all the long empty roads that seemed to go nowhere, there wasn't much out there but land used for cattle and what not. Lytton Springs was a small community of houses, a church with a large graveyard adjacent to it, and a small locally owned old country store.

The place was called Les Spradling's General store, It was built entirely out of wood, had an old cast iron oven that they used to heat the place. A few years prior the founder and owner was shot dead behind the counter, being that it was a small town where everyone knew each other, this was a big deal. Les was a great guy, he used to give us free sodas for coming by to talk to him and helping him out around the store. Les had built the store himself from the ground up and was a great friend to the majority of the people in the area. The night he was murdered, a drunk had stumbled into the store and as he went to pay for his alcohol he pulled out a gun and ordered Les to empty the register. Les gave him the money and being a generous and friendly man had told him he could always come to him if he needed someone to lend him some money for whatever reason. The man pulled out a gun upon receiving the cash and shot Les in the chest and left him to bleed to death, all alone in the store he had built to support his family.

Since Les died, everyone assumed that the store would be closed down which meant all the ranchers and people in the area would have to make the long drive to the next town to get things they needed. This town pretty much depended on his store for gas, feed, food etc... Things just weren't the same after he'd been killed and some strange things started happening in the area. Greg and I would still ride our quads all over at night, riding with our lights off with nothing but the moon out to light the dark lonely roads. We came across a lot of strange things, some that are hard to explain.

Near our place we found 2 abandoned grave yards, one was a Mexican grave yard, it had small faded statues of the Virgin Mary and crumbling graves with strange engravings on them, they didn't seem to be in Spanish like one would assume. When we discovered this place we were excited, I mean its not everyday you just discover something like this especially when you know the area real well. It was tucked away on a small dirt path that lead off through some brush on the side of the road quite a ways down. There was an old rickety fence made out of mesquite and barbed wire, it had a strange smell to it I can't really describe, the air felt musty and cold, usually when its cold the air is crisp. We were walking through the graveyard looking around, trying to read the tombstone and looking at the dates all of which were dated from the late 1700s to mid 1800s. There was a total of about 20 tombstones.

One of which was separated from the rest with a three foot high stone barrier surrounding it, all the rocks had been stacked around it and there was a faded hue of black paint on the top section of the rocks. They appeared to be limestone chunks, probably gathered from the local area back then, completely natural, in no way were they cut or shaped. The tombstone inside of this barrier was an old Spanish cross, the startling part of all this was a snake twisting in and out of the gaps in the tombstone, I don't know what kind of snake it was, it didn't look indigenous to the area.

We mostly have rattlesnakes, copperheads, water moccasins and garter snakes. This one however  looked like any of those, it appeared to be 4 or 5 feet long about 5 inches in diameter but it was hard to tell with it twisting around the way it was. I have never seen a snake do anything like this before, it was like it was defending the tombstone and was completely oblivious to our presence there. The only thing I can think it might have been doing was trying to shed but its scales weren't flaky and showed no signs of molting. It was a glossy pitch black, had a vipers head with the big puffy cheeks (probably heat pits) and its belly was also the same glossy black as its scales. After watching it swirl around this tombstone for a few minutes we decided to see if we could scare it off, we grabbed a fallen branch and reached out to poke at it. It was completely unresponsive, no signs of aggression or even trying to avoid the branch, it just kept swirling around the tombstone like that was its sole purpose in life. We gave up messing with the snake and decided to get going, that was all that happened that day.

On another night when the moon wasn't out and it was almost pitch black outside, we were out having fun following cars with our lights off then getting up real close and turning them on suddenly to mess with people. It was fun in a bored redneck sort of way, we had a few people try and chase us after doing this which made it even more fun! After about 12:00 am, you have maybe a 5% chance of seeing a car go by, so we rode into Lytton Springs to see if we could find any other people driving around. We were riding around Les Spradling's store and around the church and graveyard just looking around, it was the first time we had actually taken the time to look around the small town. There was a water tower and a ton of enormous oak trees that had to have been hundreds of years old. There was also this giant gazebo looking thing in this clearing of land. It was made entirely of wood, had dirt floors, a small stage, some stalls, chairs and things. The people in the area called it the tabernacle, it was were my brother got married.

We started circling the graveyard admiring how large some of the tombstones were and even though we felt a strange feeling of guilt we decided to see how exciting it would be to creep through the gate and walk around the graveyard at night. The place was huge but nothing strange happened until we left, we were going down the road behind the church, we could see the back door to the church, and the small volleyball court behind it. We slowed down to look back at the graveyard, when I noticed the back door to the church starting to open. A woman in a sickly white dress peered through the darkness at us, she just stood there. We were pretty sure we weren't just seeing things, they lock that place up every night and I doubt anyone would sleep over.

We started to talk about who it might be and when we looked back to get a better look she was gone but the door was still open. This kind of creeped us out so we started to drive off to go back home. When we got to the 4 way crossing there she was again, standing in the middle of the road arms dangling at her side, she seemed to glow just a little bit and was very sickly looking with an expression of devastation. She scared the crap out of us so we went full throttle and sped right past her. I didn't notice any change in temperature or smell but then again I was going 60mph and had the wind blowing against me. We trucked it about 5miles back to the house and never saw her again. But it makes for a good story.

A lot of other stuff happened out there, like the ghost dog that would always come flying out of the bushes barking chasing us off yet we NEVER saw it, every night this thing would come out of the ditch on the side of the road next to where this Muslim cemetery is but only if we actually stopped there, we tested this theory many times to try and see if it was just a local stray but would never get a glimpse of the thing, on one occasion I actually got off the quad to look, as soon as I heard the bushes rattle and the barking I'd jump back on and take off, while Greg would be parked a few yards ahead watching to see if he could see it. NOTHING! My older brother grew up in the area and when we told him about this dog he said ,that when he was a kid him and his friends had this dog that got attacked by another dog that was notorious for being vicious and apparently unkillable. His friend Joe shot the murderous dog 4 times and it didn't die, it walked off like nothing had happened it at all. Maybe the thing in the bushes was the same dog but only a faded spirit? He recounted many of his memories of how him and his friends were out to kill this dog for killing their pet but every attempt to injure it or capture it were fruitless. So who knows?

I have more stories to tell of Lytton Springs but I'll save those for another post Enjoy

Thank You Grandma,"Michigan, United States",Family / Friends Visits,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Family / Friends Visits :: Thank You Grandma

I never met my dad's mom, because she died before I was born. She had cancer, and while she had her treatment done my mom would go and visit her. My mom said that my grandma got so worked up to see me and she was so excited to see her son's baby. But one fateful night she died. She may never have seen me during life but she did promise herself that she would see me.

When my parents were together about thirteen years ago they wanted to buy a house. Being new parents themselves they wanted a cheap but decent house. But they didn't know they would be getting a haunted house. Every person who lived there saw dead relatives and friends. Well, one evening my dad thought it was hot so he went into the closet and tried to open the window. It didn't budge. He gave up.

So, during one night my mom was sleeping and woke to her name being called. Sure enough it was my grandma. But she spoke fast but spoke with wisdom.

The next week she made another appearance. This time she said ""Hurry your curling-iron is on"". My mom hurried into the bathroom. But the electronic device was slipping, almost into the toilet. My mom grabbed it just in time.

My mom was scared of the house so they moved out. Right when my mom left, the closet she heard a creaky noise. She turned around and the window that could never be opened, opened. My mom flew out of that house and is still scared of it until this very day.

A Dog And A Grandfather,Canada,Apparitions / Voices / Touches,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Apparitions / Voices / Touches :: A Dog And A Grandfather

M y Story Begins in January 2005, with the death of my uncle Bob. I was about 15 at the time and his death upset me regardless of the fact I barely knew him. It was at the funeral I felt my first presence. A being was hovering above the casket, some one who was not my uncle, but some one I recognized. For the next few months as I was getting over my Uncles death the presence was in my house it felt like it was trying to comfort me.

Then on April 15th, 2005, the first disturbance happened. I was really down in the dumps when the radio which I never turned on and the volume was off, began playing the song ""Don't Worry Be Happy"". The radio played the song then, as suddenly as it started, it shut off.

All was quite a while after that until September 2007 when I was watching television at around 2:00am with the bright full moon and clear skies. At 2:00 exactly the television shut off (the remote on top of it).

I could smell a familiar musk, one I haven't been familiar with since 1995 and the smell of cigarettes (our house is a smoke- free house). The only person who smoked was my Grandfather who had been dead since 1995. I could tell he was telling me to go to bed so I said into the air ""I'll go after this show Opa"". After I said the smell cleared and the TV turned back on.

The next day I was vacuuming the upstairs landing when the smell returned. I looked out into the hall towards the picture of my Grandparents and I saw the outline of a man with a cigarette staring at the picture. I quickly shut the vacuum off and left him in his thoughts.

The next disturbance scared both me and my dog Senta. My dog and I were in the office on July 26th 2007. She was lying on the floor while I was on the computer. My family had gone for the day and the cats had been locked up as usual when my parents went out.

At around 12pm, the computer and TV suddenly shut off simultaneously. Senta sits up, ears in attack mode, starts growling at then I looked at the thermometer and it had dropped before my eyes 6 degrees lower than normal. I then heard work boots up in my parents' bedroom. Since no one was home and the dog was acting odd I grabbed a baseball bat and made my way to the stairs where the sound had made its way to. I got to the stairway and no one was there so I then turned around and left. The sound of footsteps moved up back into my parents' room, and disappeared. The temperature rose again, the TV and computer turned back on.

In November we had to put Senta down. When I came home from school that day my parents had taken her to the vet, so I went for a walk. I walked by my house at 4:30pm (the moment she died) and I looked in our bay window and saw her there a full body apparition looking at me.  I looked at her, she barked and vanished.

Over the next few months (November  -  present time) I have felt and seen her in her usual spots in the office, upper landing, door way, and the hallway. Once I even heard her bark from the basement living room. I have grown used to her now. I believe she protects the house.

On another note, in the same time period (November - Present) I have seen a man walking up my side steps out of the corner of my eye, so has my friend Drew and my Mother. My father has seen Senta around as well.

"Awake, But Cannot Move","Colorado, United States",Old Hags / Night Attacks / Sleep Paralysis,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Old Hags / Night Attacks / Sleep Paralysis :: Awake, But Cannot Move

This is my story, and I'm sticking to it! No one I tell, believes me, so let me share.

About 3 months ago, I moved into a new house. It was built in 1979, so it's not actually THAT old. Since I have been in this new house, I hear noises of all kinds throughout the night. I try to put an object to the sound. ""Oh that's the boiler, or Oh, that's the house settling, or the coffee pot, or the stove, or the dishwasher"". I'm still quite unsure of the sounds, but it helps me to sleep better, kind of...

Well, like I said, I have been here for only 3 months. In this time, I have woken up at night to about 3 instances that I can remember. I'm absolutely terrified! I can't move, I can't open my eyes, I can't do anything. I know I'm awake, because I am thinking to myself while this is happening to me: ""Oh god, here we go""...""Open your eyes""...""Sit up in bed"".

I feel as if something is almost like hovering over me. I mean, I can sense ""something"". I'm not sure what it is. My body shakes uncontrollably during this process, well, let me re-phrase. It's more like the feeling of shivering in the bitter cold, but I'm not cold. It's a ""massive"" shivering. Not just a chill. I don't feel anything heavy on my chest, like other stories, I don't hear any breathing, I don't see, or hear anything. I can just ""sense"" something over me. Almost like this entity, or whatever it is, is instilling this fear into me. Like I said, I can absolutely do nothing when this happens. I am at a total loss for what I can do. I'm not very superstitious, so I'm wary of water under the bed, etc.

Its funny no one believes me, not even my g/f. She claims she can sense the deceased. For instance, we were in our kitchen in our previous house, and she got really quiet. I asked her what the matter was, and she said nothing. I repeatedly asked her if something was wrong. She randomly blurted out, ""Think of me more often"". ""Huh, I said!"" She kind of snapped out of whatever she was in, and said, ""This message was meant for you"". ""Uh, ok, I said"". What's going on? She tells me, someone told her to tell me to think of him more often. She then goes into explaining to me how this person was sitting. I freaked out, because it was the way my friend used to sit in my Volkswagen beetle. She didn't know him, as he was a friend from before I even met her. He was my best man in my wedding 8 years earlier, and he died in a car accident.

So, my point is, SHE doesn't even believe me that this is happening to me. I would expect her of all people, who claims she has this small gift, to at least be sympathetic to what I tell her, and I get no rise out of her. Almost like she thinks I'm kidding.

SO is this a spirit? Is this some sort of sleep paralysis? I'm completely open for any suggestions on this. I don't like to sleep in my bedroom anymore since this happened to me. I find myself almost opening my eyes at random times, expecting something to be visible. If there's anyone out there, that has had this happen to them, and knows how to stop it, please respond. Anything, please! =)

My Uncle's Story,"Ohio, United States",Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: My Uncle's Story

H ere's a story that happened in my uncle's house. They lived in the house for a long time, and the little boy has been there longer. There's a little boy that died in that house a couple years ago. So my cousin, Chase and his older brother, Andy, had to sleep in the room that the little boy had.

One night, Chase couldn't sleep so he heard the little boy say, ""Chase, come play with me..."" He was so scared that he actually had to wake up his brother and tell him what happened. Then my uncle told me and my parents the story on a Halloween. He said that they call the little boy Tony since they don't really know who he is or how he died. So when he was telling us, you could hear a door open and close, when everyone was downstairs. They just said that it was Tony. I was so scared that I went on the ground with their dog Kelly. She actually got closer to me since she knew I was scared.

Then Matt, my uncle, told us that when he and Shelly, his wife and my aunt, were downstairs and Chase and Andy were sleeping, they heard the little boy say that he wanted to go to bed too. So then they understood that the little boy was still looking for his parents that must have died when he was home. So the next morning, they told Chase and Andy to go into another room and to NEVER go in that room unless they know about it.

We went over there on Christmas and Andy said that Chase and he were going to talk to the little boy. I told my parents and they thought that I was just kidding around. But then they actually went, ""Rachel, BE CAREFUL!""

So when we went up there, Kelly went up there too. I went on the top bunk, Chase went on the bottom, and Andy lied down on Kelly. So the first thing that happened was that Kelly started to bark at the toy box next to the closet. The lid actually opened up and was set on the ground. It ACTUALLY happened. Then ""Tony"" said that he wanted us to play, even though there was no one else in the room. Chase and Andy wanted to get out of the room, but I said that they're chickens, so they just stayed in the room.

So then we asked where he was, but he just said he wanted to go downstairs. I'm starting to think that since my parents and I went over to their house so much, the little boy actually started coming to the condo. Sometimes he's not here, sometimes he comes and visits. And I think that I was 5 or 6. I think I should have put that first. So, that's pretty much what I found out about the little boy in both houses. If I knew anymore about the little boy, I would have added it, sorry.

A Ghostly Encounter,"California, United States",Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: A Ghostly Encounter

O ne day in late October, I invited my friends to come to a haunted house that we knew of across the street. So we had my mom drive us there.She wanted to stay in the car because she was too afraid. So we walked in with flashlights and looked over everything. We saw torn furniture, broken windows, and a black cat that we constantly heard meowing.

We were all gathered in one circle standing up in the living room, at least we thought that it was the living room.I was the first one to say something.I said, ""If there is any ghost, or a person who used to live here, please give us a sign of your presence."" Within one minute, we heard a ball start bouncing. We all screamed and ran to the door.

Unfortunately, this house was a huge house and we traveled far to get to where we started talking to the ""ghost"". We were all running around the house not knowing where we were going. I finally told all of then to stop and figure it out. We were all silent until we heard the ball bounce again. Luckily, we found the door to the right of us and we ran out screaming like crazy lunatics and that scared my mom.

Once we were in the car, we looked back at the house and vowed never to go there again.

"Dad, What Are You Doing In My Room?","New York, United States",Apparitions / Voices / Touches,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Apparitions / Voices / Touches :: Dad, What Are You Doing In My Room?

S ome strange things have been going on in my house. It all started one day, about a year ago. This was back when both me and my sister were still in high school.

My mom usually gets home from work at about eight thirty in the morning. On this particular day she was late, so my sister and I were already at school. As she was walking into the house, through the garage, she heard the dial-up sound from our computer. For my internet, you have to click on light link on the desktop and then click on the dial button. So, my mother figured that one of us had stayed home. When she looked all around the house, no one was there and the computer was on the internet. This has happened about five times since then, and one of the times I was sitting right across the room.

Yeah, now that was strange but this is even weirder. One day, about a month ago, I was sitting at the computer. My whole family was home, my dad, my mom, and my sister. When I looked down to the end of the hallway, near my parents' room, I saw my dad standing there. After standing there for about a minute, he turned and walked into my room, which is diagonal from theirs.

Being a teenage girl, I got up and ran to my room, getting ready to yell at my dad for being in there. When I got to my room and looked around no one was in there.

Immediately, I went into my sister's room, which is across from mine, and looked for him in there. Nope, nowhere to be found. So, trying to figure everything out, I went into my parents' room. My mom was lying in bed and I asked her where dad was. She said that he had been in the shower for about ten minutes. As I walked further into their room, I heard the water running down.

Good Dog,Canada,Pets / Animals,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Pets / Animals :: Good Dog

M y last story was the kind of thing that by the standards of this site could be considered a little bland, no apparitions, no noises, merely a presence felt. Well this one has a little more substance to it. A couple years ago I was living with my friend whom I will call -B-, in his townhouse condo. Also living there was -M- who was -B-'s girlfriend and our other friend -D-.

We were sitting around one night chatting in the living room and it started to get darker but we didn't bother to turn on any lights as it got darker. Many hours later it was completely black in the house, we could no longer see each other, we could still sort of make out the outline of the furniture.

I don't remember who mentioned it first but sitting right beside the chair -B- was sitting in there was a shape, sort of indistinct in the poor lighting but visible, which was strange given that I couldn't make out the other 3 people in the room. We all agreed we could see it and then it sort of moved across the room and down the stairs toward the basement.

The shape was about the size of a medium dog, like a German Shepherd or Labrador, and while -B- did own a dog it was a mixed Pomeranian-Chihuahua breed which was little bigger than a football.

After that I had one other experience with our spirit, -B-, -M-, and -D- were all visiting -D-'s family in our sister city 3 hours away, and I had to work so I had the house to myself. I was taking some garbage to the dumpster and had just come in the back door to hear my cell phone ringing. I pushed the door shut as I ran to get my phone and then wandered up to my room while talking to whoever it was that phoned, I don't remember if it was my parents or our friend -L-.

When I woke up the next morning I realized I had been so caught up in my phone I had left the back door unlocked as it has no hand lock, only the deadbolt. I went to the back door to find the deadbolt was now locked. No-one else arrived home until that evening at which time we found that the light bulb outside the back door was missing. Light bulbs are frequently used as a surface to heat methamphetamines on for smoking. I think the spirit locked the door to keep a meth head out who might have robbed or damaged the house.

Also -B- says he actually saw it once. He was alone in the basement, where all 4 of our computers were set up for socializing while we were on our computers. He caught movement out of the corner of his eye and turned his head toward the stairs. There was the head of a golden retriever poking around the edge of the stairs. As he got up it pulled its head back out of site, he checked over the whole house without any sign of it.

Bear - 1991 To 2008,"California, United States",Pets / Animals,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Pets / Animals :: Bear - 1991 To 2008

My mother has a dear friend whose daughter got married. The daughter's name was Marie. Marie got married to an FBI agent and part of his job entailed for them to move a lot and live in corporate housing. Basically this meant NO PETS. So my mom kind of inherited Marie's two cats...

The two cats a Siamese, Katie, and Russian Blue, Bear, instant became members of our family and integrated into our existing pets' lives very well.

Over the years, Bear was starting to lose his eyesight, but his ears were so keen you would never know it.

On Sunday, my mother was washing her face and when she came out she was going to let the other pets outside. However, she noticed Bear perched under the grand piano as he normally presides and she called him to come to her so she could let Bear and the other pets outside. The other cat kept meowing and acting as if she wanted to go outside.

When my mom opened the front double doors of the house she found Bear's lifeless body laying down near the door on the OUTSIDE of the house. He had died recently since he was still warm, but no heartbeat. It was strange that he had died outside of the house even though she had seen him inside clear as day under the piano stool moments earlier. It was almost as if he was saying goodbye to her via his spirit even after his death on the outside of the front door.

This past Sunday, June 22, 2008 Bear passed away. He was 17 years old and lived a very long and pampered life. He brought nothing but happiness, joy, and love to our family and we will miss him tremendously.

I am thankful and grateful that Bear died on my mom's property and not anywhere else where we would have been left wondering if he was hit by a car or not knowing why he went missing. Even in death he came back to us to say his final goodbye.

My Spirit Grandfather,"Kansas, United States",Family / Friends Visits,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Family / Friends Visits :: My Spirit Grandfather

M y story occurred over the length of my childhood, beginning when I was 4 years old. I awoke one night and went to the bathroom. I returned to my room and got back in bed when I became aware of a presence in the hallway just outside my door. As I was only 4, and scared to death, I pulled the covers up over my head, and told the presence to go away. I cannot recall if I actually heard a disembodied voice, or if I was only able to sense it, but the being said that it would go but that it would return.

Four years went by, and no other activity was noted, until the night when the experience repeated itself, with an identical response from both me and the ghost. Again I had gotten up before the occurrence and I am positive that I was awake when it occurred.

Fast forward again, to my early teen years. I had become involved with a group called the Inner Peace Movement, which on the local level in my town was a group of folks who met every Friday night in a private residence, to hold spiritual development sessions. There was a youth group (mostly the children of the adult couples that met upstairs) that held meetings in the basement.

The basic tenets of the group were that we all have the ability to get in touch with our extra-sensory gifts, and that one could practice developing them with exercises and by paying attention to one's relationship with the spiritual realm beyond our normal range of sensation.

The woman Helen M. who ran the local group and who hosted the meeting was a sensitive who would give readings. She sat me down in a comfortable chair and provided me with some tract literature to read, while she sat across from me. She achieved a trace state and after about twenty minutes, she awoke and we recapped her assessment. All of this was written out on an assessment form that was pre-printed and had spaces for individual comments.

I still have this to this day. One piece of paper had an explanation of the various types of perception: Prophetic, Feeling, Intuitive and Visionary as well as the order that I relied on these skills in my daily life. On another paper was a diagram showing the number of guardian angels a person had (these were folks who had evolved enough through reincarnation to avoid rebirth. They then elected to function in the spiritual realm as individual guardian angels for those who were living).

I had five, whose last incarnations were: A Roman charioteer, a Roman Senator, a ""Forest Woman"" who lived amongst the animals and had herbalist skills, a Privateer (Pirate) and a British Mathematician.

Then she dropped the bomb. She said, ""You have another spirit attached to you that is between realms. Do you have a male relative that died in a fire or an explosion?

My Grand Daddy Clyde Redenbaugh had died years before my birth during an explosion at the Kansas Power and Light plant in Topeka. He had gotten out safely during an evacuation of the plant but had gone back in to rescue someone left behind when the plant was ripped apart by a gas explosion. I had never met him, and had no living Grandfathers. He had been married to my favorite grandmother, and I had always been curious about him

Helen explained that folks who have died in a violent or sudden way may have not been aware that they had indeed passed on, and that they could become entangled in the environment in which their deaths had occurred, or caught up in the emotional needs of their survivors. We planned a very simple ceremony to contact Clyde's spirit, to thank him for his concern and to give him permission to cross over to the light. I have never felt or heard from him again. But it has provided me with personal proof of the afterlife. I hope when it's my time to cross over he will be amongst those who welcome me in the light.

A Night Visitor,Greece,Apparitions / Voices / Touches,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Apparitions / Voices / Touches :: A Night Visitor

F or those who've read my stories concerning Anima, I'd like to say that I have decided not to continue with an update of the recent events simply because it involves people other than me and a long history that is best to be forgotten.

With that being said, I'd like to share two recent events that seem to have affected me considerably.

Sometime last week after midnight, I decided it was high time I went to bed so, following the usual routine, I took my three female dogs with me into the bedroom and closed the door behind me.

My husband was in the computer room next door in the company of our fourth male puppy.

It didn't take long for me to fall asleep but at around 2.30am, I woke up feeling very hot as if the room was on fire. I still recall the discomfort I felt while I was trying the get the bed covers off of me when suddenly I felt some kind of resistance. It was as if somebody was pushing against the bed covers. It wasn't a violent resistance- it was more as if somebody was just physically standing between me and the covers and I caught them off guard.

I remember the feeling of overwhelming terror as I pushed back while trying to literally force myself to sit up in bed and then, I got the glimpse of what looked like a misty outline of a person, possibly female bending over me. Its head was an inch away from my face but I could see no features other than a ""delicate"" outline of a body which was what led me to believe it was possibly a woman. She seemed to be observing me and as I poked my head forward to see more clearly, she moved backwards and then vanished into thin air.

I screamed as loud as I could and my terrified husband came rushing into the room.

I recall the dogs running around the room, my one female scratching the closet on my left, my husband mattering phrases.

I was in complete terror but tried to regain control of myself while observing my one dog who continued to scratch the closet.

After an hour or so, a couple of litters of water and a few smokes, I decided that it was just a very vivid nightmare-nothing to worry about and made it back to bed, reluctantly.

Later that day, my level-headed, never-believing-in-anything-that-science-cannot-explain husband brought it up again and, to my surprise, I found myself being the center of his thorough investigation about last night's events.

I found it extraordinarily strange that he would persist on such a simple case of a bad dream but when I told him exactly what I thought I saw, pointing out that it must have been the product of a sleepy mind, I was shocked to hear ""...I think I saw something bending over you but... I don't know what I was seeing...""

He later concluded that it must have been the shadow of an object in the room that was somehow reflected on the wall above me and that the night-light in the room distorted its image.

I let it go not wishing to elaborate on it any further but one thing was really off regarding my husband's explanation of the event and that is, that shadows are dark not whitish. Moreover, never did he mention the dog's strange reaction and pretended to ignore her scratches on the closet. But then again, so did I.

Last night, while we were watching TV, the dogs (all 4 of them) began barking out of nowhere and running around the house.

Again the logical assumption was ""they must have smelled a cat or someone passing from our alley"".

We tried to get them to stop by attempting to draw their attention, ordering them to sit and stay but to no avail. Finally, after a few rounds around the houses, sniffing, growling, and barking to invisible intruders, they settled down. Fatima, my most protective female, was agitated jumping to every sound coming from outside or from the TV.

Around 3am, I went off to bed taking her with me while my husband decided to stay up a little longer. He kept all the other dogs with him.

I was now literally forcing myself to sleep but, finally giving up the effort I sat up in bed, lit a cigarette and stood there silent. I could hear the other dogs sniffing the lower part of my door and for a moment I thought of letting them in but soon discarded the idea since I needed my privacy.

Then, there was a slight sound from behind me as if something was moving against the wall, almost like the sound of something solid rolling downwards. What followed was complete chaos! I remember turning my head behind, Fatima jumping on the bed attacking the wall, the dogs barking and scratching my door, the sound of my husband running to my rescue!

I saw nothing. I heard something! Fatima and the other dogs did too and I say this because they weren't alarmed because of her reaction. They had been outside my door sniffing something before I heard any sound and before Fatima charged against the wall.

I don't know what this is but I know there is something in my house-something curious enough to stand an inch from my face and observe me while sleeping. Was it sliding down the wall behind me last night? I don't know. What I know is that I wasn't sleeping- I wasn't dreaming, either.

Lots Of Happenings In My Life,Brunei Darussalam,Apparitions / Voices / Touches,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Apparitions / Voices / Touches :: Lots Of Happenings In My Life

I t all started when I was 5 years old. I was a little bit into the Supernatural, but I kind of messed with lots of spiritual objects in my lifetime.

I also begin to hear my name being called in my house, at school and at my friend's house. All my friends' houses. They would not believe me in what I am saying.

Then I can sense some beings that watches me and walking around my house. Whenever I'm alone, I would always feel a presence walking or staring at me. When my uncle died in 2006, I begin to feel a new presence in the house. I personally think he is the one calling me all my life or it could be my great-grand parent's spirits telling me something.

My interest in the Supernatural gave me an ability to see the future in my dreams. I had this at the age of 7.When I had one of these 'future sights', I would forget it, but when it happens, I would remember what the dream is and I will hit myself, and typically, my friends don't believe me.

I never had a serious accident in my life. It is as if like, an invincible guardian is protecting me. Like this once I nearly fell downstairs (which would be painful), then I got my footing and I do remember me trying to get my firm grip on the stair's steps.

My supernatural interest grew and my friends are losing their trust in me. I don't really need their help in the supernatural. But this is the last thing which is the weirdest in my life. The accidents that were about to happen to me are always serious, but I always see my friends suffer from normal injuries. (Like sprains)

Hope you all give me some comments about my personal story. May the Gods of Muslim, Buddhism and Christianity protect us all from harm.

Commenting Spirit In A Cemetery,"Ohio, United States",Ghost Hunting,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Ghost Hunting :: Commenting Spirit In A Cemetery

I would like to state that this is a GREAT site! Kudos to the folks that work on this site. Also, the posters here are great as well! I hope that I am not boring everyone with my EVP's. I have literally hundreds of these. I would like to share the better quality ones on this site. You guys seem to understand better than most people.

The reason that we do EVP work is curiosity about life after death. I have some theories that I have developed over time, derived from my EVP evidence. I won't bore you with that. I just want you to listen to this next EVP. This is VERY good proof that we go on, after we have passed away.

In this EVP you will hear a little boy comment to my daughter after she say ""just talk in here and we can hear you"". (Sorry I think she was eating the microphone when she says that...) This little boy spirit then says to her ""really, that makes us so loud?"" If you listen close to the word ""Loud"", you will hear a Canadian type accent. I live in North West Ohio and NOBODY talks like. However, this was recorded in a small cemetery, maybe 50 to 70 graves- from 1840 to 1940. It is abandoned, but it is kept mowed. There is not even a place to park. The significance that I attach to this is:

2) A direct response to my 10 year old daughter's request. This in itself means that they can hear and probably see us.

This EVP was captured on 11-23-2007 at approximately 8:30 PM. Let me know your thoughts on this one if you would. I fell this one is excellent proof of after-life intelligence.

On a side note. I have had people tell me that recording EVPs is too scary for them. I want to state that out of the hundreds of captures that we have, I have never felt spooked. No hairs on the back of my neck, feeling of being watched...etc. I have had an uneasy feeling once or twice but never caught an EVP at the same time. I have been cussed-out by a spirit on several occasions but never felt a thing!

One more thing for clarification. We use 4 different types of digital recording devices and we have had EVP on all of them. Sometimes when we are close during an ""Investigation"" we will catch the same EVP on 2 recorders. If you guys want more of my EVP work posted, let me know. I have all kinds of them. I even have some ""Scary / Creepy"" ones...

Cemetery Conversation Between Spirits,"Ohio, United States",Photographs / Videos / EVP,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Photographs / Videos / EVP :: Cemetery Conversation Between Spirits

H ello. As you may know from all of my previous stories, my family and I like to do EVP research. Here is just a little one that I thought was kind of funny. On 11-20-07 around 5:00 PM I stopped in this little Cemetery on my way home from work. I did the normal questioning, asking for message...etc. What I got instead was two ""spirits"" talking to one another. The male spirit says ""Got your blanket?"" The Female(?) Spirit says, ""I'm Leaving"" The male replies, ""What?"" The significance to me is:

Another note, if this was a radio wave...etc, why does she sound so much different than the male? I hope that I am not boring everyone with these EVPs. I just like to get the evidence out there and let you decide. As for me, I know... Thanks for your time and enjoy...

Ps. If anyone has evidence that they would like for me to review (no jokes please), shoot me an email. I would be happy to let you know what I hear!

The Roaming Condo Imp,"South Carolina, United States",Apparitions / Voices / Touches,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Apparitions / Voices / Touches :: The Roaming Condo Imp

N ow, I just want to say that I'm not very new to the 'super natural.' I've been having the paranormal happen to me my whole life.

When I was little, I used to have a companion that I referred to as ""The Old Man."" It scared my mom badly when I would begin just to talk to him because she couldn't see him. From what I remember, he was a grandfather that had died, but that isn't the story I'm telling today.

My mom divorced my dad when I was about ten or eleven and we all just left our rental property. My mom and I moved into a condo near my school and we got a dog. That was the agreement I gave her, if we moved, I had to have a dog. So we got a beagle-mix, and named her Holly (no it wasn't Christmas time either, it just seemed like a good name). We took her home and everything was fine, for awhile at least.

We'd been living in the condo for about two weeks before we got the dog and my mom had let me do most of the painting and stuff. So she was usually reading or something while I worked (I like doing the flooring and painting so it wasn't a big deal). But I started getting the feeling someone was watching me. I'd shut doors and cabinets just so I could work. I could hear scratching sounds behind me and only when my mom left for work did the things get weirder. Things would go missing and turn up in completely random places--like a paint roller ending up in the toilet bowl.

I would ignore these things because they weren't that bad. But then things got weird. My radio would turn off and I'd turn it back on, only to find as soon as I turned around it shut right back off. The painter's tape would disappear off the walls and be balled up in the corner of another room. I was creeped out, but I didn't tell my mom.

When we got the dog, I figured whatever was bugging me would just leave me alone. It did, but it turned abusive towards my dog. Holly would be sitting on the floor and suddenly yelp. She watched things that weren't there pace around the room. One time I touched her while she was watching something and she gave a sort of half growl, half whimper.

I remember that she'd suddenly have her collar (visibly) pulled, (she had a choke chain on for training) and she was dragged to her cage where she was locked in. I got fed up with this and told whatever it was to just leave the dog alone. It did.

I figured I was done with it. But after a few weeks, I started seeing shadowy figures walking around the place. I would hear tapping sounds from other rooms. Mind you, eventhough the walls between my neighbors and I is sound proof, I would hear voices whispering.

The constant feeling of being watched came back and stayed no matter how many times I would shut things. My hair would get pulled when I was watching TV, my cellphone would constantly end up in the refrigerator and my bedroom door got in the habit of locking itself.

Soon there would be scratches at my door and knocking sounds came from my closet. Snickering sounds came from the area around my nightstand. My homework would be thrown around the room when I woke up in the morning.

Then it just got scary. I would get the feeling of weight on my chest and my sheet would get pulled off the bed even if I held onto it. When I stayed up late on the computer, I'd catch a glimpse of only what I can describe as an impish figure bobbing around.

One night my door opened and shut and I looked out from under my sheet to see what was there. The imp-thing was staring at the bed from a distance of about three feet. I swear it had almost a reddish hue, but I can't quite be sure. I would guess it was about four feet tall standing up, but it looked hunched over by age, I suppose. It had a pointy hat on, as ridiculous as that may sound. It simply walked over to the foot of my bed and started pulling at my sheets. I held on but it was strong and started making hissing and spitting sounds. Then I felt the sensation of hitting on my legs. It was painful and when it stopped I basically curled up in a ball to sleep.

Now I could have simply played that night off as a bad dream... But I had bruises on my legs when I woke up. Furthermore, a chair by my desk was kicked over and my homework was scattered.

I still get the feeling I'm being watched sometimes, but ever since we got new neighbors the occurrences have subsided. I'm guessing whatever it is likes to haunt the newest residents, so I wasn't all that surprised when the people moved out, complaining of 'bad sound proofing' but the truth is, the sound proofing was brand new on their unit. When the next people moved in, I tried to give them a hint and they laughed it off. They moved out fast, too. In the end, the newest neighbors are hardly ever home. If you know what 'it' is please tell me. I'm curious as to why it doesn't just stay in one unit.

Behind The Old Grave Stone,"California, United States",Ghost Hunting,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Ghost Hunting :: Behind The Old Grave Stone

T here is this cemetary across the street where I live. It is said to have at least 150 grave stones. Sounds big? I know. So a few nights ago, I had just finished watching the movie ""Now and Then"" and I saw the part where the girls went to the graveyard and tried to speak with the dead. I thought that it might be fun to just take a walk through the graveyard and just look around. Boy was that a bad idea!

As my two friends and I entered the graveyard, the first thing we noticed was that the hairs on our arms were sticking straight up and that cold and chilly feeleing ran through our bodies. After looking at at least two gravestones together, we all thought that we heard a moan come from behind a BIG gravestone about 10 feet away from us.

We stopped and just looked at everything around us. We couldn't quite put our finger on what the noise exactly sounded like but we were sure that it sounded like a women moaning. My friend, Erin, was the first to speak up. She looked at me and said, ""Mickey, what is that sound?"" I responded, ""That sound is a women moaning, Erin."" We both laughed and then noticed something that almost paralyzed us. My friend Ricky was gone. Erin and I started freaking out and called his name about 10 times. We heard the moaning again behind the big gravestone and hoped that we would find him behind it.

We didn't find him. He was gone. We almost started crying when we heard this voice behind us say, ""Don't turn around! Don't turn aroound!"" Erin and I weren't that stupid. We turned around and slapped Ricky until he ""cried mercy."" This wasn't the time to be messing about. It started getting even more frightning because we heard the moan again, but louder. This was enough for us. We had to look behind every gravestone that was in front of us.

Ricky thought of something smart for once. Since it was pitch dark, he pulled out his camera and took photos of every gravestone so that he could see it with light. By this time, the moaning had stopped and we were calm. Erin and I locked arms and watched as Ricky took shots. After every gavestone near us had been photographed, we looked through them all. Nothing made us satisfied until we came to the last picture. What we saw frightened us a lot.

In the picture of the one of the gravestones we saw a ghastly figure. It didn't have an exact shape, but we saw the head and the chest. We knew that this was the ghost that we heard moaning behind one of the gravestones because this figure looked like it had hair. So it was in fact a women moaning.

That night as we walked home we were very surprised and impressed by what we found. We showed my mom the pictures and without a second thought, she knew that this was a ghost. So as I am writing this story now, I can't help but think of what we saw that night. And still to this day, I feel like the hairs on my arms are standing up.

The Ghost Of Ward Essex,Australia,Ghost Hunting,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Ghost Hunting :: The Ghost Of Ward Essex

T his story carries on from ' The Mist of Ward Essex '. As I explained in my last story, I heard earlier this year of the ghost of a woman who supposedly haunts the corner of Ward Street and Essex Road in Indooroopilly, Brisbane, Australia. Living in the area, I thought I would check it out and was lucky enough to actually capture something I could only describe as a fluorescent white mist with my camera (see my last story).

Since my first encounter with this ghost/spirit/whatever, I have been making regular trips (roughly weekly) back to the site with the hope of finding and capturing it again. Three months later, on the night of the 23rd of June, I succeeded.

During my 'ghost hunts' (for lack of a better word), I would generally observe the area for a couple of hours starting anywhere as early as 8pm or as late as 2am. I would also bring with me something to occupy myself, i.e. book, magazine, work etc. It does, after all, get pretty boring after awhile, as I'm sure you can imagine. Thankfully, winter isn't particularly cold in Brisbane (unless you're a Brisbanite). My procedure basically involved looking up from my occupation every now and then to see if anything out of the ordinary was going on.

On this particular night, I observed the area between the hours of 1am and 3am, roughly. It would have been around 3am when I decided to call it quits for the night. I was just packing up when, to my astonishment, I spotted the same fluorescent mist I had seen on my previous encounter across the street from me. I quickly (re) unpacked my camera and hurried closer for a better shot.

It was dancing around the street light post (see picture) when it suddenly stopped mid-flight and hovered some height above the ground. It now resembled a faintly glowing white ball. Underneath it appeared a sort of grey mass. I was lucky to shoot a single picture of it from a distance before it faded away.

Lucky though I consider myself to be to have witnessed such a manifestation, it is unfortunate that I was not as prepared as I could have been. Were I closer and my camera actually prepared, I would have gotten some far closer and more detailed shots. As it were, my single shot will have to do.

On closer inspection of my photo, I believe I have captured footage of a full-body apparition. The shape of the grey mass does appear (roughly) to be of both human size and shape with the white ball as a head.

I am now done with the site and its ghost as I have achieved what I set out to do.

Stage 28,"California, United States",Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: Stage 28

I was about 11 years old when my dad took me to his work to see what he does for a living. He works at Universal Studios which I always thought was a fun place to go.

As we were looking at all of the stages where movies, commercials, and shows were made, he asked me something that sort of made me a little uneasy. Remember that this was back when I was 11 and I did not really have interests in spirits. He asked me if I know what a ghost is. I said yes so he could show me whatever he was planning on showing me. He sprung up and said ""Great!""

As we were riding in his golf cart he took me to his building to get keys. He is a locksmith so it was fun to see his office where he had keys and locks everywhere! One of his partners in his office is named Jim. He was a very nice man and he really knew how to start up conversations. He asked me what I was going to do with my dad today. I told him that we were going to see stages. My dad popped his head out of his little room where he does research on the computer and said that we are going to stage 28. ""Stage 28?"" Jim said, ""Are you sure that you want to go there? I heard that it was a haunted stage. Well, if you don't know then I will tell you what it is. Stage 28 is where they filmed The Phantom of the Opera, the old movie. Now, I forgot who played the phantom but he died shortly after the movie was released and he comes to haunt that stage...""

Suddenly, my eyes were bugged out. I could say nothing more for my dad said that it was time to go. I sat back down into the golf cart staring at my dad still bug-eyed. ""Aww, come one! This will be fun,"" he said to me trying to comfort me. But nothing helped. I was truly scared out of my mind. And right when things got a little better, we arrived at stage 28.

It was locked so I figured that when we went to my dad's building we got the keys to unlock it. The door slid open and the first thing that I saw was the setting of where they shot ""masquerade"". It looked like it had not been touched in 20 years. We walked in and turned on all of the lights. To my surprise, it seemed kind of welcoming, in an odd way.

My dad and I stood in the middle of the set and looked around at everything. My dad opened his mouth to say something when we heard a speaker go off in the room. It sounded like someone mumbling. I got scared a lot. I yelled at my dad saying that he did this on purpose. That he hired Jim to say that stuff about this and he had a recording up in the booth up stairs and played it. He laughed and said that he promises he didn't. He offered to look up in the booth to see if anyone was there. To my very surprise no one was there and it was pitch black.

Suddenly I felt this pinch on my back and I yelped. This frightened my dad for he grabbed me and carried me down. I didn't get all of the drama of him carrying me down, but it felt good. As we entered the set floor again he suggested that we leave. I sure was on the same page as him because when we started walking out I quickly looked back and in one of the parts where people could sit down in the set, I saw a white mask floating in the blackness.

This was my first encounter with a ghost and now every once in a while I always drive back up to his work to take notes on what I see.

Our First Apartment Came With An Unexpected Roommate,Canada,Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: Our First Apartment Came With An Unexpected Roommate

A bout ten years ago, my now-husband and I moved to a new city and into our first apartment, on the second floor of a two-story house. To this day, he swears that he saw and felt nothing, but I am sure that we had a ghost. I always believed it to be the former home owner, who had passed away some time before. I'm told that she was a lovely person in life, and I never felt threatened by her presence - in fact it was odd that although some very eerie things happened there, I rarely felt afraid.

It started out with very small things - it took me a while to believe anything ""spooky"" was going on. I would occasionally go into a room to find a lamp on that I thought I'd turned off, that sort of thing. Then came an evening when I was home alone, and decided to take a shower. I should explain that the bathroom light was controlled by a dimmer switch, located in the hallway just outside the bathroom door. Well, as I showered I started to notice that the bathroom light was slowly growing dimmer, until finally I was standing there in the dark. I was surprised, but didn't think ""ghost"" right away - I figured there must be a problem with the bulb, or the switch. I stepped out of the shower and into the hall to fiddle with the switch, and was surprised to find that it was off - this was one of those twisty dimmer switches, and it had been turned all the way back and pushed in to shut it off. When I turned it back on, it worked just fine.

Shortly after that I arrived home from work and hour or so before my husband, and lay down on the sofa to take a nap before dinner. While asleep I had a dream - I guess it was a dream, anyway - that I was lying there on the sofa, and heard someone unlock the front door at street level. I listened as they came up the stairs, opened the door and enter the hallway. I woke up thinking my husband had arrived home and called out, but he wasn't there. I was so sure that I had heard someone come in that I searched the whole apartment, but of course I found no one.

A few days later I was getting ready to leave for work - my husband was still in bed asleep. As I reached for the upstairs door knob, I heard someone run up the stairs, loudly and at great speed, and stop, suddenly, right on the other side of the door. I froze, thinking it was an intruder, and then took a deep breath and threw the door open. There was no one there. I went downstairs to check the bottom door, but it was locked and dead-bolted. I went back upstairs and exclaimed to my husband about it, but he'd slept through the whole thing, and, skeptic that he is, just suggested that I lay off the morning coffee.

Anyway, other things happened in the apartment from time to time. The funniest was the time I was standing in a corner of the kitchen taking something out of the microwave, when I heard something fall to the floor a meter or two behind me. I turned around and found, right in the middle of the kitchen floor, my toothbrush. It seemed like it had been taken from the bathroom and thrown down the hall into the kitchen, just to get my attention!

However, one of the oddest things happened when I wasn't even at home. On this particular evening, my husband was working late and because I was pretty swamped I had decided to do the same. Everyone else had left for the day, and I was sitting along in my office when I heard a voice - a woman's voice, clear as a bell! - say, ""you need to go home..."" I didn't feel worried, but I found myself getting up, putting on my coat, and leaving the office - I walked straight home without another thought. I was in the apartment for a few minutes when I started to smell smoke. As I raced around trying to find the source, the smoke became thicker until I was coughing and my eyes were watering. I raced downstairs and pounded on the door of the first-floor apartment. No one was home except the cat, which mewed frantically at me through the kitchen window. I ran to my landlord's house two doors away, and he dashed over with a key. He entered the downstairs apartment and found that the tenants had left a pan of bacon grease on the stovetop. The knobs on the stove were quite loose, and the burner under the pan had somehow been turned on - we suspected the cat. The pan hadn't yet ignited, but was billowing black smoke when the landlord walked in. The people downstairs didn't come home until late that night, nor did my husband - if it hadn't been for that voice telling me to ""go home"" there probably would have been a fire.

Anyway, I think our ghost was upset when we were leaving, because that was the only time she was ever really destructive. One evening shortly before we left I was packing our things in the living room - from where I was sitting I could see clearly into the kitchen. As I sat there working I saw a whole stack of dishes levitate off the kitchen counter and smash to the floor. For some reason, I felt a bit ""freaked out"" for the first time ever - I think the ghost ""wanted"" to spook me a little bit. I actually waited outside on the step until my husband came home! As for the dishes, they were ugly ones that my husband had been carting around for years, and I never really liked them. He was really not impressed when I told him the ghost did it!

The Riverbed,"California, United States",Apparitions / Voices / Touches,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Apparitions / Voices / Touches :: The Riverbed

T his story happened in the town in which I still live. I was 9, so I just moved to the house and I wanted to explore a little. I became friends with these two kids, Bob and Billy (don't worry, these aren't their REAL names). I asked them if they wanted to show me the riverbed in the back of the houses and they said agreed. Now, it was the rainy season, so it was partially full of water, but we had no problem getting through.

We walked down to the riverbed in shorts and T-shirts, hoping to jump into the water. So, we walked through all the trees and the bushes carefully, being especially so since there are a lot of rattlesnakes down there. We walked down far into the riverbed so we wouldn't get caught when we go into the water (we weren't aloud to go into the river when it was full of water). We all quickly jumped into the riverbed laughing at the fact that we jumped in when not aloud to (yes, I know, poor reason to laugh, very childish).

Now, walking into the riverbed I got a eerie feeling. I felt like someone was watching us, walking behind us getting closer, the closer we all got to the river. I tried to dismiss that feeling, just ignoring it like I ignored other things relative to this. When I jumped into the river (I was the last to do so), I got this horrible feeling. Now, if you read any of my other stories like ""The Shotgun Guy,"" then you might think it's him. But no, it felt the complete oppisite of him--it felt evil.

I kept telling the guys that I wanted to leave and they kept asking why. I couldn't tell them that I felt an evil presence. No, I couldn't, they'd think I was weird. Since I couldn't convince them to leave and I didn't know the way back to my house, I was stuck there. So, once again, I tried to just ignore the feeling. I thought I could, until I saw THAT.

Bob and Billy were westling in the strong water, and I was just watching. I heard something from behind me, so I turned my head, but nothing, was there. So I just thought it might have been a rattlesnake and turned my head and watched the fight (I know, horrible way to react if there might be a rattlesnake that would most likely kill you right behind you). I heard it again, so I turned my head. This time I saw a black figure. It wasn't shadow-like, but solid and just covered completly in black from feet to head. I couldn't even see his face or anything.

I got extremly scared, I didn't know who (or what) it was. I screamed and jumped into the river. Why did I jump into the river? I do not know, reaction, I suppose. I was really short as a child (sadly, still am), so I kept going under the water. I was too freaked to swim. But the thing didn't go away. Even when I fell in, it was still there. The guys quickly came over to me (they could touch the bottom, of course). They kept me from drowning by holding me up. I could STILL see the thing. ""WHAT!?"" They kept asking. I pointed over to where the black thing was. They turned their heads and asked what. They couldn't see it. I fell into the water one last time and when I came back up the black figure was gone.

This black figure did nothing but stand there and stare at me. And I have no clue why I was the only one who could see it. But, yes, we quickly got out of the water and ran back up. When they asked me what happened, I just said I saw a couple rattlesnakes that were ready to bite. I didn't want them thinking I was a freak or anything. So they believed it and we never talked about it. Yes, I still go down to the riverbed. I'm no longer scared. The black figure may have seemed evil, but he/she (or it) did nothing. I still get that same feeling when I go down there, but I never seen the black figure down there ever again.

The Roof Top Voice,"South Carolina, United States",Apparitions / Voices / Touches,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Apparitions / Voices / Touches :: The Roof Top Voice

T his is an experience in Megget, South Carolina. I was at a friend's house and we were sitting on the roof. My friend, Victoria, and I were sitting on the roof of her home listening to the sounds of the Halloween festival about a five minute drive away. She was talking about how she'd been experiencing strange things at her house and I didn't believe her. I knew she liked her stories and her imagination. We were talking about how we were going to get down from the roof to go to the festival when she started complaining that she was cold.

Now this is a person that loves to complain, yes, she is one of those ""rich people."" I was kind of irritated that she was complaining about being cold and told her to hurry up and get a sweater, which she did and then asked to borrow my cell phone. I was completely baffled and handed it to her. She brought up the recorder on it and I was now on the verge of exasperation.

I believe in ghosts and spirits, I've been called a ""sensitive"" and stuff before. Now before I discredit her, I did get ""vibes"" from this place. I knew it had something in it, but again, Victoria was being obsessive over it.

Now back to her with my cell. She began recording and she started just asking random questions, I began getting bad vibes and told her to give me my phone back. After a good five-minute recording she did give it back and begged me to play it back.

I opened the file up and let her listen to it on speaker. At first, it was just her talking, then static started slipping in and whispering started coming in. By this time she was holding onto my arm panicking. A distinctive voice came after a while, ""Get off the damn roof before I get you off myself!"" Well, we kind of jumped into the window and slammed it shut. We decided against sneaking off that night and we laid out my sleeping bag and sat up and talked for awhile.

Victoria wanted to listen to the recording again and I reached for the place where my phone had been. I was shocked to find it was... gone? I had set it down right next to me, so I got up and shuffled through a few things. Victoria was muttering something about ""The ghost has it..."" I got the feeling she was right and pretty much cursed my luck.

We were giving one more attempt to look for the phone, checking the window sill and sticking our heads out of the window to check to see if maybe I'd dropped it outside. No luck. So we sat back down and my back was to the window.

Now I can only describe what I feel when the paranormal's around as ""vibes"" because its not really a solid feeling, mostly just a sensation. But I was getting bad vibes from the windows, so I shut all of the curtains except for the ones behind me. She sat down across from me and after about five minutes began staring at the window behind me. The vibes had been growing, so I was nervous to turn around. When I did there was a shadowy figure looking in at us, but it was silvery, not black, so it wasn't a burglar. She finally screamed and I shut the curtains and told her that we should go to bed since it was getting late.

When we woke up, we opened the curtains and I went to the bathroom to change and brush my teeth. When I came out, she went in. I asked her if she'd checked for my cell phone again, she nodded and said she'd pay for a new one. I was mad because I'd have to explain to my dad that I'd lost my birthday gift after a month.

I don't know why I checked the window sill again, but I did. My phone was sitting just on the outside of it with a dead battery. I'd charged it the day before and it usually could last a good four days on two bars of battery life. Needless to say, I was happy to have the phone back and left the house as soon as my mom came to pick me up.

Victoria's invited me over several more times... but I don't go there often.

The Entity,Canada,Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: The Entity

T his story is by far the most frightening experience I have ever witnessed. It did not happen at my house as usual. It did however happen at a house known to be haunted by me and my friend Chris.

The first occurrence that Chris and I witnessed was in October 2006. We were raking leaves for the owner of the house who had gone down to Mexico for the fall and asked us before she left to take care of the house.

At first nothing happened but as we continued Chris and I both felt like we were being watched. We went into the house to grab a bite to eat when in the doorway (it looked distorted in a wispy kind of way) there was also a definite outline of a man. We got freaked so we left and ate outside.

As we ate we heard the screen door open and close (it had been locked from the inside and no one else was there besides us). After the door opened we heard the sound of footsteps on the deck we turned to see nothing but the distorted outline moving towards us. We got up and left.

The next day we continued the raking and finished... But still felt the entity watching us closely.

The following year October 2007 we were asked to rake again. Of course Chris, our friend Dirk said yes but this time we were prepared we were to stay the night. We brought an Ouija board, Video Cameras and a tape recorder and blank video Cassettes; we wanted to find this being- to see it.

We started the raking job as usual but got too excited to work so we set up our operations ""HQ"" we set cameras up throughout the house and kept one for ourselves. We toured throughout the house when the radio turned on by itself and the CD started to skip.

As the night progressed we felt as if were being watched again. We then found something interesting and old music box we turned it on with the Audio recorded... We played back the Audio and heard a woman rambling in an unidentifiable language.

We pulled out the Ouija- now I hate using them but I recorded the session. As the Ouija Session progressed we all felt like we were being watched by something. Something scary and it wanted us out of the house. Eventually Both Dirk and Chris lifted their hands off the Ouija and it started to move by itself! I then decided to get the Audio recorder and listen to the playback of the Session. After the session we listened to the Playback and heard laughing (not anyone of us) and random knocking.

By this time I'm freaked and I leave the house. Chris and Dirk stayed behind and never did tell me what else happened that night.

Never Staying Home Alone Again,"California, United States",Poltergeists / Physical Manifestations,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Poltergeists / Physical Manifestations :: Never Staying Home Alone Again

T his story happened a few years ago and I am sad to say that it is a little bit like The Ring 1.

My house is said to be haunted. Well, at least that is what I say. And we moved here when I was 14. Since then I always feel like I am not alone. Some nights I can see lights go on and off in my bathroom, or I smell horrible things when I am awake in my house. But this encounter with a ghost was the last straw.

It was a cold, rainy day and I had to let my dogs in the house before they froze to death. My mom was at work and my dad was at work, too. They both said that they will be coming home late so they gave me a list of what to do in order to be safe or just to keep the house in order. But the list was long and I was not looking forward to doing all of this stuff when I could be having fun playing around with nobody home.

When I was watching t.v I started to get the feeling like I wasn't alone after all. I felt a cold chill on my back and at the corner of my eye I started seeing shadows. I felt a little better when I saw that my dog was not barking or showing teeth at anything.

I went up to get some lemonade out of the fridge when suddenly as I walked forwards, it opened on demand. (this is where it gets to be like the movie The Ring 1.) So anyway, I walked around the counter in the middle to see if I could see anything in the fridge. Nothing was there so I just walked over there and closed it. But then I felt stupid because my lemonade was in there. After I got the lemonade I sat back down and watched more t.v.

As I started taking a sip, I could see in the reflection of the glass in my kitchen. I looked at the glass trying to see the kitchen fully now. And what I saw next made me have nightmares for a long long time. Looking at the glass I suddenly saw this black creature run straight across the kitchen counter. I gasped and right as I gasped my dog jumped up and started barking like crazy and showing warning teeth. I jumped up with all feet and arms on the couch watching my dog.

This is when it started getting freaky. All of a sudden my dog starts moving his head like he is watching something dance or run. His head is moving across the ceiling and then back down to the kitchen counter again. Then, my dog moved his head and stared straight at me. I screamed because I knew that this ghost was either right beside me or behind me. I ran to my room upstairs and locked the door. I start crying out of fear and listen to my dog bark like crazy. Then, all of a sudden, the barking stops.

My bedroom is big, but my bed is right in the corner near the window and the closet. I was sitting under the covers waiting to hear my dog bark again. It was all quiet. Then, I hear my dog scratching and barking even louder now at my door. There was only one meaning to this, the ghost was in my room.

Next thing I know I was woken up by my mother on the kitchen counter. She asked me what had happened and I told her the whole story. She then asked me why I was found on the counter. I told her that all I remember was passing out in my bed. She looked at me and smiled. Then she said, ""It's ok now sweetie, everything is fine now...""

W hen I was about 12 years old, my biggest accomplishment at that time was to be alone at home by myself. My brother was staying at a friends house, and my parents went to dinner with their friends. I was never scared of staying home alone. I enjoyed it a lot. I have a very vivid imagination, but this was something completely different. There were no outside influences to scare me, and I was just watching something normal on tv.

Our old house was a split level. We had a wall on the north side of the den that had the entertainment center and on the left of it were the stairs that lead to the basement and then left of that were the stairs that went to the second floor. Our couch, which I was sitting on at the time, was against the wall on the east side of the den close to the stairs.

As I was sitting on the couch, watching this show, I noticed something out of the corner of my eye. It was at the very top of the stairs in the unlit hallway. I literally just felt a chill down my spine (while writing that is). I turn my head to see this very tall dark man standing at the top of my stairs looking down at me. I say man because it didn't have any hair, and I believed it to be an actual person at the time. I couldn't even make a sound or anything. I jumped up from the couch and ran towards the kitchen. We had this bar type counter that came out of the wall on the southwest corner of the den that seperates it from the kitchen. I grabbed the phone and ducked down behind it.

I immediately called my dad. At the time I thought it was a burglar in my house that was going to kill me. My dad could tell how scared I really was, and he rushed home immediately. That was the longest 10-15 minutes of my life. It felt like I was waiting for hours, thinking at any time this man was about to come around the corner and kill me. As soon as my dad got there, he checked the entire house. He couldn't find anyone, and thought I made up the whole story. I couldn't sleep by myself for a few months after that, because he was standing right outside my bedroom. I thought it was some type of evil spirit out to get me. I didn't ever see it again, but I always felt something watching me while I was trying to sleep. I used to pray every night for God to put a ""ghost blanket"" over me so that nothing could touch or harm me while I was trying to fall asleep, and also while I was sleeping. I know it sounds weird, but it gave me comfort as a child so that I could fall asleep without fear of something trying to ""get"" me.

We moved out of that house a year later, and I never had those types of feelings again. It wasn't until then that I realized it wasn't just some childhood fear of ghosts, but that you CAN actually feel the presence of spirits or ghosts. It churns my stomach every time I think about it. I'm not sure if it was an evil spirit or just one that liked to watch over me, but it certainly scared me. If I had to give an accurate description of the man, I'd say he was about a 6 ft tall black figure with dark baggy clothes, little or no hair on his head, and I couldn't see any other facial features. It was almost like a shadow or something. And I could ""feel"" his eyes but I couldn't see them if that makes any sense. I'd love to hear your comments or suggestions about what happened. Thank you so much for reading.

The Midnight Demon,Canada,Old Hags / Night Attacks / Sleep Paralysis,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Old Hags / Night Attacks / Sleep Paralysis :: The Midnight Demon

T his story is a little different from my other ones because it involves just me. May 2007, 2 Months after my first true love broke up with me, I hit a stage of depression that I didn't want to get out of (I don't know if that has any significance at all).

Disturbances and sightings increased; I would literally see outlines walking the street and feel temperature drops in heat waves. Even see faces in windows that no one else could see, but this is just the beginning of my story. I was so depressed sometimes I would see black in the darkness of night, if you know what I mean... Basically a space when it was dark out side that was darker than night.

These appeared in several places: the downstairs living room, my room, and my grandparents house. The entity's appeared through out May and June.  Finally by June 8th, 2007, it came (the exact date stands out in my mind because it scared me so much).

I was asleep and I had this dream that something horrible was chasing me. I couldn't see what it was but it felt evil. It then grabbed me (in my dream) with a 5 fingered clawed hand. I WOKE UP (because I felt actual pain in my leg) to see the dark swirling shapeless mass swirling above my body. I quickly grabbed my crucifix from my side table my grandparents had bought at the Vatican. I recited the Lord's Prayer over and over and over. What ever it was screeched and screamed and let go of my leg and vanished.

I passed out again and woke up with 5 scratches on my leg. I still don't know where they came from but it scared me a lot. I went to my Minister to find out answers. She told me that her grandmother had seen something like that when her husband died. I was freaked out... Someone was going to die, I thought... Sure enough a few weeks later My grandma Watt died a week before her 101st birthday.

I ask anybody what do you think that thing was doing over my bed? And basically attacking me?

The Presence At Dad's Apartment Building,"Massachusetts, United States",Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: The Presence At Dad's Apartment Building

I n 1982 I was 14 years old. My Dad had just purchased an old apartment building that was built in the very early 1900s. There wasn't a significant amount of history to this building but I do know that it was built at another location and then moved to the current neighborhood it sits in by an old fashioned horse-drawn trailer.

Once papers were passed, my Dad went about the building making repairs and renovating rooms. One evening I had gone over to check out the building. Both my parents were there cleaning in one of the vacant first floor apartments. My Dad asked me if I would finish cleaning the kitchen cabinets while he walked around and introduced my Mom to the current tenants. I agreed and started scrubbing the cabinets with a sponge. They were coated by many layers of dirt and grease. I was thinking to myself that whoever had lived there really left a little to be desired in the cleaning department.

I continued to scrub away and then I got this feeling that I was being watched. I kept looking behind me. Nothing. The hairs on the back of my neck were starting to stand up. I continued to scrub the dirty cabinets. There was a small pantry behind me. All of the sudden I heard a creaking sound. I looked and the pantry door had opened by itself. I was starting to get a bit spooked and was really hoping my parents would get back there. The wind outside started to pick up as well and was shaking the storm windows. This effect was only fueling my growing fear of the place.

Suddenly I couldn't take the feeling of being watched anymore. I felt like someone was standing behind me, just glaring at me. I didn't feel welcome. I dropped the sponge into the bucket, climbed off the step stool I was on, and went out into the backyard. How was I going to explain this one to my parents?

Eventually my parents returned to the first floor apartment. They called to me to come back in. They of course wanted to know why I hadn't finished cleaning. I was trying to explain and then burst into tears. They both stared at me puzzled. ""Come here..."" my Dad said concerned. ""Tell us what the matter is...""

I could not force myself to cross that threshold if my life depended on it. ""I can't!"" I cried. I would take a step forward and I just could not make myself go in there. Finally I returned to the backyard with my parents following me. When asked to explain, all I could say was, ""something doesn't feel right..."" I had no other explanation than that. I hadn't really seen anything besides the pantry door open but that could have been explained away by the wind causing a draft, right? My 14 year old mind was having a very hard time rationalizing all this.

When I had calmed down a bit, my Mom drove me home. A few days later my Dad and I talked about what had happened. He told me that the apartment I had been in had been occupied by the previous owner. The woman had died in that very apartment, and the apartment building went up for sale. She had also gone blind, which accounted for the apartment having many years worth of dirt and grease coating the cabinets. My Dad felt that maybe this woman was still in her apartment and did not realize she had passed. She maybe sensed/saw (I'm guessing) me in her apartment and thought I was intruding. I don't really know. I felt like whoever was there did not want me there.

While my Dad finished the renovations of the other apartments, he would sometimes feel like he was also being watched. A few times he would hear what sounded like coins dropping behind him only to find nothing of the sort there.

My Dad sold this building a year or two ago. As far as I know, nothing else has happened since that day almost 26 years ago. My sister lived there for a little while in the earlier part of this decade and I would sometimes stay with her when visiting back east. Neither she nor I ever experienced anything again there.

Perhaps in the beginning it was indeed the old lady watching us. I would like to think that once she realized that my Dad was there up keeping her old home that she was able to find peace and cross over. I will most likely never know.

A Ghost Once Walked my House at Night,Canada,Apparitions / Voices / Touches,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Apparitions / Voices / Touches :: A Ghost Once Walked my House at Night

S hort dreams I can't remember but long dreams I practically memorize. One night I had a long dream and remembered it- even the little details. Since I LOVE to write stories, I decided to base one of my stories on my dream.

In my dream there was a man. He had long dark brown hair and a reddish - pinkish shirt on. He was a guard.

I was sitting in my backyard two days ago and I was talking to my best friend on the phone. I was looking around the backyard while she was telling me something and my eyes fell upon my bedroom window. In the window I saw a tall man with see-through, white skin and long, dark brown hair. He was also wearing a reddish - pinkish shirt.

I couldn't believe it. I have never seen a man like that except for in my dream so I was pretty convinced that I had seen a ghost.

Also, when I was 11 and 12 at night, I would ALWAYS wake up to soft footsteps that seemed loud to me. I would look outside my door and see a shape of a tall man with a pointy nose outlined on the wall.  The man would ""walk"" up and down the hallway and then disappear. I was always scared but ignored it and went back to sleep.

Then, at the age of 13 I got a dog. The first night I had her, I woke up again to see the ghost. He turned to face me and I almost screamed. He was HIDEOUS!  He waved at me and disappeared.

I haven't seen him since but sometimes at night I wake up and hear my name being called. Also, sometimes my dog sniffs and licks the air and barks when there is nothing there. It's STRANGE! But I am completely convinced I have seen ghosts.

My Sister's Experiences,"Virginia, United States",Apparitions / Voices / Touches,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Apparitions / Voices / Touches :: My Sister's Experiences

T hese occurrences have taken place at my sister's house over the course of the past 3 years.

The house my sister and her family live in was built by her husband's grandfather. At some point, throughout the years, even in their adult lives, every one of his aunts and his uncle has lived in the house. His grandmother died in the house.

My sister is 4 years younger than I am. She isn't one to watch scary programs or things of that nature. Mostly because her husband works out of town a lot and he doesn't get home until well after dark.

The first attention grabber she had was about 3 years ago during one of these times when her husband was working in TN. She was at home with my niece, who was only 3 at the time. It was about 9pm and she heard sounds like someone walking across the floor of the attic. This scared her and she immediately got on the phone and called me. I told her that there was no way someone could be in the attic because it is so full of junk that you can barely pull the door down without stuff falling out of it. She was still terrified and I told her to pack up my niece and come on down to mom and dad's house. She arrived about 15 minutes later, still in tears. She stayed at mom and dad's house for the next 9 nights until her husband got back home.

About 2 1/2 years ago when she was pregnant with my twin nephews, she was in the kitchen fixing supper and out of the corner of her eye she saw what she thought was my niece run down the hall wearing a white cotton dress. She was about to get upset at Kaitlyn (my niece) for playing in her ""good clothes"" when she turned the corner, looked down the hallway and saw no one. She went to the front door and there was Kaitlyn outside playing in the yard wearing an old pair of denim shorts and a purple shirt.

She had mentioned these things to her husband and like some men he dismissed these occurrences as her ""seeing"" things or just her hormones being out of whack.

Last year she had taken my two nephews to the babysitter's house and went home to relax some while waiting for my niece's bus to arrive. She has a sectional sofa and the shortest end was what faced the TV. She had made herself some popcorn and was watching TV when she saw what looked like one of her son's heads slowly rise just enough so that about an inch was visible over the end of the sofa. Of course she freaked, she slowly peeked over the end of the sofa and nothing was there. She thought she was going crazy and sat back down to continue her program. This happened 2 more times and she finally went outside to wait for the bus.

This is the kicker: about 3 days ago her husband was in the kitchen making himself a sandwich. My two nephews were asleep on the couch, my sister was watching TV lying on the couch and my niece was at her other aunt's house. Her husband came into the living room and asked where the boys were. She told him to be quiet because they were both asleep and asked why he wanted to know. It is a clear shot view from the kitchen into their living room and he could see my sister sitting in there. He told her that while he was making his sandwich, he thought one of the boys was playing with the slide lock on the door that leads down into the basement. This lock has been on that door for years now and the part that bolts is very loose and makes a distinctive noise when you try to lock or unlock it. She told him that maybe he was ""hearing"" things or that maybe his hormones were out of whack. He didn't appreciate this in the least bit. She told him that these were the types of things that she had been dealing with for the last 3 years and that she was glad he had finally had something happen to him that couldn't be explained.

She has told me on several occasions that she thinks her house it haunted. When in the kitchen out of the corner of her eye she sees what looks like a man sitting on the end of her sofa. When she looks straight on, no one is there. She has never seen things while looking straight on except for the head thing.

Is there something in their house? Could it be his grandmother? My sister is getting to the point where she isn't feeling comfortable in her own house, she wants to move. I would love to hear some suggestions from you guys/girls as to things that we can do to help her feel more at ease.

Little Boy In The Dark,"Michigan, United States",Apparitions / Voices / Touches,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Apparitions / Voices / Touches :: Little Boy In The Dark

T he summer of 2007 (last year) I visited my grandma Debbie, But I call her G-mama.

G-mama was very young when she got pregnant, 13 to be exact. Soon she had 3 little girls. My aunt Kisha is the eldest, my mom was second, and then my aunt Tiah as the youngest. After having her first child she then got pregnant again. She gave my mom up for adoption. But she kept Kisha and Tiah. After my mom turned 16 she went out to find her biological mother and that is when she found G-mama.

It was last year when my family went up to Pentwater Michigan. I was in for a great summer, a very great and freaky summer-except my dad had divorced my mom when I was 3. But anyway, my G-mama was always asking if my mom and I would stay up and contact the Indians that roamed the Indian burial grounds in her backyard or to contact the spirits that roamed the house.

Finally we were in the mood to stay up. So at 11:00pm we all went outside and lit candles. Soon my G-mama was asking questions ""If you are really here show yourselves"" and other questions like that. It was not long until someone replied. My little cousin's toy truck sits on the other side of the porch- the porch goes all the way around the house. It never had batteries in it plus it rained a few nights ago so the thing shouldn't work even if it had batteries in it. Well it started to move back and forth. What scared me was that it started making fire sirens.

Of course my mom and G-mama were being mean and plus they were sorta drunk so they thought it was funny to send me down the porch and pick up the truck. I started to head down to the toy when out of the corner of my eye I saw shadow, so I turned to look for it but I had no success. Turning around to pick up the ball I had a sense of a little boy about 6 staring at me from my side. I ignored it and picked up the truck then I saw a shadow pass in front of me. I never ran so quick in my life, I ran all the way to the other side of the porch but I dropped the truck- how stupid am I?

My mom was starting to get very rude so I went inside. I finally fell asleep. The next night my little cousin Nash came outside- it was about 11:48pm. My G-mama asked him who was outside on the deck. He said there were children running up and down the deck. My cousin sees ghosts, lucky kid. I asked him if the ghost was a little blonde 6 year old and he said yes.

What do you think? Am I just crazy, was it just coincidence, or did I have another experience with the paranormal?

Possible Ghost Attack?,"Virginia, United States",Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: Possible Ghost Attack?

H ey, I'm a bit freaked out about what's been happening at my boyfriend's place, and I'm really confused if my last experience was possibly just my imagination or an actual encounter with a spirit of some sort. First let me start off with a few things that I've heard about that has happened in the apartment building.

My boyfriend, Josh, has had quite a few experiences in his parent's apartment as well as in the building. I've heard from him and his friend Marcus about seeing a little girl bouncing a ball in the hallway of the 13th floor, only to throw the ball towards them and the ball and girl just disappear. Honestly, I'm kind of skeptical of this story just because of the typical ""little girl bouncing ball"" and 13th floor stuff.

Another occurrence happened to Josh's dad in the middle of the night. He woke up smelling sulfur. He opened his eyes to see fireworks going off in his room. By the way he described it; there were actual fireworks, smoke and all. When he closed his eyes and went under the covers, the sounds stopped and he opened his eyes again and everything was normal. A few other things have happened to various friends of ours in his apartment, but that's kind of irrelevant to my experiences so let me get on with the point.

This is how the room was arranged when the first three things happened:

The first thing I ever saw in his room was a shadow-like figure standing by his little brother's toy chest. We were lying down in his bed talking about something, with his back against the wall and I was facing him, my back to the rest of the room. In the corner of my eye I see a figure. Since he has a little brother, and the height seemed just about right, my first assumption was that it was his brother. I looked over, at the same time Josh looked over, and there was nothing there. I would've thought that this was my mind and the darkness playing tricks on me, because the light was out. But, there was some light. The bathroom door is always open, and the light is always on, and he doesn't have a door to his room... He puts a sheet up, but it's thin enough so that you can see through it into the hallway.

This leads to the second thing I experienced there. We were watching TV in his room one night and I look towards the doorway because I see somebody behind the curtain. We both stare for a minute, and I thought that maybe his dad was trying to get in... Then one side of the sheet was tugged by the ""person,"" and when it fell there was nothing there. Not his dad, not even the shadow. It was just empty hallway.

Another time, I was there but didn't see it myself. Josh doesn't sleep well (living there, I can't blame him), and he was watching TV one night when I was asleep. He saw a person walk into the bathroom, and he heard the water turn on. He waited for a little bit because if it was his dad, the bathroom door would have been closed. After a few minutes of waiting and watching the hallway, he got up and went to the bathroom, only to find out that the water was on and nothing was in there. I wish he would have woken me up for this, but he says he didn't because I get freaked out really easily. He used to practice black magic, and he said he quit a while ago.

On to the main point... Like I said, he quit practicing black magic, and on Saturday he said he blessed his room so I don't have anything to worry about. He changed his room around, by the way, and this is what it looks like now:

Anyway, I decided to spend the night over at his house because it was raining and I didn't feel like driving home. Plus, he said that his room was safe, so I really wasn't worried. I remember exactly the time, because I was still freaked out despite his reassurances. I know that paranormal activity is more likely to happen around 3 am... I looked at my phone it read 2:48am. I told him to go to the kitchen and get some water before it turned to 3. I was teasing him just a little bit, making fun that his little spell wouldn't work. I guess that was a mistake on my part.

He went to get the water and we went to sleep. I was sleeping on the side of the bed close to the door, and I was facing the door. Josh was sleeping on the other side, facing my back. I had a really odd dream (which isn't relevant at all to anything paranormal) and I woke up. I was half-asleep, half-awake, I guess, and I opened my eyes and looked towards the doorway. Everything looked normal; the light from the bathroom was on, the curtain was up. I wasn't really looking for anything, just more of waking up and looking around like I usually do after weird dreams.

I closed my eyes again, and I got this really weird feeling that somebody just came into the room, so I open my eyes to look again. The instant I open my eyes, I feel an intense, pins-and-needles/slightly painful, electrifying feeling, and everything in the room is pitch black. It started at my toes, and it just washed upwards... It was really quick though, maybe in the matter of milliseconds. I had the feeling everywhere, but I know I could feel it surge up my body. I tried to move my feet first, and when I couldn't I tried to jump up, and I couldn't do that either. I tried to call out Josh's name, and nothing would come out. I couldn't talk, and then I tried to scream, and I couldn't do that. Then I noticed that I couldn't even breathe; it felt like something was on top of me, squeezing the air out of me and holding me down.

I was panicking, and after what felt like maybe 30 seconds I forced myself to calm down. I still don't know how I did it. As soon as I felt the feeling go away, it went as fast as it came, but this time down my body and ""out"" of my toes. I jumped up and started gasping for air. This woke up Josh, who jumped up and was ready to beat somebody up. After he realized that nothing was in the room, he asked what was wrong and eventually I told him. I feel like he didn't believe me; I don't even know if I believe it myself. I don't know if it was just a really real dream, or if it was paranormal.

Before this, Josh had had many experiences. It seems like where he goes weird things just happen. Most of my friends who hang out with him have at least one story of something creepy happening. Maybe it's because he practiced black magic? Or maybe it's because his best friend killed herself less than a month ago, and maybe she doesn't like me. He says that weird things stopped happening in his house, at least until I've been going there recently. He's not scared of spirits, and he's told me that if I'm scared then I'm more likely to be affected. Maybe that's why this happened to me, and not him?

I don't know. All I know is that I'm not going back there for a while.

If anybody has any feedback, it would be greatly appreciated...

Grandmothers Goodbye,"California, United States",Family / Friends Visits,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Family / Friends Visits :: Grandmothers Goodbye

G rowing up I've had quite a few ghost experiences. I thought I'd share one more with everybody. My dad was driving me to my Auntie's place. I was going there to hang with my cousin, Codie. The town they lived in was the same town where his mom, my grandmother lived and died. So I thought of paying a visit to my grandmother's grave for the 1st time.

We got to my Auntie's place around 4pm. When I got there I got somewhat of a bad feeling. A feeling like someone was there. But I quickly dismissed the feeling, and played with my cousin, who by the way was only 4, but we got along great.

I asked Codie if he felt like something was watching us. His answer was ""Yep! Grammy is watching us!"" I know he was only 4, but I believed him. So the rest of the day I was thinking about ""Grammy"".

I stayed the night there and the next day I asked my dad to take me to Grandmother's grave. He did. He also brought Auntie and Codie. When we got to the grave Codie and I quickly ran over to Grandmothers grave. How we knew which her grave was? I didn't know.

My dad and Auntie stayed behind checking out some other graves. But then Codie shook my arm and pointed into the distance. I was looking at my dad but turned my head and there she was, my grandmother Sheela. I knew it was her from the pictures my dad showed me.

She was so beautiful. It stunned me. ""Beautiful... Goodbye..."" Is all she said. She had such a beautiful voice. Grandmother died before I was born, I think all she wanted to do was see me and say her last goodbye to me and Codie, since we were the only ones in the family never to see her.

I now know grandmother Sheela is watching over me. No one can replace her. She was a strong Christian, so I believe she is in heaven watching me. Making sure I'm alright.

Harding Street,"Virginia, United States",Apparitions / Voices / Touches,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Apparitions / Voices / Touches :: Harding Street

W hen I was 16, I was in an accident where I was turning into my boyfriend's house and a lady ran out of the road and hit me while I was in his driveway. Her front bumper was hanging off her car and she totaled mine. After the state trooper came and listened to both of our statements, I ended up getting a ticket. The state trooper and her husband were in the same golf club together. Being upset, I told her that was ok because hers was coming. What I meant by that, I don't even know. In all of my anger, it just sounded good at the time.

Fast forward 6 years. My husband and I had just separated and I was living with a lady that I worked with. She had 3 children and she stayed at her boyfriends house most of the time. It worked out well for the both of us. The house that we lived in had been turned into 2 apartments. Both apartments were 2 stories. The downstairs of ours had a living room, kitchen, bedroom, and bathroom. The upstairs had 3 bedrooms and a bathroom. It was base board heat so we used kerosene heaters to heat the place, it was a lot cheaper.

One night in particular I was there by myself. I had never had any strange feelings about the place or felt eerie while staying by myself. I had closed the door to the kitchen and the door that led to the little hallway and had the heater going. I was lying on the sofa watching TV and decided that I was too tired to finish watching the show so I turned over facing the back of the couch. My eyes were still open when I noticed that the reflection of the flame on the back of the couch had dimmed. Almost like if you are at a campfire and someone walks in front of you how the flame will dim. I am laying on my right side and in my left ear I hear the words, ""Yours is coming"". Not once, but three times in a row: yours is coming, yours is coming, and yours is coming.

I immediately flipped over and no one was there. This freaked me out bad! I was in tears and called down to my mom and dads house. My dad answered the phone and asked me what was wrong. I explained to him what had just happened and he said, ""You better start praying"". I got off the phone with him and dropped straight down on my knees and prayed like I had never prayed before. After being down there for 15 minutes, I stood up with the most wonderful feeling of calm. I lay right down and went straight to sleep.

Nothing else ever happened for the rest of the time I lived there. The one thing that I still can't do to this day is sleep on a sofa without my back being against the back of it.

I was doing things and hanging around with people that weren't the best influence on me at the time. Could this have been my conscience trying to help me or could it have been something else?

The Few Experiences I've Had Alone,"Oklahoma, United States",Apparitions / Voices / Touches,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Apparitions / Voices / Touches :: The Few Experiences I've Had Alone

T he first one goes way back.I've had asthma since I was real small. One day, I stopped breathing, and I was awake, but I saw my parents carrying me out of my room. I followed asking them what was wrong. My mom was crying and my dad was screaming,""Get to the truck! Get to the truck!"".

I heard some thing behind me calling my name, and it was this little troll like figure, saying,

It scared me, so I kept trying to follow my parents. I remember running behind them saying wait for me. The troll kept calling me, so I turn, and tell it I can't play right now. The only thing is, when my parents got into the truck, I was still outside of it. They backed out of the parking spot, and started driving. I climbed up in the back of the truck, the troll thing close behind, and I got to the window, and just kind of, fell threw it. This is a 1972 dodge truck, so it doesn't have the little back window opening or anything like that.

After that, I remember waking up, and my mom was holding my hand, and she was crying, and she pressed my hand to the glass and said some thing, but I didn't see anything but walls of Lava and fire outside the truck window, then I remember waking up in the hospital, and getting a sucker, and a balloon. To this day, I'm not certain if I had actually died, or was dieing at that point. I was about 3 years old, because it was before my mom went back to work the first time. I asked my mom about it, and she remembers that day, but has no explanation as to how I could have seen them carrying me, or as to what it was chasing me. She said my lips were turning blue, and my eyes were glazed.

When I was about 15, I had my first bout of sleep paralysis. The only thing was, when I woke up to the fact I couldn't move. I felt this heavy breathing on me, and this loud, raspy voice yelling in my ear. I started crying. I was scared. At first, I thought I was having a nightmare, but as I kept trying to move, the more my body would hurt, and the louder the yelling would get. I heard my bedroom door open, only to see my mom walking through out the room, anointing the house; she then bent over me, and anointed me on my forehead, and left hand, then my left foot.

As soon as my mom did that, whatever it was holding me down, and yelling, quit. My mom anointed my little brother as well (we shared a room for a little while, since it was only a 2 bedroom trailer). She then, sat at the foot of our bunk bed, and said that it came into her room first, but she chased it out, and then started praying through out the house.

I told her what was happening before she came in, and she said that after anointing her room, she decided to come to our's, to make sure we were okay. She anointed me first, since I was right there at arms reach. She said that while she was anointing me, she heard it a few times yelling and cussing her.

I've had other experiences, but I think this is enough for now. I will tell the rest another time.

Demon at My Work Place,United Kingdom,Demons / Possessions / Exorcisms,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Demons / Possessions / Exorcisms :: Demon at My Work Place

T o understand this story you would have needed to read my last one as I explain in it that I can see spirits and now I have just found out I can see much darker things also. I guess I should also explain that only the women in my family on my mother's side have this gift and the men can only sense them.

I work part time in a restaurant near my home. One morning I was on cleaning duty at this place which starts at 9am and I had to clean the whole restaurant. I was told by a girl that works there that the Gent's toilets is haunted so I thought no big deal I'm used to this kind of thing.

I happily go into the Gent's toilets and begin to clean the mirrors in the toilets. I suddenly hear the toilet door behind me slam against the wall. I turn around and say. ""Please do not do this to me, I just want to clean in here s can you leave me in peace..."" I went back to the mirrors and suddenly the room got even colder.

I turn around a little annoyed and speak to it again. ""Stop this now. That is an order, go stand in the corner..."" I tell it and turn back around.

Suddenly all the taps are pressed down and the toilets flush. I sigh and turn around again and talk to it. ""Look this isn't going to scare me so behave..."" .

As I stand there a dark shadow appears in the corner of the toilets and I stand there watching it trying to keep calm. I hear this strange hissing like noise and the doors of the toilets started smashing against the wall like something out of a horror film and I suddenly feel this pressure on my neck.

I felt like I couldn't breathe so I stood there and pleaded for it to leave me alone, I asked for whatever forces of light that could protect me to do so and the thing released its grip and vanished.

I calmly walked out of the bathroom and started crying in front of my boss. Some people from the restaurant went in there to see if they could see anything but couldn't.

I got a cup of coffee and was sent home soon after. I have left my job because every time I went into the restaurant I kept feeling like I was being watched and I kept feeling tickling sensations around my throat.

I have been looking at other stories on this website and come to think that it may have just been a demon I'm not to sure what it was.

Orbs and a Loud Latin Lady Voice,United Kingdom,Apparitions / Voices / Touches,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Apparitions / Voices / Touches :: Orbs and a Loud Latin Lady Voice

I no longer live in the house where this took place but I am still disturbed by the things that happened there and would really like anyone to give me their opinion on it and why it all happened.

It was a brand new house which had no previous occupants. I was the first to live there with my partner and young son. It started with orbs. I wasn't able to *see* them with the naked eye but there were literally hundreds photographed with my digital camera in every room of the house, particularly the living room and master bedroom, but also in my son's room and the kitchen. I wasn't frightened of having so many orbs showing up on all my photos, more intrigued.

Strange things started to happen in the last 18months of living there, and these just got stronger and more intense until I felt there was a constant presence, there all the time, watching and listening to everything I did. Things were moved in the kitchen, eggs, plates and cups (not in a poltergeist manner) discretely when I wasn't looking! This didn't bother me so much.

Then one evening my partner and I were sitting together in the living room and out of the kitchen came a very loud MECHANICAL-sounding woman's voice. But it was impossible to make out what the woman was saying. We looked at each other, both realising that neither of us had imagined the loud robotic voice, but ultimately nothing else occurred that evening so we were not overly concerned.

Literally a few days later I was in the upstairs bathroom, alone in the house. I heard a loud voice coming from directly behind me to the right side of me (as if they were sitting on the basin!) of a mature woman (I would say in her 50's+) speaking in a foreign language, although this time the voice was not at all mechanical or robotic sounding.

I was listening intently to what the voice was saying but couldn't understand as it was in a foreign language which sounded to me like Spanish or something. The voice carried on for maybe 10-15 seconds (it felt like a long time) and I caught the last part of what she said and it sounded Latin! I know it sounds crazy or corny, but the voice said something like ""Ella est dominus"" which in Latin I found means ""She is the Master"" (of the house) or something of that sort. I was petrified! I moved from the house a couple of months later as things intensified afterwards, although I didn't hear the voice again!

I am now in a new house where nothing like this has happened and I can capture no orbs in any photographs of the house using the same camera! Please comment on what you think this was all about?

Becky Hates Me,"Ohio, United States",Photographs / Videos / EVP,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Photographs / Videos / EVP :: Becky Hates Me

H ello again. I have yet another little EVP clip for your review. I normally do not show any clips that have been altered, but this one I had (the minimum) noise removal taken out due to the fact that when you put this on Youtube, it loses some quality. You will hear a little ""beeping"" sound throughout, that is the effect of ""Noise Removal"" in Audacity (computer program for EVP reviewing). Before I get to the ""Story"", I want to say that in doing EVP's I get A LOT of ""Help Me"" requests by the ""Spirits"". We live in a 100 year old farm house and in recording in my daughters bedroom, we heard ""Help Me"" upon playback. I research EVPs but I am not heartless. Upon hearing this, I went back to her room ant told her to find the light and go to it. She would have friends and loved ones on the other side. This must not have been the advice that she (Becky) was looking for. About a week later in my sons room we captured the first recording of ""I hate you"". This was on 12-13-07 at around 9 PM. A few seconds after that (on the same recording) you can hear a guy say ""Follow Becky"". I did not include that part because it is too hard to hear with headphones let alone on Youtube. A while back we recorded in my daughters bedroom and asked for the ""Spirits"" to tell us their name. We caught the word ""Henry"". So I assume the male is named ""Henry"".

A week after the first recording, I again recorded in my sons room we caught the second EVP. A different sounding voice says ""Becky hates you"". (Recorded on 12-18-07 at around 9 PM.) Hence, we have the following entities in our home:

1) Becky - She doesn't like me in particular. (I sat on the floor in the dark once while my son stood next to me and recorded. You can hear her say ""Get up"", angrily. Thus, she doesn't like me.)

4) Unknown German Male - He is the one from my first story that activated my infants' Elmo toy. Never heard from him again.

Our home was built in the early 1900's. It was physically moved to this location in 1950. My next door (country) neighbors family has owned it (until we purchased it from them) since 1950. Nobody named Henry or Becky has lived there since 1950. Before 1950, I don't know. I have told them that they are welcome to stay. Don't bother us and we will do likewise. I have never heard foot steps, shadows, apparitions, eerie feelings...etc. So don't have pity on us. We cohabitate well with our other residence. Even though we may not always get along.

Comment if you would like more posts. I enjoy relating our Paranormal experiences with you.

The Forsythia Bushes,"West Virginia, United States",Orbs / Lights / Mists,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Orbs / Lights / Mists :: The Forsythia Bushes

I t was Easter Sunday, 1992. I was seven years old. All of my mom's brothers and sisters and their children had gathered at my maternal grandmother's house like usual. After lunch, the adults had an egg hunt for all the kids. Anyway, the egg hunt was over, and all my cousins and I were headed to the back yard to collect our ""prizes"". For some reason, I stopped about 20 yards short of the group and stared at the hillside.

The back of my grandmother's back yard was (and still is) lined with forsythia bushes. The bushes were not in full bloom, but were starting to bloom. From what I remember about the sun, it had to have been around 3 or 4 o'clock in the afternoon.

Anyway, as I stared into the bush, this white shape, neither solid nor transparent, started forming out of nowhere. It seemed to be spinning, while it expanded and contracted. At this time, I became aware that there was a very tall presence behind me (almost touching me, I could almost feel body heat). I thought the presence was my older cousin, who was a teenager, and twice my height. So I spun around and said, ""Lee, look at that!"" and spun back around. Instantaneously, I realized that Lee was not behind me and never had been and the white ""blob"" was gone. I felt alone again. I looked over and realized my family was some distance off and had not seen or noticed a single thing.

I think it needs to be said now, that I am very skittish. I'm terrified of the dark and always have been. Just the thought of possibly seeing a ghost or demon or presence scares me. I've always been like that. However, in this situation, I was calm, more than calm, I was serene.

I know at some point in time, I told my mother, grandmother, aunt, and father about this. For a long time they tried to convince me that I was saw a cat or a grocery bag in the wind. I always maintained that it was an unknown form. Years past and my mother would occasionally bring this topic up with me (she's had a lot of supernatural experiences herself) to see if I remembered anything else. My story has always been the same. However, she pointed out something about 6 months ago that I had never realized. For years, I had put emphasis on the blob. It had never occurred to me that I had not been mistaken about my cousin's presence behind me. Perhaps I just couldn't see the presence. Then she suggested that the presence could have been her father.

He had died when my mother was 5 or 6. My mother and I are practically identical. So much so, that (in my adult life) I've seen pictures of her and thought they were me. My mother suggests that the presence was her father just checking up on his little girl. For some reason, this helped put the mystery of why I saw the blob to bed. Now I feel like I understand, or at least have a more complete understanding.

The Ghost Under The Kitchen Sink,"California, United States",Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: The Ghost Under The Kitchen Sink

T his story is a little bit shorter than my other stories but I hope that it catches your attention.

I was about 20 at the time (4 years ago) and I was sort of used of some paranormal activity going on in my big house. But there is this one thing that I couldn't quite put my finger on. Here is what happened.

It was a Friday night and I was washing my dishes in the sink. I accidentally forgot to get the sponge out so I went to go get it under the sink. As I got it, I purposely left the door to the drawer open because I had to put it back inside real soon. As I finished my last dish I went to put away the sponge... But the door had already closed. I thought inside my head ""That's funny. I never heard it close..."" I thought that it was nothing after awhile and I sat down at my computer doing some research.

My computer is in my room which is upstairs. So I was looking up some research for my friend Erin when I started hearing cupboards opening and closing. I walked down to the kitchen and nothing had been touched.

The next night I was in my room again doing research on my computer when I heard the same thing again. No one was home, and my dogs were outside. I went down AGAIN and checked up on what it was. Nothing had been touched, nothing had been moved, nothing had an abnormal look to it. This made me angry.

Later that night I heard it happen again and so I decided that I would just stay down in the kitchen so whenever something happens, I would be there to see it. I was waiting, and waiting, and waiting. I almost fell asleep when I heard the slamming again. I quickly jumped up and followed the sound. It came from the drawer under the kitchen sink.

Out of curiosity, I opened it up and looked inside. There was this green slime inside that looked like it was leaking from the sink pipe. I hurried to the sink and turned it on to see what would come out. Water. I looked back under the sink again and there was no slime anymore. I sat down and stared at it thinking what would happen next. Suddenly, they closed and when I tried to open them, it wouldn't budge.

So this is the story of the ghost under the kitchen sink. It is not that scary but I thought that all of you ghost lovers enjoyed it.

Drip Drop Drip Drop,"California, United States",Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: Drip Drop Drip Drop

T he month was May and we had May showers. So it was pouring rain and our whole city got up to 6 inches of rain.

It was getting late and I was putting on my pajamas and about to go up and brush my teeth when I heard something. Since it was raining I guess that it was perfectly normal to have some leaks in your ceiling. But this got me concerned because I heard loud noises like Drip Drop Drip Drop. I checked all over before I headed for the hay to see if I could find any water on the ground-nothing. I looked all over the house, in the attic, and found nothing. So I went to sleep.

But right before I actually went to sleep my eyes were closed but I was thinking about a lot of stuff in my head so I couldn't quite sleep yet. So as I was lying down in my bed, I started hearing the Drip Drop sound again. It seemed like it was not far from my room at all. So I got up and looked around the hallway where my bedroom is at.-nothing. I went to my bed and fell asleep.

The next morning I woke up and got dressed. As I picked out my clothes, I felt like I was being watched. It's hard to live in an old house alone without having the feeling like you are not alone. But I got dressed and then headed down for the kitchen for breakfast. As I came down the stairs I noticed footsteps. But these weren't footsteps that were clear. They sounded like someone had water on their shoe and walked inside the house which made me feel like someone was in my house.

As it started getting dark the rain came in again. I went to every room and every door and locked up everything just to make sure that won't happen again. After everything was locked I hopped into my pajamas and headed for bed. As my eyes were closed I heard that Drip Drop sound again. This only lasted a few minutes. I got so mad that I yelled ""Stop!""

In the morning I awoke to find the wet footsteps again. But this time they were at my door. And they looked fresh. I didn't feel like having breakfast at my house this morning so I went out to get a coffee. As I came back I went to go see if the footsteps were still there. They were surprisingly gone. The whole rest of the day I went about with a rag and looked for wetness around my house.

This wet feet thing stopped after about a month. Every night I would yell out for the Drip Drop sounds to go away and they would. And then one day they just didn't even come. And the wet footsteps were gone too. I got better nights of sleep and I didn't have to worry about that anymore.

Dogs and Cats Chase Each Other Even When Dead,Canada,Pets / Animals,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Pets / Animals :: Dogs and Cats Chase Each Other Even When Dead

W ell I told all of you about Senta's death in my first story. For everyone who hasn't read it, Senta was my German Shepherd that had to be put down due to her age and arthritis.

She has been making appearances throughout the winter and spring. I still see her to this day. In fact I saw her outline just last night.

Anyways, getting to the point, she has been appearing in usual spots like a few weeks ago I was walking upstairs at night and she was lying in the stairwell as usual which surprised me actually cause I almost ""tripped"" over her.

The main point is that in about January of this year good old 2008, my cats Justa and Fluffy had been acting odd and still do to this day. Some days Justa stares into blank space and watches something walking down the hallway. When Senta was alive her and Justa used to fight a lot. I have seen Justa swing at the air with his paws and hiss for no reason then run away. He sometimes walks around the spots Senta slept in almost like she is there.

Now the other cat is weirder... Fluffy has honestly shown Senta-like behavior for the past few months. She sleeps where Senta does lays like Senta would, she even attacks Justa now... I don't know if it is actually Senta taking on another form to say hi.

Night Attacks,Ireland,Succubus / Incubus / Sexual Ghosts,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Succubus / Incubus / Sexual Ghosts :: Night Attacks

I am not religious but believe in good and bad. I also know if something attacks I have got no faith to protect myself. I do realize that this is a problem but can't put my faith into either side.

My problem is I have been having dreams where someone or something is using me for sex. At first I thought it was a dream and this was the best sex dream I ever had but the second time I dreamed this, I got worried since it does not really feel like a dream.

After the third night I really got scared since this is not normal. It only happens when I am alone at night. Dream or no dream when I wake up, it looks like I have been swimming, so wet my hair is- I have to change my bed sheets and pillows. It feels so real that I told my husband (who works only night shift). I am too scared to sleep so I would rather stay up through the night which is a problem.

I have not had a good night's rest unless during day time. This got so much out o control that at night wherever I am, there has to be some kind of light on. If the lights are off, I don't go near the room. My husband thinks I am crazy and he laughs at me, but this is something I don't know how to handle.

At this moment I am looking for a night shift work to prevent myself from sleeping. Is there any way I can sort this problem out? I read that I can use salt around my bed, will that work?

The Lovely Piano,"California, United States",Apparitions / Voices / Touches,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Apparitions / Voices / Touches :: The Lovely Piano

W hen I was around 11, I started to really like old-time classic music. So I really wanted to go to a friend's house, Joel's house, because he played classic music on his piano. I was really happy to hear my Mom say I could. So I got on my bike and started to go over there.

When I finally got there Joel let me in, went over to his piano, and played. He played for around 15 minutes then took a break. Joel was in his bedroom and me in the kitchen trying to find something to eat, when I heard a piano playing. I thought it was Joel because it was coming from the living room (where the piano was).

When I heard the piano I went into the living room and I saw 2 men. One guy playing the piano who looked around15 yrs old (he was VERY handsome) and another guy on the floor who was just listening- he looked around 20. I thought he might have been family of Joel. ""You're very good"" is the only thing I said. The piano guy took a quick look at me( he had blue eyes with black hair), and turned his head over to the stairs. Joel was walking down.

I ran over to the stairs, looked at Joel and pointed at the 2 men and said ""Your family is really good!"" But when I turned my head I saw no one. The 2 men were gone. I asked him if he heard the piano playing and he replied with a no which confused me. I asked him if he had family over. Again, he said no. I asked him if he knew a guy with black hair and blue eyes. Surprisingly, he said yes. He said it was an ancestor that died long ago. I was surprised, he actually knew his ancestors. I knew none of mine but Joel said his name was Nicholas.

I was really happy I got to meet Nicholas but I don't know why I could see and hear him and Joel couldn't hear him. And I don't know why Nicholas and the other man left. But I was happy I got to listen to their music because the piano sounded wonderful.

I'm grateful for that day. I don't know why exactly, but I am. I always wish I could listen to Nicholas' piano playing again. I know that sounds VERY weird, but it's true. It sounded much different then what you hear nowadays. Whenever I go to Joel's house I can still sense someone there. I have yet to see Nicholas again, but I wish I could listen to his music one more time or at least Joel play more music like that.

Ghost Girl,"Virginia, United States",Misc,"I have a house that was built about five years ago. In the woods there are these mounds. I did some research and found out they are Native American burial grounds. I had a feeling though that one really stood out, one of a Native American princess.

I told my sister about it and she didn't believe me. So her and her friend went to try to dig it up. They really didn't get anywhere- not even half a foot deep into the ground. I told them they shouldn't have done that because it would upset the spirit of that body.

Then about a year later my friend was over and we were watching TV. All of the sudden my body just told me to turn my head and I did and saw this really clear very detailed apparition of a native American girl come out of my closet and float to my night stand and then vanished.

Then I told my friend what I saw and right after I was done talking, the TV just turned off. So then it was time for my mom to take him back home. We arrived at his house and my mom got out to talk to his mom about something.

We stayed in the car and talked. Then all of a sudden the door knobs and locks to the car started to go up and down and loudly going chiga chiga chiga.  The car was in my mom's fanny pack and it was impossible for what happened to happen.

When I got home I told my mom about it and she said she didn't hear anything. Can someone tell me how that is? And every night the ghost moves this plate sideways. In the morning my mom always straightens it but every night it turns again.

Strange Things Go Bump in the Night,"Alabama, United States",Apparitions / Voices / Touches,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Apparitions / Voices / Touches :: Strange Things Go Bump in the Night

A s I told Rhodes68, I was having a bad feeling before going to sleep last night after reading one of her stories. I made sure I calmed myself down before trying to go to sleep. I knew my mind would play tricks on me, thinking I might have seen something go by my bed or something like that. But what happened was no stretch of my imagination. I even had to bring my dog in as I know she has ""seen"" things before, but I will go ahead and tell you that she was no use other than just taking up space on my bed.

So I find myself starting to calm down, and I decide to turn off my television and try to get some sleep. I'm laying there for about 15 minutes or so when I hear this strange thud. It happened at 4:50 am. I know because I immediately looked at my clock and decided to take note of this occurrence. My heart started pounding a little. And this very strange feeling comes over my body. It feels like every inch of my bones are being pushed outward from inside me. I assumed something must have fallen, or there was an equally good explanation. I disregarded the sound and even the strange feeling I had and tried to go back to sleep. It sounded as if it came from the garage which is about 15 yards away from my room.

I have lived in this house for almost 8 years coming this October, and I have NEVER heard a noise like this. I am very familiar with the noises my house makes. I wouldn't even be telling you all this if it was the only occurrence of course, as it could be easily disregarded as a normal noise and just my imagination getting the best of me. But just as I got done telling this Mickey guy to be careful what he asks for, I ignored my very own advice. Thinking I was brave enough I began to ask (in my head, not aloud), ""If this is some kind of spirit please make that noise again, so that I know it wasn't a random occurrence..."" I also began to pray, ""God, if this IS a spirit, please don't let it enter my room, harm, touch, or manifest itself in my presence...""

Before I could even finish the last word of my prayer the loud thud happens once more. I literally started shaking uncontrollably and began praying again. It came at about 4:54 am. This is the first time since I have moved in this house that I prayed for the ""ghost blanket"". I could still feel the presence of something as I prayed. I began feeling cold gusts of wind, and yes my fan is ALWAYS on, but this wasn't just a gust from the fan it was very different.

It was also accompanied by extremely hot flashes. I almost broke out in a sweat. I began to take off my shirt, and not just because of the hot flashes. I have a cross tattoo on my back, and I thought it would hinder off any bad spirits. I made sure it was visible and then began to calm down a little. I knew I shouldn't have asked for such a thing if I was not ready to hear this spirit communicate, and I immediately regretted my decision. I hear my dog kind of whimper, but this was in the back of my mind, because I am still feeling very uneasy at the moment. My eyes stayed open until sunrise.

And if THAT wasn't enough, as I am laying there still very afraid, I hear something in my head. I don't know if any of you have ever been spoken to by a ""higher power"", but every time I have heard a voice it seems to come from inside my head. And the voice, in a loud whisper, says, ""You have been chosen..."" I FREAK! I immediately begin to ask over and over again. ""Chosen for what? Chosen for WHAT?"" And then I hear, ""You will see..."" This occurred at 5:15 am. I don't know what this means, and I am scared to find out.

Has anyone ever had this kind of thing happen to them? I am still very scared, and I'm not sure what to do about this right now. I don't know if I could handle being a medium or anything like that. Is there anyway to get over this fear of spirits? I don't even think that's what it meant, but I am still very scared of what it COULD mean. I guess I will find out in my own time, but if any of you have some help to offer, PLEASE tell me anything and everything you can, preferably from personal experiences or from something you have heard similar to this. ALL opinions are welcome though. I hope I didn't bring these things into my house.

On the lighter side, I was able to fall asleep shortly after the sun came up, and I didn't have any bad dreams. I don't exactly remember any of them, but I know they weren't anything disturbing. Thank you all for reading and God bless

Angel  Watching Over Us,"Arizona, United States",Apparitions / Voices / Touches,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Apparitions / Voices / Touches :: Angel  Watching Over Us

A bout 5 years ago I was in a very difficult marriage. My ex husband was mentally and physically abusive, mostly to me, but on occasion to our young daughter. He was an alcoholic and would often go into these fits of rage and throw things and display very scary behavior.

I was raised in a solid Christian home and I really felt a lot of evil in my ex husband. So one night when he left for the bar I immediately grabbed my anointing oils and I began praying and anointing every doorway and window, making sure to cover my daughter's doorway inside and out. While she would sleep, I would anoint her bed and her and pray that no evil could harm her.

We lived in this house for 5 years and after that incident of anointing when my ex husband would go into his fits he could not enter my daughter's room, at all.

There was a night it was VERY late, my ex was out drinking, my daughter was sleeping in her room with the door closed and I was sitting on the couch at the end of our hallway. I caught something out of the corner of my eye. Thinking I was just paranoid as I often was because of the abuse I quickly looked to see what was there. At the end of the hallway which was probably 25 feet from me, it was a small home, I saw very vividly a young child all in white with a BRIGHT light all around it. He looked right at me and I was overcome with a total peace. He started walking towards my daughter's room. I walked down the hall and he was gone.

The next day my daughter woke up and was so happy and calm she stated there was an angel in her room and he said we would be OK. She said that he held her hand and hugged her.

A couple weeks later I left my ex husband and took my daughter. We moved into our own apartment and I again anointed every window and every door. After our first night there my daughter woke up and said Mom our angel is back, he was in my room again last night. I have seen him several more times prior to meeting and marrying my husband. I hope that he still knows that his presence is always appreciated.

Weird Senses,"Maryland, United States",Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: Weird Senses

F ive years ago my family moved into the house where we currently live. Less than a month later moods changed. My brother and I began to rebel towards my parents. I will admit that our relationship wasn't the best but it's gotten ridiculous. I began feeling depressed and screaming for no reason.

This was all disregarded seeing as I was 13 and brother 17, along with the stress of moving. Then one day I was home alone. My parents and brother went to the store, and I stayed behind. I was listening to music and drawing with my window open, there was no window net. Next thing I know I'm sitting on the window ledge ready to jump. I was staring at the woods down the street from the house that I visited before and got a terrible feeling from. I immediately shut my window and curled into a ball trying to calm down. I didn't tell parents.

Another day I was again home alone, a few months later, reading. I looked up from my reading because I suddenly felt a strange presence. I heard someone turning a page in a book. I just closed my window and there was no breeze. I got up and wandered the house but no one was there.

There have been nights when I heard walking. I disregarded the footsteps thinking it my have been the neighbors.

The overall feeling of this house is that I'm being watched all the time. My brother and parents don't seem to feel anything. I spend the most time alone in the house, especially now that I finished High School. I often have to tell myself that I'm imagining everything just so I can fall asleep. I've stopped sleeping at night because I always feel like something is sitting at the foot of my bed and is going to grab me.

Just last year I came home from my ex-girlfriend's house and ran downstairs to grab something for her. My brother was heading upstairs. The moment we passed each other on the stairs I felt a hand shove me down. I fell down 7 stairs and injured my left arm and my head. I told them I was fine and when my parents got home I went to the hospital. By then I, thanks to the Ouija board, found out about 3 spirits dwelling in my house. 2 of then were angry but not necessarily violent.

1 of them I've known since I was 8. He was with me since I was born and normally protected me. He recently crossed over. Whether with him or without him one thing was for sure, my mood has warped since we moved into this house. I don't know if it's the area or the house but I've become totally depressed and always practically beg my friends to let me spend the night just so I can get out of this house.

I've heard whispers, seen flashes of light dart across my room at night, began choking for no reason, and other events which seem surreal. I often get terrified to walk around my house alone now. The weird thing is that all this seems to only happen to me. I know I'm not hallucinating seeing as I sometimes wake up with scratches on my face even though I bite my nails and can't scratch myself.

This house is only about 21 years old and the previous owners didn't die or anything. But I do remember, right after we bought the house, I overheard my neighbor telling my mom how the previous owners used to often fight and argue loudly, just like my family now. We didn't used to be like this. I don't know if it's psychological or supernatural. I want to hear your views or advice. Please, this house is really straining my nerves.

Hide And Seek A Ghost,Philippines,Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: Hide And Seek A Ghost

M y story started when I was between the ages of 4-5 years old. First off at that time I never really experienced any ghost encounters but have known about ghosts ever since then because of watching too much horror movies that involved ghosts. Plus, I usually overheard my Grandparents and/or parents talking about their ghost experiences which gave me chills when I was little. Oh and one last thing, I'm bad at grammar and stuff so please bear with me.

Anyway, it started when I woke up 7:00 in the morning. I did all my morning routines like eat, brush my teeth, etc. I went outside there after. As a kid I'm very outgoing, always looking for fun and I usually share that fun with my friend Reggie.

When I met up with him that morning we took a walk around the neighborhood. Then we saw this ""under construction house"". It's a house with gray bricks, metal rooftop, and it's only one story high. We planned to play hide and seek and decided who it is under a game of rock, paper, and scissors. Fortunately he was it so then he started to count and I ran inside. When I got in, there isn't much place to hide in because the only places I could hide were 2 rooms and a bathroom near the other exit of the building. So I decided to hide in the bathroom.

When I entered the room I saw this ""thing"" standing in the corner. Its body was somewhat dark as night, I saw its guts hanging on its stomach, and his face somewhat got squished by something because this thing was ugly. I look at it for only a few seconds and ran outside screaming because it intimidated me. Then when I got outside I saw my friend waiting for me and immediately said, ""you saw it too huh?"" I replied with a yes of course and asked him tons of questions about it. Then again all I got from him was that he doesn't know what it was. As we walk away from the property, frightened, we kept talking about what we saw until we got home and told our parents what we just saw.

One thing that bothers me from this experience was, why didn't I hear my friend screaming when he saw it too? Anyone help me about this? Thank you

The Abandoned School,"Texas, United States",Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: The Abandoned School

H ello again! Well I kind of feel guilty or weird or something because I have encountered so many strange things growing up. This story takes place in Dale Texas; it's about a 10 minute drive from Lytton Springs (where my last story took place).

Dale is an extremely small town. It consists of a locally owned gas station, a railroad track, and 2 roads that intersect right at the post office. That's it! Other than that it's a lot of land primarily used for livestock, some of it is heavily wooded and there are a lot of these DEEP ravines running through the woods. Oh I forgot to mention the old school that was converted into a town hall type of building.

This history of dale is pretty simple, it was where the black kids were sent to go to school back when everything was segregated. There are a lot of old abandoned buildings that are falling down, made entirely of wood and dirt floors, it's quite the depressing place.

My sister in laws dad had about 80 acres out there that he leased to cattle ranchers, and a small mobile home with a shed that was used to process meat (they were big on deer hunting) Well when my brother (who I lived with at the time) moved out of Lytton springs, his father in law said he could put a house on his land and we could live out there. Sweet deal! So I lived on this big chunk of land with not much to do but ride my 4 wheeler and go exploring in the woods and what not. We had 2 dogs, Chico and Annie, they would follow me everywhere.

One day while I was following the ravines deeper into the woods I came across a clearing. The trees in the woods were ancient, I'm talking over 100ft tall and had a diameter of 10-15feet, they were massive, and they groaned when the wind blew. I loved how big they were and I always thought of building the ultimate tree house in one someday. The only thing was they seemed to be rotting from the top down. Branches would fall all the time and the wood was very porous, not sturdy at all. Anyway, so I come to this clearing which seemed very out of place. There was a decent sized building slumped over in the center, with weeds and vines and tall grass all over. The Texas sun doesn't help plants thrive so almost all this brush was dead and dry and itched as I walked through it to check out the building. By the time I got to the building my socks were covered in dead seeds and grass etc... You know how it is.

The building was made of wood, the roof had collapsed and there were no doors. A small gravel path led off back into the woods, and there was a rusty sheet metal sign in the front that I couldn't read because it was so corroded. I was skeptical to go inside because it was falling apart and there were banana spiders everywhere (those big creepy yellow and black ones that make the zig zag pattern in their web). Then I thought to myself wow its not everyday you just find something like this in the middle of nowhere, so I carefully went inside. I was mostly walking on a powdery dirt floor and there were piles of wood in places where the roof had caved in. I was enjoying my little adventure until I heard the distinct sound of laughter.

Okay, who could that be? I knew there were no kids out here as I had to walk a good way to get to this place. I went back outside, into the hot sun and looked around... Nothing, no one at all. I shrugged it off and went back in.

My dogs wouldn't go in with me; they kept sniffing around the outside and peeing on everything. When you first go in there is a tall wooden counter near the wall with an old analog clock hanging on an old rusty nail covered in dust with a cracked face. I found some old papers that were so brittle if you touched them they would crumble into a dusty powder type substance. The papers were all so faded and must have been written in pencil or something because I couldn't read much other than a letter here and there. There was an old metal bell sitting on the counter, it still worked...sort of.

I continued through a door way into what I assume was a theater or something. There was a small elevated platform that looked like a stage; it had a poorly made podium and a lot of scattered chairs that were knocked over. It smelled really bad in this room, like an old library or something, it wasn't pleasant at all so I left and went to the room adjacent to the theater room. This is where it gets strange.

I heard the laughter again and a light banging noise. Ahh scared! I didn't know what to think so I just kept going, when I walked into this area, it appeared to be a class room. There was an old blackboard on the wall and a bunch of tiny wooden desks with scratches and stains on them.

All of a sudden I heard a light bang again and my dogs started to bark from outside. I could see slivers of sunlight coming in through the gaps in the wood of the wall. Then those gaps blacked out as if someone was walking by outside.

I said ""hello?"" loudly and asked if anyone was there. No response. I started to get a little creeped out now. When I looked away from the wall I noticed an eraser sitting on one of the desks. It wasn't there before... I turned around to leave and I heard the light bang again, I turned to look, the eraser was now on the ground under the chalk board!

Someone had just thrown the same eraser I was just looking at on the desk! Ok that's my queue to leave, I started heading for the way out again and that's when the banging started again repetitively. I heard the laughter again and as I looked back at the chalkboard, there were 3 or 4 erasers floating and being pounded on the chalkboard, like someone I couldn't see was holding them and playing around making chalk dust. At this point Id seen enough, I ran for the way out as the laughing and banging got louder.

My dogs were still barking with slight yelps at the end as if they were calling for me to get out of there. When I got to the lobby area the clock was spinning backwards! I saw the bright sun beaming through the door frame and headed for it, there was a loud scream and crying as I rushed out of the building into the brush. I didn't look back, my dogs ran to me and we all ran off into the woods and I followed the ravine back home.

I told my sister in law where I was and what I saw. She told me that it used to be a segregated school and was abandoned a long time ago. She told me her and her friends would go back there when they were kids and see who could stay in there the longest at night without getting scared.

I told her about the laughing and the chalk board and she confirmed that she had seen the same thing with the chalk board and erasers years ago. I decided it would be best to not go there again. I feel bad that there are kids still trapped in that horrible place, they seemed happy though. Any Ideas on why they are stuck in their old school? And what could that figure have been that I saw through the cracks in the wall?

Phantom Footsteps,"Montana, United States",Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: Phantom Footsteps

O n June 23, 2008 I was working at the entrance to the Nevada City Open Air Museum in Nevada City, Montana. I am a tour guide with the Montana Heritage Commission and was taking tickets and giving information that day for the museum.

It was around 5:30 in the afternoon and I was sitting in the booth reading a book. It was pretty slow, not too many people had come through, which is typical late in the day. As I was reading, I heard someone coming toward me on the boardwalk, from inside the museum.

I put my book down to greet them when they came out. No one appeared, so I leaned over the booth to see if I could see who was there, and I didn't see anyone. I was curious, so I got up and checked the first three buildings in the museum. I found no one, so I went back to the booth a little bit mystified. Just as I began reading again, the footsteps returned, and walked right past me in front of the booth I was sitting in.

The footsteps started at the entrance/exit of the museum and stopped right at the step going up into the Music Hall. There was no body associated with these steps, just disembodied footsteps. I was a bit spooked, but not scared, since I'd heard from our curator that the same incident happened to him a few years back, but only he had been followed by the footsteps, I only experienced them walking past me at the entrance to the museum.

Black Figure Sitting In The Room,Mexico,Apparitions / Voices / Touches,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Apparitions / Voices / Touches :: Black Figure Sitting In The Room

T his experience didn't happen to me, but it occurred while I was around. This happened probably around the mid 90's, my parents, me, and my brothers and sister went to Mexico to visit my father's parents. Note: this happened to my older brother.

It was a small town or village, in Mexico, I don't know, called Guanajuato or something pronounced that way. Well, my grandparents allowed us to sleep in my aunt's old bedroom while they slept in this tiny room in the porch.

My brother recalls, waking up in the middle of the night and there was a black figure sitting in this rocking chair. We slept on the bed together my brothers and me, and my brother told me that he was scared senseless. The black figure sat there, he described it, with hand on chin, just staring in to the darkness on my grandma's old rocking chair.

He then called out to the figure ""hey ""and it just turned to him quickly and all he could do was close his eyes and hope it would go away. He was seriously scared. Then he opened his eyes again and looked around the room and the figure was gone seconds after he witnessed it. Just gone. With no noise. No doors opening, no footsteps. It just vanished. He still gets chills whenever he speaks about it.

When I get the chance I talk to him about the black figure in the shadow sitting on my grandma's rocking chair, starring into the nothing, and ask him, maybe it was this, and maybe it was that? Grandma happened to walk in the room or grandpa was just checking on us maybe. He continues to deny it.

I still believe him, and I feel saddened for him experiencing that and all because everyone denies his belief, but me. He asked my grandma and grandpa, and my dad about it and I think they have yet to witness a figure sitting in the shadow. It still gives me creeps just thinking about it.

The Shadows Move,United Kingdom,Apparitions / Voices / Touches,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Apparitions / Voices / Touches :: The Shadows Move

T his is my first posting. My name is Louis, I am 19 and I live in England, in the south east of London, I won't specify too much.

I live in a new house, well we bought it when it was just land and watched it being built week by week, so I don't think there is nothing to associate with people dieing in the house, or in the area.

Some nights I would be just sitting in my living room, watching television, as most people my age do... I would see something move quickly in the corner of my eye, too large to be cat, and far too distinguished in shape to be the television casting shadows.

I see this often when down stairs alone, As if it waits for me to be vulnerable, they are always in the shape of what I would imagine a man in a cape and hood would look like but I only she his/hers/Its shadow, if you understand.

But it doesn't move like a human would, it glides, it looks like the shadow is traveling on 90 degree angle, leaning forward. Like on a cartoon when they would start running, Like Shaggy, from Scooby Doo for example.

I also get the chills and become cold, some nights I have heard breathing, that sounds like a man who has just ran a mile but trying not to sound tired, trying to sound silent but failing.

After seeing and hearing this I always retire to bed, sprinting up the stairs for dear live, I always have the feeling I'm being followed or watched when I climb my stairs. I don't know why, but I only feel it in my house.

When I get into bed I feel slightly more comfortable, at ease than anything, I do not know why, it like your bed is your sanctuary, nothing can harm you.

Spooky Situations in Local Sandwich Shop,United Kingdom,Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: Spooky Situations in Local Sandwich Shop

I recently started working in a new sandwich store, in a newly renovated building block in my town. The bottom of the block has been turned into shops, while the top has been turned into 'luxury' flats. We are on the end of the block, by the alley, and lately, a few of my co-workers and I have been noticing some odd occurrences.

I always work the 'close' shift, which is usually from about 4 or 5pm until 10:30 or 11pm. There are usually only two of us working on the 'close' and I've gotten to know the few people I close with pretty well in these past few months.

The back area of the store is quite small, and slightly claustrophobic. The back of the store is not visible from the front of the store, and even standing towards the middle of the store, you can't see to the back. There is a back door, which we've all noticed is either opened when no one has opened it, or closed, when someone opened it. Also, recently we've noticed that the door will now also lock/unlock itself.

One night while letting some dishes dry, we had a few containers stacked on top of each other, and while out in the main store, we heard a bang, so we went rushing to the back to find that the containers had fallen off the sink top (there is about a three inch lip on the edge of the sink to keep spillage to a minimum), and had separated- one container towards the back door, the other on the opposite side of the room.

Lately we've noticed a 'watched' feeling when we're back washing the dishes, and also when we are not even in the front of the store... No customers either, the sensor which tells us if there is a customer waiting, will go off a few times.

We've tested to see if possibly a fly or other small insect could set it off, but on throwing small items (like straws, stirrers, and straw wraps) past the sensor, it didn't go off.

Often times when we walk to the back, we'll hear a thud come from inside the fridge or freezer (both walk-in), but none of us have been brave enough to poke our heads in and see what's making the noise.

One of my co-workers and I named it Ben last night (because it's creepy in a passive-aggressive sort of way, like Ben Linus from Lost). We a not sure what could be causing all this. I know that the shop was another store before the building got renovated, but what it was before that I don't know. It's possible though that if it is something, that maybe it was not originally in our shop, but got 'disturbed' when the renovation took place and is now wandering around looking for mischief?

I don't know if it IS something or not, but I am convinced enough to have said goodnight to Ben as I left last night. I don't think he/she is harmful, maybe just bored.

No Open Curtains,United Kingdom,Orbs / Lights / Mists,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Orbs / Lights / Mists :: No Open Curtains

I had a friend come to visit about 4 weeks ago, and he stayed in a hotel in Kingsbury, North London. I live on the other side of London so I decided to stay with him, so I didn't have to take the long journey home on the tube late each night.

The room being in the attic was small with a double bed on high, because it was above the lift shaft, and you had to climb up a few stairs to get into bed, it was surrounded by a wooden barrier so you didn't fall out.

We had had a couple of drinks and were stayed up late catching up on gossip and old memories, it had been a lovely day outside (unusual for English weather) and being the attic, it was very hot.

It must have been around 2 in the morning, when my friend fell asleep due to all his travelling, I sat up watching telly for a little while, but decided to turn it off and go to bed myself.

I remember lying there, thinking I am never going to sleep as it was really so hot, too hot to get under the covers, so I decided to open the window a little further and move the curtains and net curtains out of the way so we can get some cold air straight through. I switched off the light and climbed up back on the bed and laid my head down to get some sleep.

Suddenly, I saw a light from the corner of my eye, and then without warning the curtains and nets closed-ON THEIR OWN! I kept seeing lights flying round the room, but I wasn't scared like I usually can be. I lay there watching them, and finally drifted off to sleep.

The next day I didn't mention anything about it to my friend, but the next night I made sure the curtains were kept closed.

The Mysterious Black Figure,"Colorado, United States",Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: The Mysterious Black Figure

I t was a hot, ninety-four degree day and I had to water the plants in the backyard. I dragged the hose over to the patch next to our neighbors' fence, and started spraying the plants. I adjusted the hose and accidentally, some water sprayed onto the fence. Just then, I saw a black figure move towards the left between the cracks of the fence. It looked like a dog, because the previous owners had one, so I knew what it looked like. The only problem was that the present owners didn't own one. I just ignored it because I guessed it was the grandpa living there.

Back inside, I took out a popsicle and started to just roam around in my own thoughts and rest for a bit. When I passed by the sliding door, I saw the black figure again on our neighbors' deck. I only saw this from the corner of my eye, and I knew it wasn't the grandpa I thought it was, because when I quickly looked back, it was gone. The figure was tall, and nothing over on their deck was even close to the figure's height. The figure showed that it wasn't a dog, it was a human figure, but I couldn't see anything else, except for its blackness.

A few years back, I remember reaching over for the soap in the bathroom at night. I woke up, with my hands feeling clammy. Just as I was reaching over to the other sink where the soap was, I looked at the mirror, and next to me, I saw a hooded figure, about a foot taller than I was. I couldn't see the face. It was just like an empty hole of blackness going forever. It didn't scare me too much, because I was younger and thought it was one of those ""dementors"" from the book series ""Harry Potter"", and I could use ""magic"" to ward it off. I'm wondering now, if it's the same figure that was in my neighbors' backyard.

Is this presense evil? (Although I don't get the evil feelings off of it.) Do you know if the presense is the same, and is it targeting me? (If it is, why?)

Theatre Spirit Activity,Australia,Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: Theatre Spirit Activity

M y old high school had a pack of ghosts. I'll tell you about my experience with one of them. I held off telling this one for good reason. The evidence is fairly flimsy and not the kind of thing I like to call proof but it's an interesting story so I hope you like it.

As I said our school was very old. It is the school which is in the famous Australian legend of Picnic at Hanging Rock which some people may know about. It has several known hauntings. Since I had only a single experience with one I might as well briefly tell you about the other ones; they're worth it, I think.

One was a White Lady who was known to be seen wandering on the croquet lawn late at night. The principal saw her several times and he was a credible man. Above the lawn is the Tower. The legend is that she was a school girl who cast herself to her death after being impregnated by the stable boy. I don't know if the story has any truth to it. Our soccer oval had the coach house on it originally. 3 graves were found there when the oval was being shaped. There have been reports of the sound of horses and voices down there at night.

My own experience was with the third. My drama teacher called her Penthesilea; a name coined from a line of Shakespeare's Twelfth Night in which Sir Toby Belch bids Penthesilea goodnight. Our drama teacher developed a ritual of saying good night to her. The drama office was in an annexe overlooking the theatre. It's less of a theatre, more of a hall set up for dramatic studies. The previous drama head working late would hear crying from the back stage area and investigate only to find nothing and the crying would cease until she left the area then it would continue. The current teacher, my teacher for 3 years only once saw her after making the mistake of turning off the lights from his office before getting to the outer door of the hall; something he never did for fear of seeing her. He didn't really like to talk about it. Now, onto my own experience.

We were putting on a play which required a large amount of weekend rehearsal for me because I had a main role. This would have been in 2004 and I would have been 17 going on 18. There were four of us in the building on a gloomy Saturday. It was cold; the school is on a mountain in the bush in an area which often gets snowed on in winter which is unusual for Australia. The character I played was one of three mains who occupied the stage area. One particular scene I was not in and since we were quite a way into the rehearsal process, I was occupying the area where I was supposed to be during the real show rather than sneaking off front stage for a coffee and a biscuit. The area was a small unlit costume room off side of the stage. It was used for storage of the usual junk which you would usually find floating around a theatre. I put a stool in there and sat waiting to come on. The other actors were blocking fairly vigorously and were taking a long time and I was sitting alone in the dark in the dingy costume room. I have to admit, I dozed off for a minute as the whole process was quite stressful and tiring. I think it was this relaxation on my part which drew her out.

I awoke sharply because the room had gotten overwhelmingly cold. As I previously mentioned it was a freezing day but inside it was temperate. In the tiny room I was sitting, the temperature plummeted. Immediately I felt really uneasy but didn't immediately think anything of it. Then all of a sudden I knew she was there. It was an unbelievably strange experience. I was definitely awake, facing the door and just felt her in the top right corner of the room behind me. I knew it was a female and I knew her presence was up in an unreachable area of the room but for some reason it felt so sensible for a moment or two before I was overwhelmed, jumped up and ran from the room without looking back. That was the first time I felt her presence in that room. During one of the actual performances of the show I felt like I wasn't alone back there.

I don't like to talk about ""feeling"" things. I'm not sensitive to anything especially not feelings. I have never felt anything like this before or since. I feel that the spirit was in fact merely curious. There was absolutely no hostility. I was hesitant about sharing the story because I didn't actually see anything with my eyes but at the same time I just knew she was there with me. The only real evidence I have was the overwhelming coldness which occurred suddenly and a cold spot is not exactly proof. There was enough evidence of experiences in the building to warrant me believing it without thinking that I'm crazy or that the whole thing was imaginary. It was the closest I have had to a conclusive experience so I wanted to share it. The place is a wonderful historical area and has many great stories associated with it so it felt appropriate to tell it.

What Came Out of my Son's Bedroom,"Texas, United States",Apparitions / Voices / Touches,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Apparitions / Voices / Touches :: What Came Out of my Son's Bedroom

F irst of all, I don't know how I got in here, I'm glad I join this group and read most of ya'll stories. I knew I fit in here.

Last week, one morning around 6 am, I got up and went to the kitchen to get a glass of water and I went back to bed, thinking if I should stay up and make some coffee while everyone's asleep.

I swear I saw a boy walking out of my boy's room, walking towards the hallway as a real person would be walking to the bathroom/kitchen. He was wearing blue shorts, a black shirt and had wavy brown hair.

For few minutes I was thinking ""Aw man, my stepson is awake"", so I got up and went check on my 6 year old. BOTH boys are asleep! No one has gotten up!

So I went to the living room searched around the house, checked the doors, but NOBODY was around. I swear I saw a guy walking out of my boy's room.

I got scared and ran and woke my husband up. We searched everywhere- the doors and all windows were locked!

Did I see a ghost? I was not dreaming. I was laying on my bed looking up the ceiling, staring down the hallway, and the boy's room. The shadow/ghost walked out as he did without seeing me!

From then on, I made sure to wake up when everyone else does, not on my own. It's hard to do so.

"Apparition in Buenavista, Colima",Mexico,Apparitions / Voices / Touches,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Apparitions / Voices / Touches :: Apparition in Buenavista, Colima

M y parents were born and raised in a small town called Buenavista, Colima. They got married and moved to the States. When I was about 16 years old I went to visit the town and stayed with my aunt.

On my first night there I had planned to unpack but didn't get to it as my aunt was going to give me a tour of the town. When we headed back home I went in the room to finish unpacking and to my surprise I found a pile of clothes in the center of the room. I told my aunt, she smiled and continued with her cleaning.

That night as I was lying in bed I heard my name coming from outside, I quickly got up and peaked through the window-no one was there but a dog. I stayed there looking outside and then I saw the curtain fly up. (There's an outdoor bathroom with a curtain as a door).

I figured it was the wind. The dog starts barking from afar but towards the bathroom. So I went outside towards the bathroom but before I even got near a girl run out, smiled and faded into a tree. I was in total shock

I ran to my aunt's bedroom and told her. The girl had no shoes and wore a raggedy dress, her hair was long but I didn't see her face. My aunt paused for a second and said that's your aunt Laura who drowned in the restroom 30+ years ago.

Yummy Monster,United Kingdom,Apparitions / Voices / Touches,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Apparitions / Voices / Touches :: Yummy Monster

Y ou'll probably find yourself giggling away at this story. I know I do whenever I think about it these days. But it terrified me when it originally happened!

I'm a bit hazy on how old I was at the time, but I think it was round about when I was 11-12.

It was a gorgeous day, so my friend and I decided that we were going to have a picnic. We grabbed some munchies and my dog at the time (Lucky) and headed to my local park, which was roughly no more than a five minute walk. Once there, we decided to go up to the top of the hill where there is a little ruin of a house (most likely the gardener's, as the park used to be fenced off, there was even a park warden! But that was all before I was even born).

The house was basically hidden away by young (thin) trees. It was a lovely shady spot so we didn't have to worry about the sun. Anyways, we're sitting munching away: god knows what Lucky was off doing, probably sniffing a tree. All was nice and peaceful when I hear ""yummy yummy yyyuuummmmyyy"" (no kidding) I looked at my friend, kind of shocked and she looked at me.

Finally one of us said ""did you hear that?"" first instinct: someone is hiding and pulling a prank. Well, one look around and you can see if anyone's there- we saw know one. It comes again ""yummmy yuuummy yuuuummmyy"" okay, I'm scared (always have been a big wimp) and we bolted leaving everything!

Now we're out on the top of the hill in the open, there is definitely no place to hide. It comes again. This time, only about a foot away from me! ""yuuummmy yummmy yuuuummmmmy"" Lucky starts going nuts! Seriously, she starts barking and snarling then she starts jumping up and down on the spot like she's trying to attack someone. That just freaked me out and I'm ashamed to say I bolted. I ran to the bottom of the hill to the actual park and dragged some poor man back up to the top of the hill so I could get the stuff back out. I can't remember what I told the guy, but he very nicely came back with me anyways.

My friend was a lot braver than me and had gone back in, gotten the stuff out and waited for me at the top of the hill-with my lovely dog!

I know it sounds pretty unbelievable, and if it wasn't for my dog attacking something invisible I'd have put it down to someone pulling a prank... Still I like telling the story every so often because it usually gets people giggling!

What's strange though is before that happened, I used to go up there by myself all the time, and nothing ever happened. I've only been back there once since it happened a few years back, but I was only brave enough to peak in-sadly, it was covered in beer tins.

My Ghostly Family,"Colorado, United States",Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: My Ghostly Family

I have never extensively shared my encounter stories outside my family and close circle of friends. Mostly because I find either people don't believe or think I am just making up a great story. After reading people's experiences on this site I think most people are open to the idea that these events really do happen. I beg the readers pardon if this story is too long but I have many years and events to describe in one post. First off the time period is between 1998 and present. All the encounters happen in my family's home in Colorado. It is a ranch style house (for those who are not familiar it's a long open house with a first floor and a basement.) Most the activity centers around the north corner of the house (guest bedroom) or my bedroom in the basement (under the guest bedroom).

I want to start out by telling all the readers that I am putting in all the events that I can not logically explain. I am sure that a few books fell off their shelf by mere accident and not by the presence of a spirit but these events that I am going to share I can not make any reason out of them besides that of several spirits who reside in my home. Enough with the boring details now on with the story.

The first event takes place when I was in 8th grade. I was walking up my driveway looking at the mail that I had just collected when I heard my front door slam. I looked up to see a shadow move across our front door window. Being a fair distance from the door I thought nothing of it. My mother was usually home when I arrived home and I thought it was just her. When I reached the door I found it locked. ""Ha, ha"" I thought to myself ""very funny-locking me out"". I expected my mother to jump out and scare me as I unlocked the door, but no one was in the front room. I called out to her saying she wasn't funny but no one answered. So I went back to her bedroom and then to her study but no one was home. I immediately grabbed a knife thinking that someone had broken in and was still in the house with me. After an extensive search of the house no one was there but me. At the time I chalked it up to my mind playing tricks on me but as time went on the ghost encounters became more aggressive.

Some time after 8th grade my parents remodelled our basement so my brother and I could have our own rooms down there. They knocked out most of the wall creating two large common rooms and two bedrooms for us. Once it was done my mother showed it off to all her friends, so I was used to coming home to people in the house. One day after school I came home and announcing my return. Stopping to hear if anyone had called back I heard two ladies talking in the basement. I ran down the stairs thinking my mother was on another one of her ""tours"". The ladies were talking in my bedroom so I rushed down the stairs and to my room. When I entered my blood ran cold, no one was there. But until the moment I came in I heard voices. Feeling very unnerved I left.

Feeling very uneasy with this situation I began to put a mask collection on my wall. I was always told that some cultures used masks to keep spirits at bay. In total I put about 14 masks above my bed, it might have been a little drastic but I was scared. For a while nothing happened but one afternoon I was left a message that I had crossed a line. I came into my room to find that all but 3 masks had been ripped off the wall and thrown to the other side, one mask broken in two. My fist inclination was to blame my younger brother, but he had been at school with me all day. I then asked my mother if she had taken my masks down but she said she was out of the house. Needless to say I took the hint, packed all but the three masks away and apologized to empty space hoping to make peace.

About a year and a half went by without any large activity, there were the occasional creaks in the night but nothing more of the two ladies. At this point in the story I must tell everyone that the rest of the encounters all happened between the hours of 2:00am and 3:00am (always). I have not figured out why this time of the day and not others. So at this point in life I had become at ease with the possibility that there were two ghosts in the house. I was to find out that there were a few more guests in the house that I had yet to meet.

One night I had fallen asleep on the family room couch upstairs with my dog. Around 2:00 am I heard the sounds of footsteps in the back where the guest bedroom was. I woke up heart pounding. Two beats went by and then all of a sudden the footsteps turned into a full blow run; something was running through the house right at me. I could hear it getting louder and I could see the glass cabinets shaking in the moon light. I know that I am not dreaming because my dog bolted off the couch and ran toward the sound. Once the sound reached the couch I heard the sound of sneakers on a gym floor, that high pitch skid and then silence. My breath escaped through my throat, I can see nothing in the room with me. I slowly get up and make my way to a light switch and spend the rest of the night in a restless sleep.

It was at this point that I confided in my mother- my father doesn't believe that ghosts exist. She hadn't heard the sound but she had said she noticed that the closet doors in the guest bedroom would always be open in the morning and she would always close them only to find them reopened later in the day. Knowing that we were at school she just thought it strange but with my story she felt that there was something in the house.

Feeling that someone believed me I set off to try and make contact with any of the ghosts. Either the two ladies or the newest ghost who I felt was a little boy (don't ask me why I felt it was a little boy it just sounded like a little boy running through the house.) I started out very simple, leaving a pen and paper out hoping they would leave a note. As I researched more I found that people could catch sounds on recorders so I set some up some in my room, nothing happened. There was no pattern to the events and it seemed that every time I tried to get ""hard evidence"" they become more reclusive. So I gave up trying and once again things started to get weird.

Now I was a junior in high school and was soon to have the most events happen to me sequentially than ever before. It started out as a small event and worked itself up to much greater encounter. One night I was awoken to the smallest sound. The best way I can describe it is when you turn your radio on to the lowest setting before you can not hear it any more. You can hear the sounds but you can not make out the words. Being groggy I hit my radio alarm clock several times; when the sound did not stop I unplugged the whole clock. Settling back into bed I could still hear the sound. I turned on my light trying to find the source of the sound. After some searching with my ear I found the source of the sound to be coming from a tiny little soap stone figure I had on my bedside table. I thought I must be going mad, so I moved it to the base of my window. The sound moved with the figure. Sitting there I had no idea what to make of this situation, I could not make out any words that were coming from this little statue but I could tell it was a man's voice. Feeling that this was not the weirdest thing that has ever happened in the house, and knowing I had to get up in 4 hours for school; I moved it to the far end of my room and went to sleep.

It was from this point that I met the fourth ghost, that of a teenage girl. This spirit never showed itself nor did she make any of the loud movements of the other house guests. I can only say I knew she was there and I felt her very close at times. It was not a hostile feeling but one of curiosity. There were times I knew she was in my room and as I began to drift to sleep I felt a finger touch my cheek. Even though I was scared to death from this I never woke up nor made any sudden movements. I began to feel more sever cold spots in the house. Most the time I thought it was just a draft but on many occasion I began to shiver and feel cold while taking a hot shower and no amount of warmth could make it go away.

I desperately wanted to see one of the ghost guests and would ask them always very politely if they would show themselves to me, never to any avail. But one night I saw something that I can not fully explain. I had just locked up the house for the night and was walking downstairs (in the dark) I saw two orbs shoot over the banister (one was a copperish light- the other silvery white). I stopped to see if a car had come up the street and made a reflection off some light but there was no one outside. It could have been a trick of light but I felt that I had my first glimpse at a real ghost. Unfortunately it is from here that events started to become frightening, almost to the point where I wouldn't sleep in my bedroom.

I had now gone off to college and was only home on the holiday breaks. I still knew that I had my ghosts at home (and one ghost at college, story for another day) and had returned home several times to no events. In some way I felt that they were upset that I had left and they wanted nothing more to do with me, this was not the case. One night freshmen year (first year of college) I woke up in a complete panic, I couldn't move! Worse yet I couldn't breathe and I felt as though someone was choking me. I can not say with certainty if I saw a dark shadow over me or if it was my eye adjusting to the dark of my room but I did know that I was running out of air. Just before the point of pure panic it stopped, I gasped for air and ran to my bathroom for some water. While looking at myself in the mirror I could see the faint lines a finger makes disappearing around me neck. Now I will buy the argument that I was having a nightmare about someone choking me and in a fit to stop this actually started to choke myself, but I felt that I was awake for most of this event. Feeling threatened by the situation I moved myself upstairs to the couch for the rest of my break.

This did not stop anything from happening; I could still hear things moving in the night, always off on the periphery of my hearing. One night I told myself that I was being silly and that I should move back down to my room. I got my bedding material, walked over to the downstairs and flicked the light off. The moment I turned around a white hand shot through the darkness right at my face. Up until that moment I had never had an urge to scream but I nearly did at that moment. Instinct took over my brain and I flicked the light on faster than I knew I could only to reveal an empty stairwell. I felt that I was being ""ganged up on"" but in retrospect I think I was being warned by the young girl not to go back downstairs.

Years later my younger brother would tell me that he too heard weird things while I slept upstairs. He heard a man yelling at someone and loud thuds in my room. My only theory is maybe an angry spirit had passed through the house and the permanent residents didn't like his presence. I will never know.

The last two major events happened my last year in college and were the most frightening events that have ever happened in my life. I had returned home for my long winter break and, in traditional fashion, dumped everything I had in my suitcase on my floor (every room should be a little cluttered). My floor was covered in all the graded papers that I had shoved in my back pack in my hurried attempt to get out of school. That night as I began to doze I heard the sound of someone stepping on a page, and then again. Slowly the sound of crinkling pages began to make its way to my bed. I held my breath hoping it would stop but the steps grew ever so close. Bearing it no longer I switched my lamp and relocated myself back upstairs. Feeling frustrated that I couldn't stay in my room I was determined that nothing was going to move me, or so I thought. We all have moments in our lives that affect us so greatly that we can still feel the emotions we felt the moment the event took place, this is one of mine.

My clock read 2:10 am; I know this because it was the first thing I saw when I was woken up by the sound of two ladies talking. It had been eight years since I heard them but now I was sure that there were two people talking in my room. Groggy and not knowing what was going I sat up in bed and asked who was there. The conversation stopped at once. Becoming more alert I started to ask again. I had just started to form the word when the loudest scream erupted from the foot of my bed. It was so loud and so shrill, I have never to this day heard such a scream and I hope to never again. But here it was at the foot of my bed and rushing towards me at an unimaginable speed. I grasped my lamp and flung the light on in a fit of panic. I couldn't stop my body from shaking, my eyes were welling up with tears and I could feel the adrenaline surging through my body. I couldn't let go of my lamp, I was too terrified to let go of that light. I don't know how long I stayed that way; eyes darting, looking for some form to emerge from the shadows to makes that final blow. But nothing ever came, nothing made a sound and I didn't sleep for two days.

No one else in the house heard the scream, not that it surprised me. Most of my family could sleep through a freight train rolling through the living room. But I never let on how much this event marked me. To this day I do not sleep in that room without some form of light on. I know it may seem childish but I feel that there is something in the dark now.

Nothing major has happened since then. I am well out of college and have brought my future wife home for the holidays. She knows the stories I have told her but she has never seen anything weird happen. When we come home we sleep in the guest bedroom. Sometime late at night I hear closet doors rattle and crack open ever so slightly. My fiance also heard the doors shaking and though it freaked her out it didn't scare her away. I feel that my connection with my house guests have become strained over the years. I can not feel them as strongly as I used to but in some ways it might be for the best. Maybe as time goes on I will have more stories to tell you of my four guests who have never left. I know this has been a very long story and I want thank all those who have read it to the end. It is good to know that other people have had experiences like mine and that I can read them and relate. I am also very glad that I am finally able to share this story after all these years.

Numerous Things,"Indiana, United States",Apparitions / Voices / Touches,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Apparitions / Voices / Touches :: Numerous Things

W ell I live in this house that is over 110 years old. Numerous things have happened in this house that we can't explain. For my birthday I had a couple of my friends stay the night and in the middle of the night we kept hearing the radio turn on and off in the basement, but when we went upstairs earlier that night we had unplugged the radio. We all had started freaking out and my cousin and I went down later on that night after it had stopped and it was unplugged.

We have a piano down in the foyer of our house and every time we play it we hear kids screaming and people talking, we know that it is no one else in the house because I had told my mom about it and she didn't believe me so we all stood in there and while I played the piano you could hear people.

Just the other night I had my friend Jessica stay the night and we were laying on my bed and we both heard a noise out in the hallway so we looked and we saw a black figure walking into my parents' room and we know it wasn't my brother or sister because they weren't even in my parents' room-they were downstairs. When we were about to go to sleep we kept hearing people walking in my room and my door handle kept shaking- we even got that on video.

So many other things have happened in my house, but there are too many to put on here. If you would like to know any others just ask and I'll tell you.

Message From A Loving Auntie?,Canada,Family / Friends Visits,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Family / Friends Visits :: Message From A Loving Auntie?

I t has been about thirteen years since my Aunt Eileen passed on. Needless to say, I think about and miss her everyday. One of her biggest regrets was that she wasn't going to see me grow up; it's so heart breaking.

In December, my school held a Winter Formal before the Winter Holidays began. This was a pretty big deal for my school because it was like a winter prom; everyone dressed up and all of that ""good"" stuff. That evening when I was getting ready, all I could think about was my Aunt and how she would've been helping me get ready instead of my brother who was getting ready himself. My date arrived a little early; this made the thoughts about my Aunt even stronger and even started to make me a little depressed thinking about how she wasn't there to meet my date.

As all these sad thoughts ran through my head, the phone rang. I answered and what the lady at the other end said kind of made me wonder. She said, ""Is this the Garrick residence? I was told by a lady named Eileen to phone here..."" I was shocked! How coincidental was that?! I told the lady that we don't know anyone by the name of Eileen here (no one in this world anyway) but she kept on insisting. I told her that if this Eileen person called again to tell her to just call here herself. Boy did I set myself up.

I hung up the phone and put the finishing touches on my hair. We were about to head out when the phone rang again. I was tempted to just let it ring and leave, but something told me to answer. I picked the phone a little reluctantly and said ""hello"". It was very static-y and almost inaudible. I grew somewhat frustrated and again said hello. After the second hello, I heard it, a voice. It was faint, ""Hey! Have fun! Love you!"" then the line went dead. I was so shocked! I hung up the phone and grabbed my brother and date and dashed out of there.

That night I had a lot of fun. It was one of the best Winter Formals I went to. I'm thinking it was my Aunt that wanted to make contact with me to cheer me up.

The Blob In The Apartment,Australia,Orbs / Lights / Mists,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Orbs / Lights / Mists :: The Blob In The Apartment

I spent yesterday night (25.06.08) at my friend's sister's apartment cause he has ""Super Smash Bros. Brawl - Wii"". When we arrived at Elle's (not her name) she told me that I may see something but not to be scared. I looked at her like ""what the heck is she talking about?""

So as we were walking up to her apartment room, I was whispering to my friend asking ""what did your sister mean? Is this place haunted?""

My friend, without any emotion, no fear like the haunting was absolutely nothing, answered with a plain ""Yep"".

My reaction was fear at first obviously and replied with an ""oh...""

Well I was feeling terrified cause this was going to be the first time I've ever come in contact with a spirit close up. I didn't know what to do if I were to wake up in the middle of the night to see a face in front of me.

We went into the apartment and the first thing everyone did was get changed. I however was alone in the living room and kept turning around, thinking to myself, ""oh my god, how long does it take to get changed?"" since I was feeling scared.

Anyways, Elle came out and asked what I would like for dinner, I didn't mind, I told her it was up to her. She insisted on me to pick tonight's menu as I was the guest (I sort of have a crush on her, she's pretty hot!) so blushing, I said in a soft voice ""err... how about pasta?"" (I couldn't think of any other food) She agreed and asked what type? I said ""Carbonara"" (yummy).

So I went to the living room which was just right in front of the kitchen and was conversing with her while she was cooking and while I was watching ""big brother"". It was around 7:25pm when we heard a thump (If you guys were wondering where my friend is he's in the shower). Of course my body went stiff and I looked around, ""It's heeeere!"" Elle said in an eerie voice. I jumped up and ran to the kitchen looking around the living room area.""Everywhere?"" I said quivering next to her.

She laughed and said ""well it's not just going to show itself, it'll show when you least expect it"". Well after hearing that I decided that I wanted to go home. She told me the ghost is harmless and it's not going to frighten you and to trust her.

So after this, my friend came out of the shower and said ""did you see it?"" I said ""no"". Dinner was finally cooked and we were sitting on the couch watching ""Rules of engagement"". We heard another bang and the water turning on in the bathroom, I jumped up off the couch and looked around, they both started laughing. I figured that this was a prank of some sort and laughed as well.

Elle went to the bathroom, and Daniel and I were still eating. I asked if the apartment was really haunted and he said yes. Elle came back and the lights started to flicker, I got so scared and went closer to Elle and that's when I saw it. It's wasn't in a human form or anything... just a blob. All it was doing was going from corner to corner on the ceiling. It seemed like every time it tried to come down, it went back up.

Elle said that it always does this and nothing else. It's the same pattern over and over again. I got out my phone to take a picture of it. Every time I took a picture it would be on the other corner, I could never get a shot of it. It started moving faster and Elle said that it's never done this before and to put the phone away.

Then, the lamp bulb exploded and all of us screamed. Elle quickly went to get some incense and lit the room, apologising to the spirit on my behalf. It slowed down and disappeared.

Everything was quiet and the TV was off (we didn't even turn it off)-we turned it back on and I was sitting there shocked.I said that I wanted to go home cause I knew I pissed it off and I didn't want to spend the night thinking what it will do to me while I was sleeping.

Three Strange Ghost Dreams,"California, United States",Misc,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Misc :: Three Strange Ghost Dreams

O ne night when I went to sleep, I had a dream that I was in a house with my friend. It was her house only slightly different. When we were in the basement, we saw a white figure that looked like a figure some of my friends and I saw before in real life. She said ""follow me"" 5 times, then took off at high speed going through many walls and stopped before she reached the door. I was able to follow her but my friend was left behind. The strange figure went through the door, I was still running after Her not knowing that she would come back through the door, opened it so I would run outside and then locked it, so I would not be able to go back in to save my friend. Then I woke up relieved to know it was dream.

A couple nights later I had a similar dream. Only I was with more people in a different house. We were trying to find the same ghost because the owner said she always had the same problem. I woke up in the middle of the dream. I was even more freaked out when I woke up. I did not tell anyone about my strange connected dreams. Until the last night I had a dream related to the other 2 I had in the past.

Me and me friend saw a group of kids about to go into the house. We quickly ran over to them to warn them about the ""mysterious"" happenings. They all followed me to my house which was 2 doors down and my friend and I explained what happened the past few days. They all believed me and my friend except for one of them. He looked like my friend's cousin. He went out the door and suddenly vanished. About 5 minutes later the door opened on its own. There he was, staring with his eyes open so wide He did not blink. He said something I could not catch, but I knew it was a clue about why I was having these strange dreams.

One of my friend's friend said she had the same dream I had before the 2nd dream. I knew right away that it was no joke. She was real-she was trying to give me a sign.

More Experiences in the House,Canada,Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: More Experiences in the House

I 've submitted 2 stories of things that had taken place in a house I grew up in. Both stories had witnesses but this is one where I was all alone.

On the weekends my Mother would get up early and go to the Farmer's Market and let my sisters and I sleep in. At this time my eldest sister was a raging teenager who was always out late and sleeping in even later. My middle sister had a number of personal issues with my Mum, as teenage girls tend to do, and at this time was living with my Father.

This particular time I was 10 or 11 years old and was up on a Saturday morning taking a bath. I knew my Mum had gone to the Farmer's Market and would be back soon so I was amusing myself until she returned.

Directly on the other side of the bathtub wall was the kitchen. I heard my eldest sister moving plates and cutlery. I assumed she was making herself a late breakfast and called out to her to make me something also. She didn't answer, but continued to get things out of the cupboards and drawers. I continued to yell at her, getting louder in the event that she didn't hear me as well as knocking on the wall. I suspected that she was purposely ignoring me so as not to have to make me anything.

I was beyond miffed at this and having a pretty healthy sense of childish entitlement I marched out of the bathroom wrapped in a towel, dripping wet into the kitchen to tell her what I thought of her ignoring me. To my surprise she wasn't there and nothing had been moved or misplaced. I was shocked. I went downstairs to her room only to find it empty and quiet. She wasn't home and hadn't been all night. It wasn't unusual for her to stay over at a friend's.

It dawned on me that I was all alone. No one was there and yet I had distinctly heard dishes and cutlery, doors and drawers being moved in the kitchen.

When I think about it now, I can't really remember what I did next. I imagine I high-tailed it out of the basement and suspect I probably went over to a neighborhood friend's until my Mum returned.

Thinking about this some 20 odd years later I still cannot come up with an explanation of what happened other than it was the spirit that lived in our house trying to let me know they were there.

Sally Mae Hatfield,"Ohio, United States",Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: Sally Mae Hatfield

I got a phone call this morning from Stan (the security guard in my last post). He told me that after the incident with our nurse-ghost that he was too freaked out to stay on nights, and that he had switched to a first shift position. I was wondering why I'd not seen him over the past few months. He proceeded to tell me about the memorabilia that was put up in our hall ways last week to celebrate the hospitals 100 year anniversary. Administration put up pictures of the opening of the hospital, as well as pictures of the nursing and physician staff from when the hospital opened to present time.

He said that there's a black and white photo of a 1910 graduating nursing class that has each graduates name printed underneath of them. He went on to say that as soon as he saw the photo that one of the faces practically jumped out at him, and that right away he knew it was the nurse that walked with me that night. ""Sally Mae Hatfield"" he said. I repeated the name to make sure I heard him correctly. He assured me that was the name, and that it was definitely her. He said he just wanted to let me know and that I should check it out when I come back to work.

Well I worked last night, and today started my 4 days off. But I was so curious to see her face I went back in and checked the picture out for myself. After I found the photograph and picked out which lady she was, I got goose bumps over my whole body. I suddenly felt almost nauseous. I'm not really sure why my body started to act this way, but the feeling faded quickly. I stared studying the structure of her face she was a beautiful woman she looked very young in the photo, maybe in her mid 20's if that. She had long dark hair, and her cheek bones stood out as they seemed to be her main facial feature.

After standing in front of this picture for what seemed to be an hour or more (but truly was only like 20 minutes) I felt the need to know everything about her.

I went over to HR to see if there was any way to get information about the nurse that worked there so many years ago. I was told that even if there was a way to find any records on her that it would be against HIPPA regulations to give out any info they might have and that with her being there so long ago that any paper trail would have been long gone to another place where they store all the old records. So I felt hopeless. I grabbed a coffee, and went back to the photos.

As I walked back over to the photo there was an older couple standing in front of it. I overheard the woman say to what appeared to be her husband ""and this is my mother's youngest sister, Aunt Sally"" and she pointed to Sally Mae's picture. My jaw just about dropped to the floor. I was almost in shock.

Right then I interrupted them and asked her about her aunt's career there at the hospital. She pointed to another woman (Janie Rhodes). She said this is her mother. She told me that they both worked there for more then 20 years, and that she too had been employed by the hospital many years ago. She said her aunt and her mom both graduated in that class, that they both worked separate shifts in the ER. Janie worked days, as she had to be home for her children and husband when school got out, and Sally Mae worked nights. Sally hadn't married nor did she bare any children due to the fact that she was so wrapped up in her career. We walked over to the small cafe I bought them both coffees and we talked for about 2 hours. She never once asked why I was so interested in her aunt, and I wasn't comfortable to just tell her why I wanted to know so much.

Well she said that her mother had passed away at a local nursing home in 1980, and that Sally Mae didn't live quite as long. She said when Sally was 37 she was working an 8 hour shift in the ER and she was treating a young male patient that had been beaten pretty badly in a fight, and 2 men came in asking to see him saying they were family, and they were let in.

Sally was in a room with another patient when she heard the boy arguing with his guests. She walked into the room and one of the men had a knife and was actually stabbing the young boy. She ran over screaming for help and the man began stabbing her. The two guys ran off and were captured less then an hour later.

Sally Mae had 5 stab wounds and was treated at the hospital. She was doing well healing up good when she encountered a staph infection that went on to take her life after 4 weeks of treatment. The young boy was treated and left the hospital a week later with no problems.

This whole thing has blown me away. I can't get this conversation out of my head. I came right home and jumped on here to tell you all that were so interested in my previous posting.

She's Come Home,"North Carolina, United States",Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: She's Come Home

T his sighting happened in Charlotte, NC on Ellington St. in an old duplex that my some friends rented. It wasn't on the best side of the town, but it was safe and everyone within range knew each other and took care of one another. The place wasn't much to look at.

At the last minute, my ex and I were asked to house sit. We didn't mind because we'd have the place to ourselves and we were very comfortable being there, so we agreed.

We arrived later in the evening, enough time to just get ready for bed. I had just finished taking a shower and came into the room that we were going to spend the night in. It was around 11pm or closer to 12am, and it was no longer than 20 minutes from the time that I came into the room to situate myself that we heard the window open from the other bedroom. This was a duplex, a small one at that if you could imagine a big square box with 4 little boxes inside as the bedrooms, living room and kitchen and a small little bathroom that split between the 4 boxed rooms. The bedrooms shared a wall and the windows were adjacent to one another. What we heard what quite clear, loud and obvious-the window was shut.

Did someone just break in? We're we being robbed? We stood still in place and waited to see what would happen. If we could hear them, they sure can heck hear us. I muffled the words, ""go get something"". I wanted to prepare ourselves with what and who we had to face and I didn't want to be empty handed.

Because I had just come into to the room after the shower, I hadn't had the chance to close the door behind. I panicked even more so because now they could see us! They couldn't possibly think the place was unoccupied. Our car is outside plus, we had the lights on. Who ever it was had the upper hand. They knew what they were getting themselves into.

We heard walking, the floor creaking and the sound of a pants dragging on the floor. Since we were on the bad side of town, we assume naturally. Maybe a homeless guy who needed a place to stay, or someone running and broke in to get away.

I than started to move to reach for another object and moved closer to the door because I want to be there and not for them to be in here, cornering us in a small bedroom. My ex then quickly blocked my way and told me to stay behind. I was scared either way, for him, for me! The walking stopped. We stood still, waiting. He, my ex, decided to walk outside of the room to let our presence be known, not that it wasn't already obvious. He stayed within sight of me. He came back in to report that there was nothing and no one was out there.

We were confused, scared, and worried. We didn't know how to react now. We started to whisper our thoughts. And we heard the movement starting to back up! Oh my god! I was now near hysterical because he didn't close the door behind him and the door is opened even wider. We both just stared towards the door and there it was or there she was. She couldn't have been more than 10 years old. She was blonde, average height and wearing an all white nightgown that dragged on the floor. She walked right by the room and didn't think twice to look our way.

My ex gathered his thoughts and again told me to wait to see where she goes in the apartment. Maybe she would just leave through the front door. A moment of scare was gone and now we were concerned for this girl. Why is she alone? When we didn't hear the front door open or shut, I made him go follow her to see if she needed help or something. Of course, he hesitated, but he went and came back within a minute to say she was gone. Nothing! No evidence of the door or the back door, or even the kitchen window looked like it was tampered with.

We turned on all the lights by this point and traced every step. We went into the other bedroom and checked it out. The windows were sealed shut and locked. No evidence of robbery or anything out of place.

Needless to say, we fell asleep with all the lights on. We woke up around 6am. We couldn't sleep.

We tried to ration everything. We even talked to the adjoining neighbors and they claim they weren't even home and only just got home. When our friends came back that afternoon, we dare ask them and maybe they could make some sense it what happened to us the night before. The reaction we got was, ""oh yeah, she's always here. She doesn't bother us. She keeps to herself. She'll just walk past us and keep on"". ""What? (You can only imagine what our thoughts were at this point). Are you nuts?! You guys have been living with a little girl ghost and that's it?!""

All in all, this experience that we had may have only been 30 minutes long, but it seem like an eternity when it was happening.

My ex and I have parted since, and I haven't gone back, since it was his friends' place. I've also moved to Smyrna, GA, close to Marietta, another ghost hot spot. I do hope to go back there someday to investigate, but I know other people are living there now.

A Ghost In The Stockroom,Puerto Rico,Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: A Ghost In The Stockroom

H ello, my name is Gladys. I am a recently retired worker in a large retail store. My story happened in that store. Back in the morning of Sept. 6, 1999 I went to take my break in the stores own cafeteria, the person who attended me was a really nice man named Bobby, a man everyone liked and respected as a co-worker.

I paid bobby with a five dollar bill and he gave me change for a $20. I pointed out the mistake and we both laughed as he said ""Do you see what happens when you drink to much? 20 minutes later I heard a desperate page from the garden shop to management to immediately come. Bobby killed himself! Due to marriage problems bobby was gone.

About a month later strange things started happening. Here's one example: The store had a night stocking crew and a new worker had followed a man from the cafe stockroom out onto the sales floor telling the ""man"" the store was closed. The man turned and said he worked there only to disappear in front of his eyes! Needless to say the stock man quit the next morning. He was at the front door first to leave!

There has been more sightings of bobby, mostly in the night. No one is frightened due to how much of a nice man and co-worker bobby really was. This is my true ghost story.

I choose that room because of that tree because I like the smell of the green leaves and hearing singing birds in the morning.

One night it all changed into something I never anticipated. I was preparing myself to sleep when I have this thought of closing the window that night. I always want the window open because I like the cold fresh air but since I'm already enjoying the comfort of my bed I just ignored the feeling and closed my eyes. A few minutes later as I was just starting to fall asleep I heard a weird voice, it is like someone clearing its throat, and it was very lucid and eerie.

I was alarmed, asked myself ""What is that? A dog? There's no dog in this compound (not allowed) and the voice was too big for a dog, a horse? Who will bring a horse to an apartment? It's not possible, oh maybe something from the neighbor? Then what kind of sound would it be?""... Don't know what to think. It woke my veins and blood up so I listened very carefully if I will hear it again. Then there it goes, it's like a short deep hum of an old big person this time, (I can't really explain the exact sound of it) but still deep voice of something really big. I'm all alone in my room and I was stunned.

I still try to make a sense out of it, thinking oh maybe it is just something. But the third time was more terrifying for it became louder and closer to my window. My bed was located at the middle of the window where I can easily peep at that big tree and moon whenever I like... It's a bad idea after all. Too terrified to glance at whatever it is so I just cover myself with my blanket frozen until I fall asleep.

The next morning I told my sister and friends (close neighbors) about it because I want to know if they also heard something like that. They all said it's the ""Kapre"" who lives in that big tree. There was a time Ryl my friend, was at the laundry room when she smell a tobacco smoke coming from that tree. The laundry room was an open area at the back of every apartment where the tenant could place and dry their clothes from direct sunlight it doesn't have elevated walls so you could easily see the tree. She thought who would light dead grasses in this time of night? She immediately left the room when she remembers the big tree.

Since then I keep my windows closed before it gets dark... A few months later the big old tree was cut down. I don't know if I will believe about Kapre but the voice really scared my whole being.

Kapre is a creature that could be characterized as a tree demon, but with more human characteristics. It is described as being a tall (7 to 9 ft), brown, hairy male with a beard. Kapres are normally described as smoking a big tobacco pipe, whose strong smell would attract human attention. (From Wikipedia)

First Encounter With A Demon?,"Florida, United States",Demons / Possessions / Exorcisms,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Demons / Possessions / Exorcisms :: First Encounter With A Demon?

T he year was 1999 it was late in July, my best friend invited me to go jet skiing in the Atlantic with his family. As always I accepted his invitation and drove over to his house to stay the night. I arrived after they had eaten dinner and everyone was just sitting around the table planning for the trip in the morning. I took up a chair and just listened in on what the plans were.

My friend's dad went to bed and his mother and he had decided that they should inform me of what had been happening in their house within the past week or so. She started of with a simple yet at the time a silly question, ""Do you believe in Ghost's?"" I said no and looked at my friend to see were the punch line came in. She then said that her daughter (who is the same age as I) had always had trouble with this ghost, but it had recently decided to start bothering the rest of the house hold. She continued to speak and at times I found it hard to keep listening but I grudged through.

They have only two children my friend and his younger sister; they also had a Great Dane named Jayda. About this time my friend's sister came in from wherever she had been and joined in the conversation they were forcing me to have about this ghost. She stated that it always moved things in her room and sometimes just thrashed the place. This would be a good excuse for a teenage girl to have but not for her she is excessive compulsive which translates to ""neat freak"". She went on and said she could ignore it for only so long before she asked my friend to bless the room. At this time he was very pious and believed it was a demon and that he could cast it out because he was a Christian.

Two nights went by and the ghost had apparently moved on. Until that following weekend it was like a breath of fresh air in the house (I'm quoting this). His sister came home one afternoon after cheerleader practice and went to wash up in the bathroom her and her brother shared. She took a shower and went to get a towel out of the linen closet located in the bathroom. She opened the sliding mirrored door, crouched on the floor was a sickly looking old lady looking up at her. She freaked out ran naked through the house to find her brother. This is when I found out that she was staying at a friend's house and only came home to shower and get clean clothes.

Now I was very skeptical still at this point, so my friend told me of his encounter with it. He stated, ""I thought I scared it off but it only seems like I pissed it off and now it is in my room too..."" He followed it up by saying, ""It scratches the wall and ceiling and pulled my covers off of me in the middle of the night..."" I was trying to be nice but I couldn't help but throw in a couple of ""jabs"" at them because it all seemed very far fetched to me.So they finally gave up with me but told me to be careful and not provoke it.

I went into my friend's room to make a bed on the floor while they still sat around in the living room talking about the ghost I suppose. In his room are a walk-in closet with only one door in and no vents. I went in and got covers, a pillow and an old military bed roll then set up a sleeping area. I noticed a weird looking oriental lamp in the room that was on but not throwing off much light. I went back out of the room and asked about the lamp. My friend stated, ""It doesn't like the light so I leave it on so I can get some sleep..."" Now I really had to poke fun at him for having a ""night light"". I told him that I better not wake up and see him sucking on his thumb, or he'd never hear the end of it.

We finally made our way to the room to go to sleep, but as most kids do when its time for rest we stayed up just talking. About 20 minutes went by and I started to hear scratching sounds coming from the closet, so I sat up and told him to stop playing around because I wasn't buying into all of this crap. He kind of disregarded my statement and just said, ""That's how it always starts..."" I told him the ghost was in his head and that he was just being childish and trying to scare me.

I also said, ""If this ghost is real why the hell can it only scratch the door, is it retarded?"" No sooner did I get those words out that the door started shaking with such force that is seemed like someone was trying to kick the dang thing in. He simply put is hands up, I guess showing me it wasn't him, but even as skeptical as I was I knew he had nothing to do with it.

The door went from banging to scratching then back again and then it just stopped. We finally went to sleep after it was quit for awhile. I was only asleep for maybe 3 hours or so before I woke up. The light was bothering me so I sat up and turned it off. I lay back down and the next thing I know this strange whooping screeching sound was right over me. Never in all my years have I heard such a sound. The next thing I remember is my friend standing on his bed to pull the light switch. He was pale as a sheet of paper and pissed off. He said, ""What the hell did you turn that off for? Now it won't leave us alone...""

We left the room and went to the living room to get away from it. It really didn't seem to care at this point, as we were leaving the room the bedroom door slammed shut opened back up and then slammed shut again. At seeing this I almost had to go check my underwear. The room sounded like a hurricane going through it. We sat just listening to all this, my friends expression never changed he was tired and mad. So we just sat there not talking just listening to this thing throw a temper tantrum in his room. When it was bored with that it started scratching on the ceiling in the living room and that continued so long I think we just stopped listening to it.

That morning I apologized to his mother for doubting her story and I honestly felt like a jackass for doing so in the first place. She told me she had been in contact with a Minister who would come and bless the house but he was waiting to do more research so he would be better prepared for the task at hand. A week went by and it continued on so my friend was sleeping in their den and they just tried to ignore it.

There was a football game that week and his sister wanted to get some photos of her in the new cheerleader outfit. So they set up a miniature photo ""shoot"" with the proper lighting and all. I was there at the time because we had just got back from paint ball practice and we were sitting around checking out her cheerleader friends who also wanted some photos on themselves. They went and dropped of the film in one of that one hour photo shops.

We were cleaning our paint ball markers when his mother showed back up with the photos and she simply said, ""You two need to see this..."" On several pictures there was a shadow, you can almost make out the image of and old lady. The pictures were taken with a semi auto camera so there was no skipping in the pictures. In each photo you see the image moving across then it stops, after a couple more pictures you see it again walking back the other way. They had a light in front of the photographer so no shadow should be there.

When they took these pictures to the Minister he was speechless. The next day the house was blessed and they have only had one encounter since. That was back in 2002 when my friend and I were about to go to Iraq. Nothing has happened since, they still own the house but aren't there very much.

Night Guard,"Florida, United States",Apparitions / Voices / Touches,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Apparitions / Voices / Touches :: Night Guard

I n late 2002 I was on stand down orders from the Army, so I went back to work. I was a Major with a security company and had to go to a post that people kept either calling in sick or would just simply refuse to go to. I meet the Officer on duty and was informed of the post orders and given a tour of the grounds. This is a Foundry (Metal shop) located in East central Florida. While going through the tour with the Officer I observed that the buildings were very old and asked if there was any building that I should not enter at all. The Officer said he couldn't think of any.

We went through the employee break room and bathroom area which were in a modular building that looked almost new. There was an older radio that was playing some country music in the corner by a microwave. The Officer walked over turned it of and then unplugged it. I thought it strange but I didn't want to talk to this man anymore than I had to, so I didn't ask questions to why he did it. He then started just talking and telling me how it was where the original railroad station used to be back a 100 years or so ago, but they moved it to were it was now. The station is now a museum in this small town and was within sight of where we were standing.

The man told of some stories he had heard about murders, rapes and all other bad things had happened there. At all this being his supervisor I asked if he was scaring other officers away so he could get the over time? He looked at me insulted and started walking away into the closest building. Once inside he produces a small black pistol and a flash light but he wasn't facing me. I had my service revolver a Smith and Wesson model 19 chambered in. 357 magnum so I pushed my coat away and unsnapped the retention strap. I stood there thinking, ""Holy crap this dude's flipped out...""

He turned around and said, ""I don't think this will help but it makes me feel better..."" All I could think to say is, I hope you have a permit for that thing. He laughed at me and stated, ""Kid I don't even have bullets for this thing..."" I figured it best to stop asking questions, because the answers weren't making much since anymore. We proceeded to walk through this huge building full of metal cutting tools and welding machines. In the center was a cleared walk space outlined with yellow florescent paint to mark the path. At the end of this building was a Security Office with a phone, radio and a desk with an old duck taped chair sitting behind it.

The Officer turned and asked me if I had planed to stay the whole night? I informed him that I was because his relief had called in sick tonight. He told me that he knew that girl (referring to the other officer) was scared out of her mind last night and he had to come in early and work a sixteen hour shift per the Colonel (my boss). It was a 12 hour post and I knew it was going to be a long night running on a couple hours of sleep the day before.

I let the Officer go home and walked the property one more time before I sat down and relaxed. I must not have noticed large this property was when I had walked it the first time, so laziness got the best of me so I went and got my jeep and drove it around the second time and just stopped in front of the building got out and walked through them. I returned to the office and called my wife and told her I was not going to be home that night and I would see her in the morning. I turned on the little radio in the office and sat down and started payroll for that week. It must have been really exciting stuff because I woke up about an hour and 45 minute later. It was dark now and I needed to make a round anyway, but first I had to take a leak. I went and got my jeep and drove down to the employee rest area unlocked the door and went in.

I was standing in front of the urinal when I heard somebody start singing, it was very faint but I heard it none the less. I got done with my bathroom break and entered the lunch room. The radio was playing so I went over and turned it off, I started walking out of the break area when it dawned on me that the Officer had turned it of and un-plugged it. So I returned to the radio and un-plugged it again. I went outside got in my jeep and drove around the grounds and checked every building twice; I thought someone had jumped the fence and was playing around. I just wondered if the person realized I was carrying hand cannon on my hip and a shotgun in my jeep.

I returned to the security office after my search didn't turn up anything and called the Colonel. I told him to keep his radio on because I might have someone on the property and may need backup. He said you know that place is haunted, don't you? I told him that the Officer had made some hints but didn't out right say it. I told him that I would not be calling him to come hold my hand, I'd call him when I knew for sure are had the person detained.

I continued to make my rounds in my jeep just in case. I went back by the break room to check the radio it was off and unplugged, cool. I then went to exit through the bathroom and I didn't even make it to the door when I heard singing. I have the only keys to the building so I must have locked the trespasser in the building. I drew my pistol and went back into the break room expecting to see some scared local kid or some crack head that got ""lost"" some how. When I entered the room not only was the door locked and there no where to hide, it was empty of life to. I walked over to the radio turned it of and unplugged it again picked it up and moved it to one of the tables across the room.

I went back outside got in my jeep and started driving downs the dirt path between the buildings. It was starting to rain (it is Florida it's either raining or about to). I was making my way back to the office when I decided to make another round by the break area. I pulled up to the building unlocked the door walked in and was rather pleased to see the radio where I left it. I locked the building back up and went back to my jeep. I started to drive the dirt path again it was raining pretty heavy at this time. I just started off when a kid (black male) in ragged clothes ran in front of my jeep. I slammed on my breaks and went to open the door when a man (big and white) in faded overalls ran the same path as the kid had. I exited the jeep grabbed a flashlight off the dash and took off after them.

At this time in my life I ran the 2 Mile in 13:02, we covered some ground when I finally drew my pistol and yelled stop or I'll shoot (I know it's corny but it's what I said). The kid kept running but the man turned and faced me. Clean cut. Built and full of rage. I drew the hammer on my revolver to single action to show I would shoot. I whipped some rain and sweat from my face with my hand holding the flash light. When I opened my eyes he was gone.

I walked his foot steps in the soft sand but they just stopped where he did. I went back to my jeep got my shotgun and tracked the footprints again from where I first saw him but it was the same out come, they just stopped.

I have more to this story but I summed up the bulk as best I could. I will post the rest latter.

Funny EVP,"Ohio, United States",Apparitions / Voices / Touches,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Apparitions / Voices / Touches :: Funny EVP

H ello. I have another EVP that I would like to post, from my archives. This one was recorded in late fall of 2007. I would like to thank everyone for their comments. Most are greatly appreciated. I know there are skeptics out there. I guess I am the only one that knows the truth. However, I am submitting this for all of the believers that want to hear my evidence. This and all of my others are not FAKE. Anyhow, on to the story.

You will hear in this short clip, my 10 year old daughter says ""Johnson"". The reason that she says that word is because we had a good recording at a tombstone with the name Johnson etched upon the marker. (A side note: this was not that same cemetery, but my daughter didn't realize that). You will then hear my daughter make a funny angry sound. Kind of like ""ANGGGH"".

She thought her 14 year old brother (my oldest son) was trailing her through the cemetery. She was yelling at him to get away from her (you know, loving siblings.) After you hear that you will hear a voice that makes a comment about the situation. This one cracks me up. Let me know what you think it says. I know what it says but I would like your opinions.

Shaking Bunk Bed,Australia,Misc,"I t was a Saturday night and my step brother and sister were staying at my house. My step sister was around 15 at the time. It was a two story house so my mum, dad, and step brother were down stairs in the rumpus room. My little sister and I were in the lounge room while my older step sister was in the spare room going to sleep.

I was watching TV on the couch when all of a sudden I heard my older sister scream. I ran in and asked her what was wrong. She told me that the bed was shaking. I told her to grow up and stop trying to scare me. So I went back out to the lounge room and sat back down to watch TV. About 15minutes past and I heard my older sister scream again. I ran back down the hall into the spare room and screamed ""What?""

Again my sister said that the bed was shaking. As I went to walk away it was shaking right in front of me. Quiet violently, as if something was holding onto it. My sister started crying and jumped off the bed. As soon as she did this the bed stopped shaking. I checked under the bed thinking that my step brother may have been playing a trick but he wasn't under there.

Could this have been a Poltergeist of some sort? I still to this day don't know if I was imagining things. But I and my older step sister have not spoken of it since.

The Yellow House On The Street,"New York, United States",Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: The Yellow House On The Street

H ello I live in a yellow house, that I believe is haunted and hear me out I'm not sure what kind of ghosts are doing this to me but any way... I live across from a cemetery, and I think this is why I'm a ghost magnet. I have all ways been thinking of ghosts even since I was about 3yrs. old.

Now I'm a lot older and have remembered this stuff, like one day I was all alone and this greenish reddish stuff came up from the cracks in my house, I'm not sure what it was but it was scary and I didn't know what to do so I wiped it up.

Once my friend and I had a sleepover. We were half asleep and from the down stairs, a door slammed shut from what it sounded like it sounded like. It was going to come upstairs but, went back down and it slammed the door again so that was scary.

Once I was in the bathroom and when I was done, I couldn't get out like something was preventing me from the outside of the room. So by then I was scared and slammed the door open and ran out side of the house.

Once I heard a scary noise and then I felt hands on my shoulders, and I screamed of torture and my mom came in and asked what was wrong, and I told her and she said it was just a dream and to go back to sleep but I know it was not any dream.

Once I got home from a long day of school, and I took a nap and woke up with a black eye, and bruises, and a lot of cuts, on my back and arms so I don't know what it was but it really hurt.

My Supposedly Haunted Life,"Missouri, United States",A Haunted Life,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: A Haunted Life :: My Supposedly Haunted Life

E ver since I could remember I have had experiences. They started when I was six years old, maybe a little older. My parents were divorced. So on the weekends I was at my dad's house in a small town. This was an old farm house. It had five other buildings on the property.

I don't even know were to start. The first thing that I can think of is things would fly off of shelves. One time my step brother, step sister and I were in my brother's room. We were going to go on a hike in the woods so we were getting things together. When all of a sudden I saw something move at the corner of my eye. I pushed my step brother out of the way just in time or he would have gotten hit in the head by a small flower pot. Let's just say we got out of there fast.

Another thing we've had problems with is well things moving around. TV changing channels on its own. Seeing apparitions. Last but not definitely least the thing that threw me and my step brother over the edge. Is that one night it was very late. My dad and step mom were sleeping. We were watching TV when all of a sudden the house started shaking slightly. We turned the TV on mute to hear it and you could feel floor vibrate. The ceiling fan was shaking and not even on. I told my step brother that if it continued we would get my dad just as I said that things fell silent. But not even for a minute it came back louder than ever. We ran screaming to my dad. Well I save the other stories for later!

Spooky Neighborhood,"North Carolina, United States",Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: Spooky Neighborhood

W hen my children were growing up, we lived in an old neighborhood of Fayetteville, North Carolina.Within walking distance of where we lived are the ruins of the Fayetteville Arsenal, which was burned by William Sherman's forces in March of 1865.

The actual arsenal grounds were much more extensive, and following the Civil War much of it was developed into a residential area which, like most such areas in many cities, has had a series of ups and downs over the years.

Apparently no one is sure of just what other buildings connected to the Arsenal were constructed, or where. The only surviving structure is a small wooden house that was part of the officers' quarters; no one knows, for instance, where the infirmary may have been located, but evidently the people who occupied the grounds still remember.

There were a lot of things of a pretty peculiar nature that occurred when my two boys and I moved into an apartment within two blocks of the grounds.

One of my neighbors told me of the odd occurrences in her apartment--most notably of the presence of something very feminine. One afternoon she was napping and felt a bit chilled, only to have an afghan on the back of her couch placed over her. This, of course, was when she was home alone.

It wasn't long before my younger son and I had encounters of our own.

Mine was simply olfactory--I awoke one night to a strong smell of sulphur. Now, I am a history buff, and the first thing I thought was NOT demon or evil entity, but disinfectant. I know that burning sulphur was used air least as recently as the 1930's as a fumigant in sickrooms.

One summer evening, he was sitting on the porch. At that time, he was about eleven or twelve years old, and across the street was an overgrown lot where a house had once stood. He told me that he'd seen a man in a Civil War uniform in that lot who had half of his face missing. He'd always been one to see things that most of us don't, so he was used to it and it didn't scare him in the least.

Much more common were the shadow figures we frequently observed flitting around at that particular intersection.

We've long since moved away, and both my boys are grown now. The vacant lot is no longer vacant, but now occupied by some business connected with wireless communications.

One of my friends still lives in the area, and I recently asked her if anything is still seen around there. Apparently the phenomena have decreased with the advent of the cell phone place, because she says the sightings have become quite rare.

Paulding Light,"Michigan, United States",Misc,"A few years back I went to visit some friends in Houghton MI for a weekend. On Saturday night we went out to see the local haunting, a popular spot. If I remember correctly we went to what might have been a national park, there was a large path that took us through a field of tall grass.

After a few minutes of walking I would start to feel intensely frightened, would take two steps and feel fine. This happened two or three times. It was very unnerving, but we kept going. One person suggested that it may be residual feelings from other people who have come by.

I think it was a fifteen minute trip when we decided to stop. The sight its self was a simple. It was a white globe that was moving there was no tail while it moved and, from our distance, nothing that looked like it was man made. There was no pattern that I could see, it was graceful. It seemed peaceful.

After a while of watching the globe, we started talking about heading back to the house. When I looked down to see a figure that looked like a Romero zombie coming out of the ground! When it got closer I realized it was a very drunk girl who had decided to move in closer to the globe and was crawling up the steep incline we had decided to stop at. It was an odd way to end the night. We had a good laugh at that.

The legend I heard about the lights is about an old railway man who still walks his line after an accident. The trail runs along the line of an old track, but I do not remember if the track was still there or not. Either way it was an interesting time and one day I want to return.

I wish I could tell you exactly where it is, but I do not know the area well enough and it was out a ways from the town. Also, we were not doing any official ghost hunting, though one day I think I might want to go back and get closer.

I have terrible night vision from living in the city all my life.

Cemetary Bubbles,"Illinois, United States",Misc,"T his story doesn't have the concrete research and prolonged experiences that my last story, ""An Illinois Haunting"" had, but it's something I still think about and question.

For Memorial Day every year, my mother and I like to buy a bunch of flowers to plant in front of our deceased relatives' headstones. We have to make the trek to about 3-4 cemeteries, all in the city of Chicago. The year of this story is 2001. I was in my senior year of high school. This was actually the first year that we decided to make this activity a tradition, and I was really excited to visit all of the old cemeteries. I'm not creeped out by being in cemeteries at all, and I really enjoy taking in the beauty and artistry of old headstones and monuments.

We were at the second cemetery of the day, St. Luke's, which is predominately German-Lutheran. My mom was busy planting flowers, and I was slightly bored doing that, and decided to wander around and check out the different monuments. It's a pretty big place, but I always had her SUV in view - it's pretty hard to miss since it is bright yellow!

I was a fairly good distance from her when I felt the temperature drop slightly, it could have been the shade from the trees, but it was a very hot day. Then I began to notice bubbles floating around. There weren't too many of them, but they seemed to only be floating maybe a foot to two feet off the ground. It kind of made me laugh because I thought maybe there was a family with a small child there, but I looked all over that area and couldn't find anything or anyone that could explain this. I didn't see any caretakers, visitors, or vehicles. I tried to follow the bubbles to see if they led anywhere, but they would just float and then attach to the grass or burst.

At this point I was confused and disoriented, and I couldn't see where my mom's car was. I finally made it back to her after jogging a bit. I explained what happened to her and we drove over there but couldn't see any person or thing that could have created bubbles.

These were not orbs, they were real bubbles, and I know it sounds crazy, but I just wanted to see if anyone else had heard or experienced anything like this?

Hobo Ghost,"Virginia, United States",Poltergeists / Physical Manifestations,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Poltergeists / Physical Manifestations :: Hobo Ghost

A year ago I was with my sister and her friends walking down our dirt road when I saw this hobo sitting on the ground with his back against a tree.  It's not unusual to see a hobo in our county, but not down our road. So I whispered to my sister,""There's is a hobo over there.""  She responded, ""What hobo?"" And to my suprise there was no hobo there anymore. Well then two days ago I went to my friend's graduation party. Me and her are really into the supernatural. She knows everything and has had tons of freaky things happen to her. And you should always listen to her when she says something sort of creepy.

Well, I was telling her about it and when I was done my parents said we had to leave. And right before we left she said,""Keep an eye out for it.""  Like there was something significant about it. So right now I am kind of creeped out about it and I don't know anything about a hobo ghost or can't find any stories on why it would be significant. But she ask me if it had blue jeans. And it did have blue jeans. And I think it had a hat. It was pretty detailed yet a little transparent.

That same day I saw a big black shadow that defintely was a figure of a man. It walked across my driveway from one side of the woods to the other. I got really freaked out and locked the door because I thought it might be like a psycho killer dude walking in our woods. This one though had no color or detail like the other. This one was opaque. Just a a dark shadow manly figure. Does any one know the significance of the hobo? It would be very appreciated.

My Very 1st Ouija Experience,"Florida, United States",Ouija Board / Seances,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Ouija Board / Seances :: My Very 1st Ouija Experience

H i, my name is Chris, as you may know from reading my last story, I'm from a small town in the deep southern parts of Georgia. I moved to Florida back in 1998 and had resided there up until 2007 when I joined the USMC, and now I am stationed overseas here in Okinawa, Japan. This story takes place at one of my best friend's houses in the small neighborhood in northern Florida, where I had most recently lived back in the states.

It was the middle of the Summer of 2006 (if I recall correctly). My friend, his two brothers, his mother, his mother's boyfriend, and myself were talking about the paranormal or something of that sort. So my friend's little brother took out this Ouija Board, and they were talking about using it to talk to spirits. So we all went into the master bathroom (that was the only place that was quiet being since my boy's grandmother was in the living room watching TV) and gathered there to try this new thing.

They started off asking simple questions like, ""Is there anyone in here?"" or, ""If there's anyone in here please let us know,"" but nothing. After about 5 minutes and we were all about to give up, we asked it once again, ""Is there anyone in here?"" and the planchette slowly moved to ""yes."" I took my hand off and asked if that was them messing with me. They smiled and looked at me and said ""No, its moving by itself..."" So, me being skeptical started asking only personal questions about myself, per se. Who I was dating at the time (none of them knew then).  And other simple things of that sort. The board answered, to my disbelief, the correct answers. So, I then went a little more personal. Asking the board questions about my past and things having to do with my grandmother that had died in 1991 in a tragic car accident. Everything was right!

I was amazed by this connection to the outside world. Mind you that by now it's just my friend's little brother because everyone else had gotten bored and went to bed, and it was around 1 or 2 am. We were talking to his deceased father that had passed in 2003 as well. To make sure it was him we would ask him questions about how he died and if he was in the house or looked after the three boys all the time, and he said yes.

We had talked to one other spirit that night that was very wierd because it was suppposedly the spirit of young child from Mexico that was also killed in an accident, and that had missed his parents and family. He spelled the words out; not that of a child's spelling, but just as if you and I were on the board.

That night wasn't at all discomforting or bad feeling. It felt very welcoming and cozy talking to the spirits of the deceased. So, then after that night came a series of nights where we would use the board and talk to these spirits. The next story I will post will be about two experiences in the same night. So stand by for that one. It's definitely a little more disturbing.

Supper Time Ghost,Japan,Apparitions / Voices / Touches,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Apparitions / Voices / Touches :: Supper Time Ghost

T o make things a little more clear, I want to give a little background detail of the house that I lived in. The house was an older traditional-style Japanese house. The kitchen/living room area was on the opposite side of the house from where the bedrooms (including mine) were. I also was the only one on the side of the house because my Host Mother was in the kitchen cooking supper and the rest of my host family was out working late. The cat was outside too. My bedroom door was a fancy sliding door that was made of frosted glass, so I would've seen someone walk by. Also, the ceiling in the hallway leading to the other side of the house from my bedroom is kind of low (because I'm an unnecessarily tall Canadian hehehe).

It was a little bit before supper and I wanted to go and relax in my room. I laid down on my bed and started to reflect on how my day went. As I laid there, I got a strange feeling; it was a kind of excited, eerie feeling. I looked toward my door. I stared at it when all of a sudden, a black, shadowy arm from the ceiling, came down and knocked on the window of my door! I was flabbergasted! I went to my door cautiously and opened it, I looked up to the ceiling to find nothing there! At that moment, my Host Mother called me to supper. I ran to my Host Mother and told what had happened. She laughed at me and told me that I was just paranoid. Anyway, that night I had a little trouble falling asleep.
