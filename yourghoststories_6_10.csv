Two Chances,Canada,Family / Friends Visits,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Family / Friends Visits :: Two Chances

W hen my brother was around the age of 6, he was afraid of nothing. One night, my uncle Jack had died. He never had the chance to say goodbye since he was in a car accident. One night, 2 weeks after my uncle jack's death, my brother was getting ready to bed with no worry. Finally, it was around 2:00 am and he had already been asleep for a long time. He woke up to see some man sitting down on stairs, the man was just sitting there, looking straight at him. Since my brother wasn't scared of anything, he just went back to sleep. In the morning, he asked my dad ""who was that man sitting on the stairs last night?"" My dad got all worried thinking it was a robber or something, he asked ""what did this man look like?"" My brother said it was really dark, but he had a lot of hair on his face and sort of long hair. It turned out that my uncle jack was the same description of this man.

Another time, when my parents had family over, the spoon kept falling out of the bowl. They said ""no worries, it's just our ghost"". My aunt is a psychic and said ""you know you have a ghost?"" and my parents said ""yes we do"". Well, when I came in the door, I saw this man at the top of the stairs waiting for me. Also, while the spoon was failing out of the bowl, I saw this lady standing beside our grandmother (there was this picture of my Great Grandmother above her). The psychic said the person looks just like the person in that picture.

Numerous Encounters,Mexico,Old Hags / Night Attacks / Sleep Paralysis,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Old Hags / Night Attacks / Sleep Paralysis :: Numerous Encounters

W hen I lived in mexico, I was constantly hearing and seeing many supernatural things. I was not as scared as I am now, but it was the worst and the best part in my life. When I was 16 years old and I heard a lady's voice saying my name while my body reached the state of sleep paralysis, I couldn't do anything, I tried to move, but I couldn't even open my eyes, I was trying to figure out if it was maybe my mom, but then it grabbed me by both ankles and moved me straight on my side and she laid down beside me.  tried to move my lips to speak but I just babbled a bit, then words finally came out ""are... you my... mom?"" I prayed and kept praying, then I could finally open my eyes, but I knew it she left. I suddenly heard the laughing voice of my mom at the neighbors and by then, I knew it couldn't have been her.

The ghost lady still stayed in the same house I lived in, but she started to become a bother to my mom, and my mother would constantly say a barrel full of curses and the women got mad and she kept continuously throwing my mother off the bed or tripping her. I always heard my mom tell about it to my dad but he would never believe what she'd say.

Once she made it clear to him. One day in november 20th, there would always be a festival at my town and my father told me and my mom to go and he'd pick us up when it would end. In the middle of a dance, when I saw my dad and when I was finished, I asked if it was time to go, but he answered ""no, we'll stay until it's over"".

When we got home, he told me and my mother what happened. When he was in bed for a little rest, he felt something moving the bed and he thought it was a animal, but then he looked down and he saw nothing and he fled like there was no tomorrow. Me and my mom were a bit surprised but at last, he believed us.

Now I'm a mother of two children and I still remember what happened and now I'm relieved it's over.

The Boy in the Delivery Room,Philippines,Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: The Boy in the Delivery Room

I remembered the first and last time I saw a ghost when I was in 4th grade. It was very terrifying, when a chubby girl wearing black dress and waving a black handkerchief was floating right in front of me at the kindergarten room of our school. It was my first and last time I saw one, beyond what my eyes can see. But hearing unusual voices and caresses of weird wind never stopped until I reach in my present age. It always made me feel goosebumps! Though, I'm trying to ignore it.

I'm in 3rd year BS Nursing right now and we are already having our practicum in the delivery room. I never heard such ghostly stories before in that area of a certain hospital (I will not mention the hospital's name for privacy). It was my first time then to have my practicum at the delivery room and our shift is from 11 pm until 7 am on the next day. We only had 2 patients in the labor room that time. At 1 am one of the patients gave birth, and right after the delivery, she was transferred in to her desired room at the ward. So me, with my co-nursing students, would remain in our area and monitor the patient left in the labor room. Everybody was tired, of course, including the staffs and a few minutes after the delivery, everyone seemed to fall asleep. I was the one left awake, cleaning the Kelly pad and whatsoever DR instruments.

I felt weird at that time and was uncomfortable doing my task, but I just ignore it. While cleaning the instruments, I felt somebody walking behind me. I thought it was one of my classmates so I turned around and tried to approach something, but when I turned, nobody was there, only a gust of wind that passed through me. ""Gosh! That's weird!"" I told myself. Well, I still continued what I was doing.

Later, I felt sleepy too. It was already 2:30 am in the morning, I walked into the labor room to check the parturient vital signs and I sat on the chair at the corner of the door, near to one of the beds in the labor room. I closed my eyes and leaned my head on the wall. Suddenly, something tried to wake me up. I slowly opened my eyes and I saw someone pacing along the labor room. I thought it was the staff nurse giving medicine to the patient but it wasn't. The figure was smaller than the size of an adult. I tried to figure it out who is she or he could be. When my vision seemed clear, I saw a little boy. It was a little boy even though he was not facing at me. He was jumping and jumping at the other corner of the labor room. I wondered how this little boy got inside.

I tried to stand up and ask him but I couldn't move. Even my fingers couldn't move and no words would come out in my mouth. I told myself ""this is not normal anymore, that little boy in white shirt could not be like me. He could be others"". My heart beats very fast and I don't have any idea what to do. Everybody is still sleeping and I can't even cry for help because I can't speak. Again, I felt goosebumps and another weird gust of wind passed through me that made me feel cold and chilly. I said ""calm down Jessa, calm down, pray, pray, pray..."", and so I did. Then everything shut down after my last prayer.

I heard voices around me. I slowly opened my eyes then I saw some of my classmates were awake and they were monitoring the patient. I looked at my wrist watch and it was 5 am. That was so weird and scary. I tried not to tell anyone until 7 am. I asked my classmates if they felt something that's not right in the delivery room, well, half of them said that they had and other half noticed nothing.

Weeks passed, we returned in the delivery room for our next concept. We're on the afternoon shift and lucky for us, we don't have any patients to monitor in the labor room. So our clinical instructress discussed something related to our concept and the discussion switched into some ghostly stories. I kept my mouth shut and tried not to tell any one about what I had experienced during my last duty. And one of my classmates talked about some ghostly stories about the area that she heard from other students. She heard that there's a spirit of a little boy playing along the labor room. As well as my clinical instructress, she opened to us about her personal experiences in the labor room.

Our Cat General,"Colorado, United States",Pets / Animals,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Pets / Animals :: Our Cat General

I t happened one night when I was in Montana visiting my Aunt and my Cousin. My mom had called me to tell me that our cat General had just died. I was devastated. A week later, when I arrived back home in Colorado, I was sitting in my living room watching TV when I heard this familiar scratching noise. General used to make this noise all the time. So I was curious and I stood up and looked in the kitchen. There he was. It was like he was not even dead. He looked alive and actually there. Like you could go pet him. So as curious as I was, I got up and went over into my kitchen. Then he was gone. I never told anyone about it that night.

That was until my mom kept complaining of some weird scratching noise at her door at 3 o'clock every morning. At first, she thought it was either me or my Twin brother. That was until one weekend, we were up staying at our dad's house, like we did every other weekend, when she heard it again. At that moment, she new that something was in our house. At first she thought we might have mice. And then she thought twice about that, considering it was winter and they weren't out at that time.

The night I came back from my dad's house, my mom and I were sitting on the couch watching a movie when she suddenly jumped up and looked into the kitchen. I didn't think much of it until she starting yelling ""BREE. IT'S...ITS... G...GENERAL... H...HE'S IN... IN THE K...KITCHEN"", that's when I knew she had seen him to and that it just wasn't me.

After 3 years of seeing him on and off, he just suddenly stopped showing up. Like he had moved on or something. We just recently moved to California about 8 months ago and just bought a new house about a week ago. There is no sign of him yet... But my mom and I both have some crazy idea going threw our heads that he will show up here... He will.

Girl in a Dress,United Kingdom,Apparitions / Voices / Touches,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Apparitions / Voices / Touches :: Girl in a Dress

I have only just found out that my house in haunted. I can't believe I'm writing this down now. It feels like someone is watching me. My mum is at the hospital for depression. One day, my mum and my grandma and granddad came round for doctor who. When they left, I ran back upstairs to the bathroom and saw a little girl out the corner of my eye. I ran down crying and my grandma said ""you probably stared at your sister for a while and saw her again"". No one believes me and that makes me mad.

Well, my mum believes me I think, because she said that she saw that before when we moved into this house. I don't know if she's lying because parents do lie to stop you from being scared. It always feels cold upstairs now and my hairs at the back of my neck stick up. I can't talk about it upstairs and I'm very amazed that I'm typing it. At the moment, I'm sweating like mad trying to type this in real quick to get it over with. When I fell over by the bathroom (the same one where I saw it), I think the ghost did it, so I blamed it on the ghost. If you're wandering why falling over was a big deal, I had my baby sister who is 2 in my arms as well!

One morning, I thought that if I took a photo of it with my dad's phone it might be there and I would have proof. I was moving the camera around to get a perfect picture when a white thing ran past me from the shower. It seemed to be very shy and not a problem.

This week, me and my friends in the G.T.S ghost hunting club are going to try and take a photo of it.

The Hair Lady,United Kingdom,Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: The Hair Lady

M y mum is a hairdresser but she only does it on the side of her usual job (working with my dad) for friends and family etc. When I was younger, my mum would do the hair of this little old lady who lived alone. Sometimes my mum would drag me and my sisters to this old lady's house while she cut her hair because there was no one to look after us.

Eventually this old lady died in her sleep at her house. Of course the house was sold. A few months after this, my mum went to our neighbors Body Shop Party. After awhile, all the women got talking and my mum realized that one of the women there had actually moved into the old lady's house. This women (Julie) revealed to my mum that she thought the house was haunted and poltergeist activity like plates being thrown, radios turned on and off were happening. Also, Julie's son said that an old lady would stand at the end of his bed at night. My mum asked julie to describe the ghost and it was an exact description of the old lady! My mum then told Julie that an old lady she knew had lived and died there.

This julie was so scared she eventually got someone from the local church to come bless or what ever it is they do to the house! After that everything stopped!

The Headless Ghost Man,"Texas, United States",Apparitions / Voices / Touches,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Apparitions / Voices / Touches :: The Headless Ghost Man

I 'm 20 years old as I write this story. What I am about to tell you happened to me and my brother when I was about 12 or 13 and he was 16 or 17. We had just moved into a house inside the city limits of our town and my brother and I would sit out on the front porch every night to talk.

One night, as we were both standing out there, we glanced towards the steps and looked right at each other with a scared look on our faces as we had both seen the same thing... What we saw was a man standing there, without a head, we knew it was a man because he was wearing a blue, long sleeved shirt and some blue jeans and his body was that of a man. When we looked at each other, he asked me if I had saw that and I said yea and he asked me what I saw and I told him a man with no head and I told him to describe what he was wearing, so I could believe that we had seen the same thing, and he described the man to me just as I had seen him. We ran inside and told our parents... who of course didn't believe us. But we were scared shiatless!

The following week I was in my room and had my windows open (during the day) and I saw a man pass by the window wearing the exact same clothes as the headless man and I ran outside, but since it was a quick glance, I didn't think of it being the headless man until I got outside and saw no one there. I thought it was my dad, but he was still at work.

Bad Workplace,United Kingdom,Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: Bad Workplace

I have recently changed jobs but before that happened, I was working at this place for about 3 and a half years. Now, I have heard a lot of stories about the building I worked in and they haven't been very nice, for instance, it used to be a farm run by a man who supposedly killed and tortured people, now I'm a bit of a skeptic when it comes to things like this, that was until about 6 months before I left, when two incidents happened I wish to never experience again.

I was walking through a hallway that leads into another room that we used for storage and it has two doors and the floor itself is tiled so it's easy to hear both the doors open and anyone who happens to walk across the room. This was at about 5pm, I heard what sounded like a man quietly talking to himself and then followed by very loud footsteps, bear in mind that I would have been able to hear the doors open, but there wasn't any sound of any doors before or after it happened.

The other incident I was walking through the same hallway, but this time I happened to see what looked like a tall dark outline of a person standing in the corner of a small room that links up to the hallway. I stopped and looked back into the room and I saw the figure still standing there but without any legs. Now I have heard stories that ghosts are not there to hurt people but this was a different case, the figure that I was staring at suddenly rushed towards me, followed by a faint but harrowing sound of someone screaming like they are in horrible pain.

Skepticism is no longer an issue for me as this was an experience I never wish to encounter ever again.

Second Floor Haunting,"Maryland, United States",Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: Second Floor Haunting

T his isn't exactly a story, but I need comments and opinions on this. In my upstairs hallway, you always hear creaking footsteps (more than the ones from a normal person) even when you're the only one in the house. You also could swear that you feel someone watching you from it. As I type this, I feel it (the computer room from the hallway). I myself have seen a few things but I'm only able to see it from the corner of my eye. If I look straight on the shadow, either it completely disappears or I see a faint aura kind of thing just without the person in the middle of it.

Sometimes you hear faint tapping, scrapping, or, breathing. I'll also sense it in my room as I try to sleep... Or do anything really. I can also tell it's close because I can't breath or move right, like I'm frozen or something. It usually happens when the lights are out in my room or the hallway. As I'm unable to move, I can half see where it is but I usually can only sense it.

Is it possible that my family brought it here? Or that we created it ourselves? I think there may be two of them, one is in my bedroom, it's only been bothering me... I don't have any old or antique stuff in there.

Windy,"Mississippi, United States",Haunted Places,"M y name is Lexi. I live in a small town in George County Mississippi. When I tell about Windy to my friends and family, they laugh, like I'm joking. I'm not joking or making this up. My story 100% true. Windy is the ghost that lives in my house. I don't know what her real name is, but I feel like she's a female, and she tends to get angry when I call her ""the ghost"". She's not mean or harmful, just mischievous.

One time, I was talking to my mom on the phone. I got mad at her and threw the phone at my bed. I went and sat by my dresser, which is a few feet away from my door. My bed is a few feet away from the dresser. When I sit in that spot, I can see everybody that comes in, but they can't see me. I was just sitting there, thinking to myself when my dad walked in. He asked me where the phone was because he wanted to use it. I told him it was on my bed. We looked and looked but we couldn't find it. When I finally found it, it was on the charger in the kitchen. I didn't put it there, and nobody had entered my room.

Things like this happen all the time. My things will go missing, but then reappear in different places.

Loose Screws,Canada,Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: Loose Screws

T his happened about 3 years ago when I moved in to the house I am living in now. I had been listening to music, on my MP3 Player. It hadn't been too loud. I was reading something as well. There was a knock on my bedroom door, I put down my MP3 Player to see if my mother wanted in. Nobody was there. I hadn't noticed the four screws that held my computer chair together had fallen out. When I sat on the chair, I had fallen off and I had actually gotten very hurt. There was a very strong wind, like someone or something had gotten mad, because I hadn't broken anything.

At night, while I was going to bed, something had whispered a word in to my ear, I couldn't tell what it was saying. My hair had been pulled, hard. I ran to my mother's room and told her. She did not believe me. I was only 10 then. But I showed her the bruise I had gotten from my chair. She took me to the hospital and my muscle was ""somehow"" pulled.

After that, I always heard whispers in my ear or had ""accidentally"" hurt myself. This spirit seemed mad at me. Or frustrated that I did not understand what it had whispered. But it seems like there had been more then just one of them. Maybe 2 or 3? One was on my side, one very angry at me? It could not have been anyone in my family that had died. If it was, I would have been having these strange situations a long time ago.

I don't know what to do. I can't move out, I know that. But the spirit seems to want me to help it. I feel like something bad has happened here.

My History with Sleep Paralysis,"California, United States",Old Hags / Night Attacks / Sleep Paralysis,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Old Hags / Night Attacks / Sleep Paralysis :: My History with Sleep Paralysis

H ello Everyone! - Although I have been an avid reader of the stories listed on the this sight for several months, I have not yet posted any of my experiences, even though I have several, from sleep paralysis, to sleep walking, to ghostly encounters. In this post, I'll cover my experiences with sleep paralysis:

The first incident with sleep paralysis occurred when I was just 12 years old. My little sister and I shared a large bed in our room. I woke up in the middle of the night to find our bedroom glowing in a strange green color. I lifted my head and looked around the room in awe. Our house had a remarkable view of the city lights and as usual, they were shining brightly through the window that night. It was then that I realized that I couldn't move. I tried so hard to move, but I couldn't budge any part of my body. I looked over at my sister and she was sleeping calmly. I became desperate and began to struggle with all my strength. I raised my arms towards my head and I could feel my finger tips touching my shoulders, but when I looked down, my arms were still laying at my sides. I was terrified!

I began to scream for my mom, but could barely let out a whimper. Not even my sister heard me. This event lasted five, maybe ten minutes. My only choice was to just lay there and hope this would pass. I drifted back to sleep and woke up fine the next morning. I'm 31 now, so this occurred 19 years ago and is still a very vivid memory to me.

My next occurrence was just a few years later, I was about 15 then and by then, we were living in a different house. This time, I was sleeping in my own bed when I woke up late one morning (the sun was shining brightly through my window). I was face up and I once again couldn't move. I felt a warm and heavy sensation on my back, like I was laying on one of those awesome back massagers. What I could also remember was the sound of mechanical voices all around me. I couldn't make out what was being said, but it was like many different voices talking to each other, but they definitely weren't human. I was more curious than terrified this time. This didn't last too long, maybe five minutes or so, then I drifted back to sleep and woke up fine.

I seem to remember having one or two other incidents similar to this near the same time frame. In one of those incidents, I was laying on my side, and I could feel that warm and heavy sensation on my back again with the extra sensation that there was someone there with me. I never saw anyone, just sensed it. I still have to admit, I wasn't too scared.

Years went by with nothing really to report regarding these encounters. Then, a few years ago, they started happening to me again. I had an incident when I was taking nap on my couch. I woke up and I couldn't move. I was extra scared this time because I'm a single mom and my young son was in the house. I prayed that there was nothing medically wrong with me and that this thing would just pass. Thankfully, it did. I didn't see any strange lights this time, nor the back sensation, nor the voices. I seemed to just snap out of it and woke up. A short time later, a few days later, this occurred to me again on the same couch and in the same position.

I'm pretty sure I've had one or two more encounters in my bedroom, but honestly, I don't remember much about them because they were boring, no levitating, no voice, no demons, no spooks yelling or anything like that.

My most recent episode was just two months ago. This time I was in my bedroom in the late afternoon and I was taking a nap, I think I may have been a little under the weather, because I'm not really a napper. I was lying face down this time and my head was laying on my right arm that was near the opening in the middle of my head board where I store books and magazines. I woke up with a jolt and found that I was not able to move. I sensed someone in my room with me, but I wasn't too scared this time. I actually found this episode amusing because I realized something very important (so please read on).

While I was struggling to move, I lifted my head a little and I saw my TV's remote control near my right hand and I struggled to reach for it (Why would I reach for the remote of all things? I don't know! It seemed like a great idea at the time! Ha ha ha). Anyway I managed to grab it and place it in the opening of my head board. I struggled to move the rest of my body now and I was barely able to. I really felt like I had come far this time, really succeeded in beating this strange occurrence by moving a few inches. I was exhausted from that and I drifted back to sleep and then woke up just a little bit later.

I went back to the living for awhile and then decided to retire to my bedroom for the rest of the evening. I went to grab the remote control from where I placed it during my little incident only to find that it wasn't there! It was on the other side of the bed and on the top of the headboard exactly where I had put it before I had taken my nap. This proves that I was dreaming when this incident happened to me because I saw the remote control laying on my bed right next to my hand and it was this remote that I swear I could feel in my hand. There was nothing else in that headboard area that I could have mistaken for the remote control. It felt so real, but I know in my mind it was just a dream.

Now that you've read my stories, I'll let you in on my secret. A few years ago, I watched an interesting medical show on sleep paralysis. I was shocked because when they described all the nooks and crannies of sleep paralysis, I realized that it was exactly what I had experienced. Unfortunately for those people who were shown on TV, they experienced far worse than me, demons, aliens, levitations, all sorts of creepy things when they had episodes of sleep paralysis. I will admit that my experiences don't compare with theirs, but I truly feel that they are based on the same phenomenon: sleep paralysis.

I feel that we can choose what we see when we dream and have sleep paralysis episodes. I feel that what we see is based on our cultural upbringing, for example, a good friend of mine confided in me that he had his own experiences contain a black shadow that sits on his chest and suffocates him while he slept. He went on to tell me that in his Hmong (asian) culture, they believe this is an evil spirit that comes to suffocate you while you sleep if you've been too cocky. Once I told him that it was probably just sleep paralysis, he breathed a sigh of relief and hasn't had any more episodes.

So, while I was experiencing sleep paralysis in the last few years, I knew it was only sleep paralysis and the level of terror that I felt when I had an episode was a bare minimum. The mind is a powerful instrument and combined with our vivid imaginations, we don't need Stephen King novels or scary movies, just our own dreams to scare the snot out of us. My advice to those of you who suffer from these episodes is to be strong willed and if that doesn't work, start praying before you go to sleep! Take care and God bless.

House of the Little People,Philippines,Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: House of the Little People

H i hope you guys liked by previous story Grinning Lady . This time my story was told to me by my Dad, that's why I know it's true. This happened before I was born. My parents had just gotten married and my uncle as well. My parents are staying with my grandparents until they left for the US and my uncle moved to a house just in front of it. These houses are built on an old rice field and this rice field has witnessed World War II.

My story begins when my uncle hired a maid to look after their house because they are not there all the time. In just a few days, it was morning then, the maid came up to my uncle and asked if my aunt called her in the middle of the night. My uncle said 'no' and asked why. The maid said that a little lady like voice was calling her name. My uncle did not believe her and just said that she might be dreaming. The maid had thought that it might be a dream. This happened a few times and my uncle as well as my dad just brushed it off thinking that she's just making up a story.

But that's what they thought when one Saturday afternoon, after coming home from a tennis match, my dad, mom, uncle and aunt was shocked when they saw my grandparents talking to a couple of police officers. They asked why and the police said that the maid was found hiding behind my grandparent's refrigerator, all freaked out and shouting, 'they are going to get me, they are going to get me!' They asked on who is going to get her and she said 'the little people living in my uncle's house!'

The maid was eventually brought to the hospital and when released was brought to their hometown. The doctors said that she had some psychological issues before. This is again what my uncle and parents thought.

A few years later when I was 7 and my uncle had moved out of the house, the house was rented to a couple with one child. They came to my dad and said that they have locked themselves out. My dad has the spare key and quickly went to the house. He was about to insert the key in the key whole when the door just slowly opened by itself. He asked the couple if they have really checked that their door was locked and they said yes. My dad now believes that there is something not normal in that house.

Being Watched,United Kingdom,Poltergeists / Physical Manifestations,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Poltergeists / Physical Manifestations :: Being Watched

T his happened just recently actually. Geez I don't know why ghostly things keep happening, they drive me mad. I was sitting in my bedroom on my bed reading. After awhile, one of my many china dolls fell off the shelf to the left of my bed. I saw it fall from the corner of my eye, it had fallen head first, and it landed on my floor unbroken. I didn't think anything of it, so I bent down to pick it up. I then noticed it was the doll my Dead Great Grandmother had left to me in her Will. Now, this doll doesn't have a stand and so I had leaned it against the wall and stuck a small block of wood by its feet to stop it sliding off the shelf.

I thought it was a little strange but propped the doll back up and carried on reading. Literally seconds after I picked my book up, I had the strongest feeling of being watched! I have had this before but it was always just my imagination freaking me out. But this felt different! It was so strong! I was weirded out so I just sat there. Out the corner of my eye the same damn doll fell off head first! How could it fall off head first! It was leaning against the wall with a block of wood in the way! Whether there's a logical explanation or whether my Great Grandma was communicating with me! I have no idea!

Well... If any other weird things happen I'll be sure to put it on this site.

Being Held Down by a Ghost,"Michigan, United States",Old Hags / Night Attacks / Sleep Paralysis,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Old Hags / Night Attacks / Sleep Paralysis :: Being Held Down by a Ghost

T he other night, It started in my dream and it wasn't an unpleasant dream either, but then I felt something was interfering in my dream, whatever it was, it wouldn't allow me to move, it felt as if gravity around my body was 10 times the regular force that it normally is. After awakening from this dream, I laid there for few seconds wondering if what I had just felt was actually an evil presence holding me down while I slept, or if it was in fact just a dream. Just after pondering the experience, I began to feel an unexplainable sensation through out my body, and then as I was awake, I could not move, some sort of force was taking place around my body, I felt paralyzed only because I couldn't move, but I still had control of my muscles, every muscle in my body was flexed to try and either get up or get out of bed but I couldn't. I was also trying my hardest to scream but all that would come out was a faint whisper. After a few more minutes of fighting my hardest against this force it finally stopped.

I don't know if it was an attempted for demon to try and posses me or what. I usually don't believe this stuff but that was freaky. After this experience, I got online around 3 a.m. in the morning to try and find some sort of explanation, after reading other information, people are saying it's simple, you awoke in REM state, which is when you wake up while your brain is not sending signals to the rest your body, leaving your body paralyzed but apparently you can still see and think in this state you just have no control of your body.

This was not my case, after the dream that seemed to have some sort of interference, I had fully awaken and was aware that I was awake because I had turned over to get more comfortable, with that being said I feel there was no way possible I was still in rem state, because I was able to MOVE, see, and think clearly moments before I began to have unexplainable sensation through out my body followed by being held down.

If someone can explain it other then being in rem state, please explain or help me understand Craigster586 [at] hotmail.com

The only advice I can give people who have had this situation is if you can, stay calm, but stay in control of your self. DON'T lay and try to be amazed like some people are also posting, this is nothing to be amazed about.

They're Not Just Hallucinations,United Kingdom,Apparitions / Voices / Touches,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Apparitions / Voices / Touches :: They're Not Just Hallucinations

I 'm 12 and I know all you adults are going to think I'm hallucinating and imagining things but I swear I'm not. I tell myself I don't believe in ghosts because I don't. I'm not sure what to believe anymore. I think I have a ghost following me, only in the house though. I feel his (I think it's a boy) presence every time I go into my room and I always feel like there is someone else in the room. I sort of shiver really hard when I know they're there and some of my body parts go cold. I think that's when he touches me. Like sometimes I feel it on my cheek or wrist but nowhere else.

This is really freaking me out. I mean it only started a few weeks ago! I hear noises coming from my desk and the chair going down (which is what it does when someone sits down on it) but noone sat there. One time, I woke up by a rattling on my desk. I went to check my objects to see if it was a pen moving about or something but nothing was moving. Then I got really cold and began to shiver hard. And it wasn't because I was cold.

I just want it to go away. I see a fuzzy outline sometimes but when I look at it directly it disappears. Like blurry dots or a white fluffy thing. It's really scary.

Doors and Windows Opening on their Own,"Wisconsin, United States",Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: Doors and Windows Opening on their Own

F irst off, I would like to say this really did happen it wasn't an illusion and I'm not making it up so for those of you that will comment to say it was a illusion or something, don't waste your time commenting my story. When I was around 7, my family lived in a big old farm house we called the kesler house (Kesler was the last name of the owner). I had a really big room with a door leading to a balcony. I remember the sound of someone laughing and it sounded like giants were running on the roof over my room. Whenever my parents and I left they would lock the balcony door (a dead bolt lock and a latch) but whenever we returned home the door would be wide open. My mom would sleep with me sometimes because I would tell her my room is too loud. She too would hear the same noises and had similar experiences with the house. Sometimes, all the windows would open while we were gone, or doors would be wide open when we had shut them.

We lived in that house for a year and then moved out to live closer to family.

The Man in the Jail Kitchen,"Colorado, United States",Apparitions / Voices / Touches,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Apparitions / Voices / Touches :: The Man in the Jail Kitchen

W hen I was 12, which was last year, I went to work with my mom. She worked at Boulder County Jail until I moved. Now my mom was a nurse at this Jail and worked nights. So I went to work with her. Being the adventurous type that I am, I went wondering off. I explored everywhere. I went through everything I could find. It was cool.

That night at exactly 12:00 midnight, I was looking through the little window on a door that leads to the kitchen in the jail. So as I was looking in there the big metal spoon to one of the pots starting turning. Now with that being creepy enough, the figure of a man started to appear. Or at least the outline of him did. From what I could see, he looked like he was maybe in his late 30's or early 40's and was a little bit plump. As I watched this figure turn the spoon to the pot, he looked at me straight in the eye and then he kind of faded away. I stood peering through that window for a second or two to see if he was going to come back. He never did.

A few hours later at about 2:00 AM I went back to the kitchen to see if he was there again, and he was. But this time, there was another figure in the kitchen with him. This one looked like he was about my age. I stood there amazed for a few minutes. Then both of the figures looked at me, smiled, did what looked like a wave good-bye and faded. I never saw them again.

A few nights after going to work with my mom, I asked her if any of the cooks that worked at the jail had died, and she told me this really long story about how he brought his son to work one day and they both mysteriously died at the Jail. She told me the night that I went to the jail with her was the 5 year anniversary for the death of the cook and his son.

Grandma Appearing as a Comforting Glowing Face,"Michigan, United States",Family / Friends Visits,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Family / Friends Visits :: Grandma Appearing as a Comforting Glowing Face

A bout a month or so after my grandmother passed away, and about 4 or 5 months before my grandfather passed, everyone was going through my grandma's stuff, and giving it to each person in the family. I got her old bed to put in my bedroom as a guest bed. One night, my friend was staying the night, and my sister came into my room, and we had like a little party, there was a thick cover thing on my grandma's bed, that she always had on it, and since my sister and my friend were both going to sleep in my room, I let my sister sleep on my bed, my friend sleep in my grandma's old bed, and I slept on the floor on the thick cover that once belonged to my grandmother. As I started to fall asleep, I was re-awakened by a bright light in my face, so I opened my eyes really quick to see a glowing face that disappeared about a second after I opened my eyes. I realized right away that it was the face of my grandmother.

The next night my friend stayed another night, so my sister slept in my room as well, so once again we slept in all the same places, and this night, I was hoping to see my grandmother again, because when I had seen her the night before, I became overwhelmed with a since of safety, almost as if I knew she was there to make sure nothing bad happened to me.

I had forgotten to take my glasses off that night, and I started to fall asleep, kind of disappointed that I didn't see her, then all of a sudden I saw the bright light again, but this time it seemed a bit dimmer, I'm not sure if it was because I was really tired or what... But my eyes were so heavy that it took me a little while to open my eyes, just before I opened my eyes happily to see my grandmother again, I felt my glasses get pushed back onto my face, because they had been sliding off my face, when I opened my eyes all I saw was her glowing hand moving away from my face.

For the next few months I felt happy, and like nothing could go wrong, because when my grandmother passed away it felt as if a bit of my heart had been torn out, so knowing that she was still there, and keeping me safe made me happy.

About 4 or 5 months later my grandfather passed away, and yes I was sad to know that he was gone, but it also gave me a good feeling to know that he was reunited with my grandmother, he was wanted to pass away because he missed her very much, after he left to go be with her, I haven't seen either of them since.

I believe that when one person of a couple dies, they don't go the the next world yet, they kind of get caught in between worlds until the other person passes away to be with them, then they can both cross over together.

Well thank you for reading this, and feel free to comment, and feel free to tell me your beliefs.

My Aunt's House,"Wisconsin, United States",Poltergeists / Physical Manifestations,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Poltergeists / Physical Manifestations :: My Aunt's House

I had previously posted a story on here but this one I recently remembered. This happened when I was about 9-13... I am 16 now. Me and my cousin Amber had always been very close. She lived in a 2 story house (she's 21 now and moved out when she was 18). I stayed over at her house a lot when she still lived with her parents. The upstairs of that house is freaky, especially Amber's room. I could hear breathing sometimes when I was alone up there and always feeling watched.

One time when I woke up in the middle of the night when I was staying there, I swear I saw someone standing by me (amber was sleeping next to me). Amber had the same experiences and so did everyone else in that house. I was always scared to go up there alone and I still am, but one time I had to go up there to grab some clothes Amber gave me, and as I was walking down the stairs her door slammed! I stared to cry and fell down the rest of the stairs trying to get down stairs as fast as possible (I was the only one upstairs when this happened).

Another time I was alone in the house babysitting Amber's younger brother Hayden, when the ice on the fridge door just started to come out. Then, at about 11pm, I heard the upstairs door slam. Hayden was scared because of all the noise so I called my dad to come pick me and my cousin Hayden up. My aunt and uncle and cousin Hayden still live there but Hayden refuses to go upstairs or sleep in his upstairs bedroom (he's about 9 now), but he never slept up there alone.

As for me, I make sure I'm never alone in that house... Especially upstairs. Did I mention Amber played with an Ouija board upstairs in her room? She told me that after she played with it, she had a dream of a girl that used to live there drowned in the bathtub. And every time she tried to put it away in her closet, the next day it would be on her bedroom floor out of the box and everything.

The Burly Man in my House,"Nebraska, United States",Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: The Burly Man in my House

I have lived in the same house for about 15 years now and ever since I was young, my sister and I have encountered some strange experiences. I will share some that happened to me. The first time I became aware that the spirit was in my house I was 9 or 10. I had a friend over to spend the night and we were in the basement. I went upstairs for a reason I can no longer recall and on my return down the stairs, I fell. It was only about 6 stairs that I actually fell down, but I remember distinctly feeling hands on my back and a forceful push. As I lay at the bottom of the stairs, I looked back up to see if my sister or some had pushed me. I saw a figure, it wasn't exactly opaque nor did it have shape. It just seemed that in this area, the background looked less sharp, blurry. My friend came around the corner to see if I was okay. When I looked back to see the figure, it had disappeared.

The next experience happened a few weeks after being pushed down the stairs. I was home alone, and I went to the garage to get a soda. I walked into the garage and heard a strange noise coming from the attic. I listened carefully and decided that they had to be foot steps because the noise would move about in the attic. Curious I called out ""Hello?"" and then it stop suddenly for about a second. Then in what sounded like a burst of energy (or rage), the noise trampled towards the attic door. I ran back into the house and out the front door and refused to go home until someone else was there.

It wasn't until recently that the being in my house adopted a visual self (or maybe it was the first time I noticed). He is huge, if he were real he'd be 6'6 6'7, and 250 to 300 lbs. His body and face are all the same color, paper white and he has a full head of jet black hair. The first time I noticed him in this form was last summer, I came home from a late night of partying. While I fumbled with my keys to let myself in, something huge and white came and stood right in front of the door on the inside of the house, so I could see him in the sidelight windows. I screamed! I told him to leave me alone, and he slide off the opposite way he came. I rushed in my house and locked my bedroom door (like it would do some good).

He really likes to mess with people, especially me. He likes to steal things and move them. He really likes to inhabit electronics. One night, I had some friends over to the house and we were in the basement. We kept hearing loud thuds upstairs. I was a little scared, but I assumed that it was just a cat, only all the cats were out. I asked my friend Cody to please come investigate with me and he agreed. We went to the first floor and found nothing strange, so we proceeded to the second floor. We heard an alarm clock going off in my parent's room (it was around 9 at night, no reason for an alarm to have been set). What makes it really weird is that it was my mom's clock and it was doing the alarm beeps, but my mom only wakes up to the radio and her clock it set for that. We both thought it was really odd. I turned it off and went back to the basement. Later, after my friends had left, I was cleaning on the first floor, and out of the corner of my eyes, I saw him move across the hallway and he went through the door and out into the garage. I notice that on the closet door in the hallway, there was a coat hanger, and it was swing wildly. I called my friends and had them pick me up.

There has been many more experiences in my house, and I'm still not sure if the man is evil and there to hurt me or if he just likes to play jokes and scare me. Either way I ask him on a regular basis to leave me alone, sometimes it works, sometimes not...

Ghostly Resort,"California, United States",Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: Ghostly Resort

I worked on this resort as an operations manager and as a security supervisor from 05/03 to 06/05 . In this period I, and many other employees, encountered many strange happenings such as... Lights being turned off just to be turned on again. The sounds of a party in progress in a suite and just as we open the door it all stops, receiving phone calls from rooms that are supposed to be empty, the silhouette of a person's body on a bed in a room that is supposed to be empty. In the outer health club, you can hear someone on the second floor moving things , when you go to check on it there's no one there. This noise is constant as soon as you leave the floor the noise starts up again.

The management has no comment on the situation we have had three mediums visit us to explain what the problem is. During the buildings construction, two construction workers died. One in the spa and one at the health club. Ever since, the situation started.

If anyone is interested in visiting this beautiful property ask for Fred, he is in security and would be very happy to comment on this case. He has been working there since construction began on this property.

The Woman from the 1800s,"Tennessee, United States",Apparitions / Voices / Touches,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Apparitions / Voices / Touches :: The Woman from the 1800s

I have experienced a lot of paranormal activities, but this one happened to me the other day and I thought I would share it with you guys. Me and my friend were just wanting something to do and since we like ghosts, he suggested we just walk through the cemetery. I have been there numerous times and have never witnessed anything unusual. As we were walking, I started hearing this low woman voice in my head, so I immediately stopped walking. My friend was saying ""what's wrong"" but I was trying to listen to the woman. She said her name was georgia and she had died in the 1860s and that her grave was on the other side of the cemetery. After that the voices stopped. Then I told him what was going on we looked for the grave until I came upon a plaque in the ground. We tried to dust it off and make out the letters and it said Georgia Ann born 1821, died in 1860, we were so scared, after that we left.

I don't know why she tried to contact me . If you guys could give me any info on what or why you think she could have wanted, please email me or leave a comment thanks.

The Car,"Ohio, United States",Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: The Car

W hen I was only eight years old, I saw my first ghost. I lived in a city in southern Ohio. Across the alley from the back of our house was an old shed. It seemed to be used for storage of the abandoned old house in front of it. Curious children wanted to know what was in there. My sister, two years older than I, and a neighbor boy of about the same age, and myself decided to check out the contents of this shed. We had entered it several times. Nosing through old boxes of books and dishes. Just normal storage stuff, other than the small bed in the corner which had linens and blankets. Also there was an old car with step sides and a wind shield that cranked out. We thought it strange that sometimes the bed would be made neatly and other times it would be as though someone had slept there. We thought maybe someone else was sneaking in here also.

Then the day came when my sister and I decided to step up on the side step of the car and look in. There in the back seat, we both saw a lady lying across the entire seat. Quickly we got down from the step side. We hesitated but did peak one more time to see if the lady was still there. She was not. We told our mother and she replied ""it's only your imagination"". I've never been convinced of that since my sister and I both saw this at the same time.

Twenty years later, I ask my sister if she remembered the car in the building, and she replied ""yes and the lady in it"".

Ms. Unknown,"Massachusetts, United States",Old Hags / Night Attacks / Sleep Paralysis,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Old Hags / Night Attacks / Sleep Paralysis :: Ms. Unknown

I 'm only eleven and have already encountered a ghost. I go to my grandmother's house a lot and see ""things"". There used to be this rocking chair in the living room that every time at 2am, something would be rocking this chair. My grand mother is very religious and she can tell (by the coldness) when a ghost is near.

My favorite cousin, Annabell, and I, snuck out at almost 1:30 am to the living room we waited to see, but we never saw anything. Annabell got so tired, she went to bed. I stood there awake, forcing myself to stay awake (I'm fascinated by ghosts. Every day I come home, I go read the ghost stories on the computer, I would do any thing to see a real ghost). At 2:00am, I nearly got sat on. I thought it was my sister (she wakes up every night to go pee) but it was a lot heavier. I couldn't breath. When the weight decreased, I jumped up to see who it was. All I saw was a figure, it looked like a young woman.

The next morning I told Annabell about my encounter. She thought I was lying because she said I was a great actress. That was until my other cousin told me about a women who died in that house and owned that rocking chair. That cousin encountered the same ghost but it was when she went to brush her teeth and the ghost came through her bathroom door. As soon as she screamed, my grand mother came rushing I'll never forget that day, 5/30/03.

The Sandra Wooding-Limon Story: A Story of a Haunting in Bakersfield,"California, United States",Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: The Sandra Wooding-Limon Story: A Story of a Haunting in Bakersfield

A s I sit here pondering if there is life after death. I can only assume, there must be an afterlife. Einstein came up with the sound theory that E = MC2. Energy can be converted into matter and matter can be converted into energy. Energy is a substance that cannot be destroyed. All information from energy is sustained for eternity. On one web site, called ""Ask a Rocket Scientist"", I asked if Earth were to be sucked up into a black hole, would that mean that all information on the existence of mankind would be destroyed? The history of Earth would be gone? The answer from the rocket scientist was 'no'. Due to the fact that energy cannot be destroyed, it can be altered, but not destroyed. So all of the tidbits of a scathing email that you wanted to send to your boss, you deleted it from your computer, but it still exists in the vastness of cyberspace. On the quantum level we are all energy creatures. Break us down to atoms and on the quantum level I would be able to place my hand right through your body and out again. Henceforth, in Star Trek we see the scattering of our atoms through a teleporter and reappear again intact with Capt. Kirk ready for battle. So, if our matter bodies have intelligence, then why can't a pure energy being have intelligence? Why couldn't the aura that surrounds our body consume the intelligence that our physical corporal body has? When we die, the aura leaves our body. The aura is our soul. A soul that may decide to follow the light into the next realm. An energy realm, we may call it heaven, we may call it hell. Or a soul that refuses to go into the light and remains on Earth, with unfinished business to attend to. We call this a haunting.

As a writer, I am a conduit for people to tell their stories. I listen, I make the decision that a story will become immortalized through my writings. On a particular night at Cache Creek Casino, at Club 88, a woman by the name of Sandra Wooding-Limon asked for me to write a story of a haunting that happened to her. A haunting that she can't get out of her mind. As we talked during the music that the band Masterpiece was playing, songs like ""Body Talk by The Deele"", ""Chase Me by Confunkshun"" and ""Good Times by Chic..."" She was familiar with my paranormal investigations via H.P.I. (Haunted and Paranormal Investigations) of Northern California. This is the story she relates to me:

At the age of 7, she lived in a home in Bakersfield, California, off a street called Bel Torres. Her home was situated across the street from the neighborhood park. The home was not elaborate like the Amityville Horror home, it was a simple 3 bedroom house. There she lived with her brothers and sisters, her mother and stepfather. When she first moved into this home, she was automatically scared of this house. When she moved in, she felt this eerie feeling. Night after night, she felt a presence as she tried to sleep in her bed. She felt someone was standing over her bedside. As the hauntings continued, her bed covers would be thrown off of her. This was too much for a little Sandra, she insisted to have a night light on. She had a harder time falling asleep. She would be afraid to sleep. She would see shadows walking near the hallway and across her bedroom. The entity or entities seemed focus on her. While she felt the hauntings, her sister, age 6 was not disturbed and would sleep soundly, while all the while she was being terrified by this unseen force. When the TV was on, the walking shadows seemed to make their presence known even more. The doors would move on their own accord and the cabinets would open and close on their own. One night, she turned around and the rocking chair kept rocking on its own. This was too much for Sandra. Her family knew that Sandra was going through these traumatic disturbances and after one year, the family decided to move away. Sandra was absolutely terrified and it didn't help when she also heard on the news that the Zodiac was at large. At this young tender age, she was terrified of a hooded serial killer that was stalking his prey, that prey was 'people' and the ghosts that were in this Bakersfield home. Sandra is now an adult woman, but thoughts and memories of this home still haunt her to this very day.

She will never forget a particular storm that came into Bakersfield and during that night the hauntings came on very strong, her bed covers were taken off of her, the shadows on the walls were everywhere and the cabinets kept slamming open and shut during the storm. Not too long after the storm is when her family decided enough was enough. It was time to move. After having this experience and moving away from the house in Bakersfield, she was terrified to go to her grandfather's house. She didn't know if the house was haunted, but it seemed to be haunted. Her grandmother died in the house and her grandfather would have a shrine that included lit candles and many patron Catholic saints near and around the lit candles. This in itself was spooky. She related to me that her grandfather always kept the house dark, she would hear things move around in the house, when there was no one there. Her aunt lived in her grandfather's house. Her aunt was strange, she was into the gothic lifestyle and had black lights, psychedelic paraphernalia in her dark bedroom. Sandra now strives to seek out the positive, she likes a lot of lights, she avoids the darkness. This childhood experience has effected her life to this very day.

Sandra due to the nightmares of her childhood experiences once consulted with a now defunct paranormal group called S.P.I.T. (Stockton Paranormal Investigation Team), but didn't feel satisfied with their counseling. She feels if her story is told, it may eliminate the inner demons of her traumatic childhood experience. Good luck Sandra, your story is now told.

As I close this story, I only wonder if spirits may use the writings of others as their conduit to tell their story. Once in Rolling Stone Magazine, there was an article on the fact that Jim Morrison of the Doors had appeared to many people after his death. Well, this story wouldn't have phased me, except for the fact that my first wife Karen Jean Walker/Caruso had related to me that she sat on a couch with Jim Morrison. Jim told her to accept life and embrace it. Of course this was the spirit of Jim Morrison, because Jim Morrison had died years ago. When Karen told me this story I laughed. When I read the Rolling Stone article, I almost fell out of my chair. Could Karen be telling the truth? In 1999, I had a dream that I saw my mother, who died in 1987. In this dream, my mother had a strange looking man sitting behind her with glasses and a brief case. My mother told me to tell the story of my father's connection to Mickey Cohen, a well known gangster with ties to Bugsy Siegel. Behind her the man standing behind her said: ""Please tell the story..."" I never told the story, until now. My father a former tax investigator opened up a case that was pending since the 1950s. The reason it was pending is that the government accountant investigating the case was killed by the mob for trying to collect on State taxes. My father who just handled a case in collecting State taxes from the Church of Scientology, that also owed federal taxes to the IRS, took the challenge of reopening this case. When meeting the mob in Los Angeles via a corporation that they owned, the mobsters took my father out to dinner and wrote him a check. It was an easy collection of State taxes owed, but a government accountant in the 50s lost his life over this matter. Perhaps the deceased accountant didn't want his life to be forgotten and consulted my mother to tell his story? I don't know. I don't know if my over active mind created this appearance of my mother and the strange man behind her. Was that strange man behind her the accountant? Then why didn't he tell me his name? Or does he feel confident that anyone looking into this story, will discover his name and complete the history of his encounter with the mob. Perhaps I am the conduit for living people and deceased people to tell their unfinished stories. I am here. I am listening.

Cigarette Fumble,"Michigan, United States",Family / Friends Visits,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Family / Friends Visits :: Cigarette Fumble

D uring the time between my grandmother's passing and my grandfather's passing, whenever I would smoke a cigarette, the cigarette would start to shake as if someone were trying to push it out of my hand, my grandmother never liked the fact that my dad smoked, and I think it may have been her way of telling me not to smoke, even to this day (well over a year since my grandfather's passing). Sometimes when I am smoking, my cigarette seems to be snatched from me hand and dropped.

I'm not sure if it my grandparents telling me not to smoke, or if it is all in my head, and me thinking that it is them. Well tell me what you think. I would love to talk to my grandparents, but I really don't like using ouija boards, because of something that happened to me about 4 or 5 years ago.

Thank you for reading, and I might be giving updates, and I will soon be posting my past events with the ouija board.

Demon in the Sky,"Indiana, United States",Ouija Board / Seances,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Ouija Board / Seances :: Demon in the Sky

O n Oct 31st, 2004, on Halloween, me and my friends (josh, ryan, and jacob) decided to go out at midnight to play the ouija board on an upside down pentagram. So late that night, we all snuck out and met up at the park entrance. It was a full moon out so we didn't need candles or anything. We sat the board on top of the pentagram and in less than a second, without any of us asking it any thing, it spelled out ""i can see you"". So as stupid as we were, we would make fun of him (calling him name, provoking him, things like that).

It continued on ""I can see you, I can see you, I can see you..."" Then all the sudden it stopped. We went kind of slow and the ouija board spelled out ""stand up and look at me"". So taking this as a joke to scare us, we stood up to take a look. When we did, not to far in the distance, stood a kind of tall man in the shadows but you could still make him out (not like any ghost I have ever seen). But I yelled ""HELLO... HELLOOO..."" but no answer, then he was gone faster than i can blink my eyes! Right after that, we all started to try and apologize.

It was no use, we had messed around with something we didn't know. Now it was his turn. This demon was now spelling out ""look up"", when we did, the moon blanked out for a split second as if something just flew over it. We were flipping out! Josh and Jacob screaming ""What the f*ck!"". I grabbed my ouija board and I was like ""let's get the hell out of here!"" Just then, something swooped down and hit a very very very near tree. When it hit, leaves were falling and a few small limbs. I don't think I have ever ran that fast in my life! We got back to my house as fast as we could and spent the rest of the night looking up.

I was 13 then and I'm 17 now, that story still makes me say ""no frickin way!"". I know how weird it sounds but this really happened to me and my friends. They still play around with the ouija board and still pisses it off but we will always remember that one night.

My Old Father is Seeing Ghosts,"Massachusetts, United States",Psychic / Medium,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Psychic / Medium :: My Old Father is Seeing Ghosts

L ooking for someone who may have experience with something like this. My father is 80 years old and has started seeing multiple ghosts in his apartment. When he goes to my sister's house, he sees different ghosts there. But always the same ones. Obviously everyone thinks he is crazy but I don't believe he is.

My father had a full physical, brain scan, testing for strokes etc. Etc. All came back normal. He is old but in great shape. He is very specific about what they look like. Even down to hair color and color of shirts and coats they wear. He said they very rarely will look at him. They do not look him in the eyes. They never talk. They will just walk around and sit on the couch, etc.

He said when he throws holy water around the room - they disappear. Today he told me he yelled at one and told it to leave and it ran past him and he said he felt the breeze as if someone had moved past him. It is very sad to listen to him. He keeps saying he is not crazy. He really sees them. He doesn't know what to do and is very scared. No one believes him and keep saying he needs to see a psychiatrist.

Evil Presence,"Washington, United States",Demons / Possessions / Exorcisms,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Demons / Possessions / Exorcisms :: Evil Presence

I 'm am 16 years old and I live in algona, washington. I recently moved into an apartment with my dad, my sister and my brother. My sister and I share a bedroom. One night, my sister told me that she knows how to contact the dead. I was a little freaked out, but I wanted to try it. I said that we should contact our great grandma who died in 2001. So we did, we began asking her questions, like ""are you at peace, are you disappointed in us, are you in heaven, are you happy"". The only positive answer was she's not disappointed. She was not at peace, not in heaven, and not happy, she's stuck on earth. We felt like she was there to protect out  our family.

Since I moved in, I have felt a presence, not a good one, I am always on edge and I always feel like I'm being watched. My sister said she felt like our grandma wanted us to break the chain (we were holding hands), she looked very scared, so we did. We felt like there was something evil in out room. We sat with the lights on for about and hour before deciding to go to bed. We turned out the lights and soon felt the presence again, only, it felt more evil. We sat with our eyes closed, we did not want to see it. But I did anyway, I had a vision in my head of a tall dark menacing figure standing near my bed, staring at us. I asked her to turn on the light and she said no, she felt like it was a demon. Spirits can't do anything to you but demons can. We began to say the lord's prayer and pray in tongues. The presence went away and we turned on the lights.

I still feel it, not as prominently as that night, but its still there.

Queen Mary Paranormal Tour,"California, United States",Ghost Tours & Haunted Hotels,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Ghost Tours & Haunted Hotels :: Queen Mary Paranormal Tour

I n October 2006, my 9 year-old son and I accompanied my good friend Chris to Los Angeles to pick up a travel visa for his upcoming trip abroad. Since the visit in the office was very short, we had extra time to kill before heading back home (a couple of hours away). We decided to do something fun, so using his cool GPS system in his rental car, we looked up attractions in the area and saw the Long Beach Aquarium and agreed to go there.

As soon as we were in sight of the aquarium, I changed my mind about going there as soon as I saw the Queen Mary just across the water. It was a magnificent sight! I had seen a documentary about the Queen Mary on television which chronicled its ghostly history. It didn't take much to talk Chris into changing direction and at least stopping by for a quick tour. My son was a little terrified to go there as soon as I mentioned it being haunted, but he would prove to be a good sport on our trip.

We parked and headed into the Queen Mary, it was the first ship of that size that I had ever been on. The Queen Mary was not just a tourist stop, but also a hotel. We ventured into the lobby and saw a schedule of events. We were there on a Thursday, which was one of three days of the week that offers a ""Paranormal Ship Walk Tour"". We got there a little after 4 p.m. And the tour wouldn't start until 8 p.m. On a whim, we decided to spend the night there at the Queen Mary and buy tickets to the tour (they were $50 a pop, but well worth the cost!). It was a highly detailed tour which lasted a little over two hours.

We went to do a little shopping in Long Beach (as we were so totally unprepared for an overnight stay) and grab some dinner at Bubba Gump Shrimp Factory. We came back at about half past 7 pm, checked into our room and waited in the lobby for our host, rather a ""paranormal host"" by the name of Erika Frost.

She was a petite and pretty lady. She'd been a psychic since a near death experience when she was younger. Since then, she says she's had the ability to communicate with spirits.

There were about 15 people in our group, including Ms. Frost and her two assistants. My son was the youngest in the group, there were two teenagers, and the rest of us were adults. We each received a flashlight and a compass to carry with us during the tour. Luckily for me, I happened to bring my digital camera. We started the tour with my son glued to my hip.

In one of the first rooms we entered, I had a scene flash in my mind. In this room, I saw a lot of tables, like a cafeteria. When the scene passed and I was able to take a good look at the room, it was dark and dusty and crammed with old furniture, it was essentially a large storage room. Within a few moments, Ms. Frost explained that the room had been a lunch room long ago. Wow! How about that? A small chill ran up my back, this was going to an awesome tour, I could already tell!

A few minutes later we entered a larger room. It was in this room that you could hear voices saying ""HELP ME!"" You had to really pay attention to hear it. The voices sounded almost mechanical and it was difficult to tell where they were coming from. It was kind of creepy, but it didn't make me get chills or anything. Ms. Frost said that some tours are really dull with inactivity, but she said that this night was especially noisy because we could all hear the voices in any place we stood in that large room.

A while later, we entered the 1st class swimming pool area, the ""hottest"" place on the ship as far as ghostly activity was concerned. If I remember correctly, young woman was killed in the swimming locker room (which is considered to be a vortex to another dimension or something). The other story I more vividly remember is of a little girl named Jackie who actually drowned in the 2nd class swimming pool, but prefers to haunt the 1st class pool instead. Smart kid!

By the way, there is a ghost cam that is on 24/7 in the swimming pool area. On occasion from my home computer, I can see strange shadows lurking on the cam.

It is in the 1st class swimming pool area that the meat of my story lies. Now, before I tell you, I have to say that if Agent Scully and Agent Mulder had a daughter, then it would probably be me. I love to believe in the paranormal, but I tend to find rational explanations for the unknown because I like to believe that I'm a fairly level headed person. Now, on with my story. Ms. Foster brought along a couple of divining rods, like what someone would use to search for underground water. She asked for a volunteer and no one offered. Oh what the heck! So I stepped up. I had no idea what she was going to do until after I had taken the divining rods from her. She showed me how to hold the rods on my hands and I stood there for her instructions. She told the group that she was going to call Jackie, who was a very playful spirit. Oh boy, I didn't expect this! But, I thought I'd be a good sport and play along. Everyone was quiet (even my son, which was so unlike him, ha ha ha).

I held on to the rods and waited for something to happen as Ms. Foster called out to Jackie. Nothing was happening. I must have held those rods for a good couple of minutes before I felt a tingle. It was just a slight tingle and it made the divining rods turn slightly but, then it went away. Ms. Foster was going to end the session and move to another room when my son started calling Jackie. He was really excited, he really wanted something to happen. Just then, after he'd enthusiastically called out to Jackie several times the tingle sensation came back. The sensation began to envelope me. It didn't start in any one particular location, I felt it in my feet, in my stomach, in my head. It was like butterflies fluttering in my body, it was like a gush of warm wind, it was like a blob of energy, it was breathtaking, it was like being lifted in the air. It was the oddest thing I've ever felt. I tried to keep calm in front of everyone, but couldn't help gasp a time or two in complete amazement. I was so involved in this experience that I didn't realize that I had closed my eyes. I opened them and saw the divining rods spinning around my hand. I kept my hands as calm as they could be considering the momentum that was building within me. The experience must have lasted only a couple of minutes, once it began to subside, the divining rods slowed and eventually stopped. Ms. Foster and the group were really surprised at what had happened. Chris was pretty concerned at my reaction, he kept asking me if I was OK. Ms. Foster had said that not too many people were open enough to have this happen to them. My son was so excited, he was just having fun with it all. I really can't explain what that sensation could have been (I believe in Jinns, not ghosts/spirits of dead people), but I wasn't scared at all. What I felt was in no way evil.

Just before we finished the tour, we had another session with the divining rods at another hot spot. I seemed to have added the much needed spice to our tour, because this time there were several volunteers. Unfortunately, the divining rods didn't really move for anyone else. However, all of our compasses were acting crazy.

I took many pictures during the tour, and I noticed a good number of ORBS in them. I would take one picture twice, one right after the other and notice that the first had no ORBS, and the second one had ORBS. This was really interesting to see and I freaked out a lot of my friends when I showed them the pictures. However, I have read that a rational explanation for ORBS, that they are just dust particles that have a reflection on them, via the flash of the camera. Hmmm.

Last by not least, after the tour we retired to our room. As Chris was kind enough to go fetch a pail of ice for me, my son and I said our prayers together in our bed in the corner of the room. A minute or two into our prayers, we heard a loud bang on the inside of the closet. The closet was one of those large bureaus the laid against the wall. The sound was so loud that I expected the closet doors to fly open. It scared the snot out of us and definitely interrupted our prayers. My son let out a slight gasp and I told him to continue with the prayer. We did, and only a few seconds later we heard another crash that sounded like someone throwing an object on top of the dresser filled with small ceramic objects. The top of the dresser was actually empty of anything that could have made all that racket, in fact, I had laid our clothes, neatly folded, on it. The dresser was in the other corner of the room near the foot of our bed. Nothing that we could see could have made that noise in that location. I seriously doubt that we had thin walls and were just hearing our neighbors. We finished our prayers and a few minutes later Chris came back. The rest of the night was uneventful, although I had a dream that Jackie was calling me to play with her. The next morning, I took some pictures of our room. There was an ORB floating above the head of the bed that my son and I slept on.

Huge Black Figure,"Washington, United States",Apparitions / Voices / Touches,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Apparitions / Voices / Touches :: Huge Black Figure

I am 23 now, this occurred when I was 16. I lived at my parents house, about 12 miles or so from where I live now. From the time I was a child until now, I always read myself to sleep. This night was no exception. I had been reading by lava lamp (since its a dim light that makes it easy to fall asleep). When I was reading, the TV was on in the living room, and lights were on around 11: 00 pm. I fell asleep, as usual, with a book and my lamp still on. Now, at this time my bedroom door was broken and a brick was in front of it so that if someone walked by it wouldn't blow open. This is important.

What must have been a few hours later, I was woken up to the sound of my door opening. The brick made a swooshing noise across the carpet. I opened my eyes just enough to see who was there and at first, seeing as how I was totally asleep, I couldn't understand who I was staring at. However, there was a dark figure in my doorway. I noticed that the house was completely dark and quiet, so my entire family must have gone to bed. As well, it must have been very late because my parents wouldn't turn off the TV and go to bed until after waking up very late and realizing they should go up to bed.

Remember, my lava lamp was on because I had fallen asleep with it on and my book was on my lap. However, the figure was completely black. My lava lamp illuminated my entire room and if standing in the doorway, the front of the person should have been completely visible. Also, behind the person in the ceiling is a skylight, so the back was lit up as well. The figure was still totally black, blacker than anything else in the house.

He was huge. It was a standard size doorway but he reached up the full height and filled the entire frame. Much larger than my father or brother. His hand was on the doorknob and he was breathing very hard as though he was very angry or totally out of breath. I could hear him breathing, and he appeared to be staring at me.

Now, I know I wasn't asleep. I had come full awake at this time and though I wasn't at all paralyzed, I didn't move. I am aware of my consciousness because my arm was off the side of the bed and cold from the air from being there probably since I fell asleep. I was also doing a trick so that I could see without anyone realizing I am awake (a way of looking out your lashes, it was engrained in me since I have an older brother who used to sneak in my room and take things when I was asleep...)

For some reason I wasn't scared at all, just completely calm as if there was no reason to feel anything about him. I fell back asleep with him still standing there, breathing hard, and didn't wake up again until morning.

When I woke up I instantly thought about him - now this couldn't have been a dream because on average people have 6 - 8 dreams a night, if this were very late and I woke up when it was light out, I would have had another dream about forgotten about that one by time I woke up.

Now, the scary part that really cemented the fact that it was not a dream, was that when I got out of bed to go into the rest of the house my door was closed, but the brick was pushed back as though the door was opened, and then closed again.

My parents mentioned nothing of a door being unlocked, or a window open, and if someone like that had broken into the house, and come into my room, they would have never simply looked at me and left...

Anyway, it's not the only experience at my house. All my childhood I heard a voice with no gender call myself or my mother. My mother has seen and felt my uncle that died when I was a child, etc... But this was the only time I looked straight at any type of ghost or spirit in the house.

My Own Poltergeist,"Colorado, United States",Poltergeists / Physical Manifestations,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Poltergeists / Physical Manifestations :: My Own Poltergeist

T his experience is not for the ones who are scared of ghosts. I was a teen, and my mom and I got into an argument. I told her not to close my door and turn out the light. She does it anyways. I am sitting under my blanket, and all of a sudden, it flies off of me. I pull it back on, and something hits my face. My little brother, 12 at the time, came in and asked me if I was ok. I was screaming. He took a look at my face. The right side was a maroon hand print, twice the size of mine. He got my mom. She said to cut out the crap. The next day in my algebra class, I was set up against the wall in my desk. I felt something breathing on my neck. I looked above me, and the air vent was on the other side of the room. That night, I fell asleep.

At 1:00 am, I woke up feeling very cold. I opened my eyes, and could see my breath. Next thing I knew, my favorite stuffed animal was grabbed out of my arms. I started crying. Next thing I knew, my arms were being scratched by a fork. How the fork got up there I don't know. I wore a jacket to color guard next day, and the scratches that bled profusely the night before went away, no trace of scabs.

The next night, I was sleeping, and at the same time the night before, I felt cold. Again I could see my breath. I looked next to me, and saw a long imprint in my bed. I put the blanket over my head, and it flew off. Then, my ""figure"" started to flip my hair. I checked out a lot of books, and they were all coincidental to me. For example, poltergeists usually revolve around one person. Second, they usually occur between the age of 10-20. Lastly, the person it occurs to is usually either sad or angry. I was both...

Encounter at the Lake,"California, United States",Orbs / Lights / Mists,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Orbs / Lights / Mists :: Encounter at the Lake

T his story happened to my friend Ted, about 30 years ago, when he was young, probably between 10 and 13 years old. His parents had a second home by Lake Isabella that was located in a mobile home park near the water. Lake Isabella is a quaint little town that is surrounded by wilderness and that is famous (well, at least in our region it's famous) for its man-made lake. They would visit once or twice a month just for the weekends, so the rest of the time it was uninhabited, or so they thought. His parents had gone to visit some friends a few doors down and Ted decided to stay home alone and watch TV. While he was lying down on the couch and relaxing, he turned his head and noticed an odd glow in his parent's bedroom down the dark hall. He said it was as though the entire bed was glowing. He didn't know what it was, but in a stupid act of bravery, he yelled ""Whatever you are! Get the hell out of our house!"" He never saw what it was, but felt it coming after him down the hall in a sudden jolt. He was lifted off the couch and thrown behind the couch, hitting the wall hard and then landing on the floor. He stayed frozen for a moment, then got back on the couch and covered himself with the blanket and waited for his parents to get home. He never experienced this again.

My explanation to him is that it could have been a Jinn that inhabited the home because they were gone so much.

Guardian Angel or Menacing Apparition?,South Africa,Apparitions / Voices / Touches,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Apparitions / Voices / Touches :: Guardian Angel or Menacing Apparition?

L ate in 2001, my wife was at home taking care of our 8 month old baby girl. She laid the sleeping baby in her baby cot, pulled up the side safety bars and locked it into place, and then proceeded to the kitchen to continue with her day's chores. Several minutes later, she walked back to the bedroom, to check on our little girl. She was totally surprised to find the child on the floor, several meters away from the baby-cot. Upon inspection she discovered that the safety bar was still locked and in place, the baby was fine and seemed to be busy playing. We have never been able to explain how our daughter was removed from the baby-cot and placed on the bedroom floor, without so much as the slightest sound being heard. I wish to add that all doors were locked at the time, and our two little poodles make it practically impossible for an intruder to enter undetected.

A few days later, I had the house slightly modified by removing the wall between the main house and the adjoining cottage, this allowed us an extra bathroom, kitchen and bedroom. Prior to this, we had never used the cottage as the main house already had three bedrooms. That evening, I was standing in the passage way of the main house looking down into the cottage, through the opening we had just created. My wife was in the cottage bedroom chatting to her mum. It suddenly caught my attention that another person was standing near the doorway, almost leaning against the door frame. Somehow I was not afraid at all, I briefly looked at the figure, noticed that it was that of an older man, with facial hair, like a beard. He was very tall and did not move at all. In fact it seemed as if he was looking into the room where my wife and her mum were, and paying attention to the conversation. I knew then that I was looking at an apparition.

I gathered all my courage, and boldly moved forward, passing within a few centimeters of the figure. As I stepped through the doorway, I felt a chill in the air. A few more steps, and I was standing beside my wife, I turned to face the figure and it was gone. I then explained what had just occurred an of course, everyone was a little tense for the next few days. We have since moved from that house.

My questions are, Could this ghostly person be responsible for removing our daughter from her baby-cot and placing her on the floor? Who does this spirit belong to? I have encountered such apparitions on a few other occasions thereafter. I may post my experiences on this site at a later date. We have also discovered that my daughter, who is now six years old, has some sort of a guardian angel. She is extremely successful in all that she does, and tells us quite often of incidents that are still to come. She even seems to know that she will receive a gift, or a toy before we have even decided to buy it.

I hope my experiences makes for good reading, and if any of you readers have explanations, I would appreciate your input.

Pap Pays a Visit,"Pennsylvania, United States",Family / Friends Visits,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Family / Friends Visits :: Pap Pays a Visit

T his story is about my grandfather's ghost. A week ago, on Easter after dinner, my mother, myself, and her friend Lisa began discussing ghosts. My mother said that about four years ago, around the anniversary of my grandfather's death, she began to see things. She saw a figure with no face, wearing tan khaki shirt and pants on two different occasions. The first time, she was walking down the hallway in our house and saw the figure, standing in our living room which is never even used. Then the second time, she was walking down the hallway toward the garage to throw a soda can out, proceeded to reach for the door and saw the figure again. The same thing, no face but wearing tan khaki's. She said to herself ""I know I saw something there"".

She then told her brother, my uncle Bob, about it and he said to her ""oh that's Dad"". She looked at him and said that ""he didn't wear khaki's and he was only in the army briefly"". He said ""yeah but what did he wear to work everyday? Tan khaki's with PP&L written on the shirt"". My grandfather worked for PP&L (Pennsylvania Power and Light) and retired in 1976. He always went to work wearing tan khaki's.

Then, not long after this happened, my mother had another experience. She said she was standing at the kitchen sink, when suddenly she felt a hand on her back. My stepfather used to come up behind her and scare her. So thinking it was him said ""ok ok I'm getting supper ready"". However, she turns around to see my stepfather coming through the back door from outside. He looked at her and said ""Jesus Christ you look like you saw a ghost"".

I hope that if and when my grandfather comes back to visit I hope I'll be able to see him like my mother did.

My 7 Year Old Son Lives With Multiple Ghosts,"Michigan, United States",Children Who See Spirits,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Children Who See Spirits :: My 7 Year Old Son Lives With Multiple Ghosts

I need help with this as much as I want to share our stories. There are so many to share so I will try to put it all together the best I can. My husband and I built our house 7 years ago on land that my husband grew up on (farm land - no known war, no tragic past, boring farm land). Nothing special or tragic about the land, a brand new house BUT full of antiques... I always assumed my youngest son could see ""stuff"" but knew that he would eventually lose the ability as did my older son. Well, it is only getting worse as he gets older.

He is seven years old and he sees numerous ghosts in our house. He sees ghosts in colors, most of the children are blue see through. Some are gray, some are black with no faces, most scare him horribly. A very few are ""just like us"". He sees them everywhere he goes, in the yard, at the grocery store, today he saw a young boy ghost at the hockey rink (I need help with the color aspect of this, has anyone saw this or heard of this?).

There is one particular ghost in our house that remains in the upstairs bedrooms that scares him so much he cries. This is a tall, bald older man and ""is not nice"". This one almost mocks him or messes with him at bedtime. We just had to move his bedroom because he refused to sleep in his old room. Many nights he would cry because the ghosts would ""get in his face"" while he would try to go to sleep, he would try to hide under the covers but some of them would get under there with him.

He sleeps many nights in our bed, but the other night, while lying in our bed, he said ""Dad do you see that man at your door?"" My husband said ""no"" so my son looked at me and said ""There's a guy at your door..."" The look on his face was of sheer terror. He says they come in my room also, but that he feels more safe in there with me and his dad.

There were times when I thought he was going on about it too much, to get our attention until one day he came home from a friend's house and said his friend didn't believe in ghosts. I thought ""oh no, he is telling everyone"" so I told him a lot of people don't believe and that's ok, we all have our own opinions, some people are too scared to admit it also. He looked at me and said ""Mom, it was just a cat..."" So apparently he sees animals too.

He sees a little girl that will play a hide and seek type game with him around his bedroom door. In his old room he said there were three guys that would come threw his wall he said ""they look like vampires. There aren't vampires but they are trying to scare me like vampires..."" He said that a lot of times they don't want him to see them. He thinks the little girls are laughing at him. When he can't see anyone he can hear them. He has told me that he will not sleep in his old room anymore, ""there are too many people in there...""

One day he went to his old bedroom to play his guitar, he came running down the stairs crying saying that someone spit on him in his room. He said he couldn't see this one, but that his arm was wet and he was scared too death. He said sometimes he can't se them, but he can feel them. That was the last time he went into that room, besides when we moved his stuff out.

His new room has a different ""air"" about it. It feels different; better. We thought for the first time we would get some sleep. WRONG. He agreed that he loved his new room, he thought it felt better, he loved it. I was refilling his bookshelves with his books, he was sitting on the floor next to me, starring out the doorway into the hallway. He said, ""There is a ghost in the hall looking at us..."" I said ""girl or boy?"" he replied ""boy"" I said, ""young or old?"" he said ""Young - teenager, what is that thing that Harley wears around his neck?"" Harley is my sisters dog. I said ""a bandana?"" He said ""Yeah, this kid has one around his neck, it's red. He looks like a cowboy..."" He continued to talk about it and eventually cowboy went away.

So that night, it was bedtime, the new bedroom looked great and felt wonderfully cozy. We all did our goodnights, hugs and kisses and he was left to his room snuggled in with all the stuffed animals. I was in bed for about 10 minutes when my son came in, tears streaming down his cheeks, crying he said ""I am not sleeping in that room..."" I sat up and said ""WHY?"" He said, ""My bed is shaking. It is SHAKING, it is getting faster and faster..."" Of course, I jumped out of bed, ran in there and tried to figure out what was going on. I gave him the explanation of maybe I didn't get the legs to his bed on tight enough so it was shaking when he moved. He accepted that and went to sleep.

I was very eager to hear his stories at breakfast time the next morning, he said he slept great, he only had two ghosts in his room. One was the old bald guy that mocks him and messes with him, my son has a spider man web that hangs from the ceiling, this particular ""guy"" gets in the net and puts his face through the holes and stares at me son. The other ghost was behind his book shelf. Now in this room, it used to be a spare room that actually has a hole in the drywall behind the BOOKSHELF. The ghost behind the bookshelf was new to him...

We have a history of ghost stories for many years from our old house to our new house. No real experiences with us seeing them, but things have disappeared, I myself have ""felt"" them, lights going on and off, creaks in the floor when no one was there. My oldest son actually had imaginary friends at our old house and could tell me about the owner of our previous house that had died in a motorcycle accident. My son was three at the time and we didn't know the owner. We later learned from some neighbors that my son's stories were accurate down to the owners name. My oldest son does not believe now. We have always learned to live with it, but with my youngest son, it is tormenting him, these ghosts are ruining his little childhood and I need help on how to help him. My son told me today, ""Mom, I think they are trying to tell me stuff but I don't know what..."" I agree...

It reminds me of the movie The Sixth Sense, without the gore. But all the fright.

He changed his clothes after his shower today in our downstairs bathroom, he showered upstairs but refused to get clothes on up there because the bald guy was in the bathroom with him, he knew the bald guy wouldn't come downstairs, so he got dressed downstairs. He said while he was brushing his teeth, the bald guy was standing in the bathtub watching him. My son got really scared and then my nephew (who died in 2000) appeared in the room in the see through blue color and then the guy was gone. I am curious to know if anyone knows what see through blue means?

My husband is going to contact a local radio station that helps with these kinds of things, I will keep everyone updated if we find anything out. But information about the colors would be great, if anyone has any. I have read and know from my own experience that black is not good, but what is gray and blue? In the beginning he saw gold, but does not anymore... Please help... Thank you.

The Boy in the Well,"Indiana, United States",Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: The Boy in the Well

F irst off I would like to say that I don't know much about the spirit world and I really don't care. I'm not dead yet so I haven't done too much wrong. I don't mean to offend anyone saying that. My stories are true, a lot of things happened to me when I lived in that house in sunman, I just wanted to try and let you know now on to the story.

Mid spring at my house in sunman. I can't give you a time because it these things took place over about a week. So about friday (again on the ouija board ) we found ourselves talking to a little boy (or so he said}. He told us that he had died in the same old house we were living in and that his parents dumped him in the well out back (just in case).

I went outside in the dark to look down the well, I guess it was closed up because it wasn't too deep. I took a look around, saw nothing and went back inside telling everyone that I didn't see anything (everyone in the room was me, my mom, jacob, ryan, my sisters, and a few of her friends). Well, this kind of thing went on for a few days but things soon went bad.

I couldn't sleep at night, it felt like something was keeping me up and just as I was about to doze off, it felt like something would hit me. I would go into the bathroom and when I would look at the mirror, I wouldn't see me, I saw a face with kind of torn up skin and no eyes. In fear that no one would believe me, I kept these things to myself. Until one morning my mom told us to come down stairs and that she had to talk to us.

When I came down stairs, my mom had tears in her eyes. We asked her what was wrong, she told us that ""these thing are not funny anymore you guys need to stop"" and we were just sitting like ""what the crap are you talking about?"". She said ""the noises at night, the face in the mirror, the words in the bathtub, and this!"". She slapped a piece of paper on the table with some pictures, the pictures were of all of us and the piece of paper said come find me or die written in blood on it.

I knew where the pictures came from, they were always in my sisters lock boxes. I also knew that she lost the key some time back we checked it and it was still locked. After that, my mom checked all of us for anything that blood could have come from and nothing but after all of that, we didn't hear too much from the little boy in the well.

PS I can understand if you have a hard time believing this, I do myself.

Tall Black Figure,Canada,Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: Tall Black Figure

M y name is Brittany Carrigan, I am 12 years old and live in Alberta. My mom and I used to live in an apartment on the third floor.

One morning, I was up quite early and my dog started barking for absolutely no reason. A few minutes later, I turned and saw my lamp flickering uncontrollably. About a week later, my mom and her friend went downstairs to look at a van and I stayed upstairs alone. I don't remember what movie I was watching, but all of a sudden, the lamp just turned off. Now, after that, I was pretty scared and ran downstairs to where my mom was. The scary stuff stopped for about a month, than it began again. I was just going to bed and it was about 9:30pm. I was fixing my pillows when, out of the corner of my eye, I saw a tall black figure standing in the hallway. I quickly turned my head but nothing was there. I told my mom about this and she brought my step dad there for a night. After that, every thing slowed down and wasn't so bad.

Now I live in a house across town from the apartment and still have a hard time even walking by our old home. The worst part about it is that one of my friends live on the second floor of the same apartment.

An Unknown History,United Kingdom,Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: An Unknown History

I haven't found an explanation for these. It is ALWAYS cold in my room. But that's because I keep that fan on high, and the attic in near my bed. Normally, when I wake up in the morning, I feel hot breathing in my face. Or the back of my neck if I'm lying to my side. It happens normally, right when I enter my room. I get the hot breath on the back of my neck. It's like someone is right behind me. The trouble is, I can't hear the breathing. In my room at least.

The other day I was on the computer, typing out a report. I went over to get the glue bottle from my mom's scrap book table when I heard someone say my name, in a breathing hushed voice. Then I felt the breathing. This time, I HEARD the breathing. When I turned around there was no one there. Of course. My mother was outside feeding the seagulls. And my dad and bro were out golfing. I do admit I hear things sometimes, but never like this. I crossed out the possibility of it being my imagination.

Our house has had some Hauntings. When the owner built our house near the sea he and his wife divorced after a year of living there. After their divorce, we bought the house and have been living in it ever since. I had thought a new house couldn't be haunted. I was wrong.

I thought maybe the ghosts might have driven out the owner and wife. But... It took a while at our house for the hauntings to kick in for us. They're getting worse and worse... With every week. But they're not serious... Yet. I thought of our house being built over a graveyard or something... I'm still pondering it.

What makes me wonder is what happened when the owner and wife lived here. But they moved away separately, so I can't ask them. Whatever the case, these are some very shy ghosts!

Preparing Our Way,"Ohio, United States",Family / Friends Visits,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Family / Friends Visits :: Preparing Our Way

T his story was told to me by my best friend's wife upon his passing several years ago. First, let me give you a little background about my friend. He was in a wheel chair and had been ever since an accident with a train as a teenager. He had lost both of his legs up to his hips and was told almost every year that he only had 6 months to live.

He fooled them all, he went on to live another 30+ years. He lived life to the fullest each and every day, never letting anything get him down. Unfortunately, he developed complications later on in his life and his health slowly began turning for the worse. He was always in the hospital and hated every minute of it. I would often visit him and it seemed to brighten his day. If any of his closest friends visited, it was a pick me up for him.

As he got worse, he told his wife he didn't want to die in a hospital, he wanted to die at home. She agreed, even though she wasn't really ready for what was about to happen. I visited him several times, but I just could bear to see him in that state and felt guilty about not doing more with him while he was healthy. Shortly after bringing him home, his wife noticed he would be talking to someone. When asked, he would say he was talking to his mother or an Aunt or Uncle who had already passed before him. That they were there to help him move. His wife thought this was because of the illness or the medicines he was taking. But he insisted that it was his family and friends he was seeing and talking to. I think he thought she could see them too.

She decided to start taking photos when he was talking to these relatives and friends and the images that appeared where breath taking. I only wish I had them to share with the site. The orbs, mist, and streaks she captured over him and around him were not able to be explained. It wasn't dust or any of the normal causes for the orbs as he was in a sanitized room due to the infections he was prone to at the time. I think it was his family and friends coming to show him the way home.

After his passing, the guilt I felt for not spending more time with him was tremendous. But his wife came to me one day and said she had talked to him or rather he had talked to her and that I shouldn't feel guilty as we would see each other again and we would do those things we had planned to do.

Man in the Hall Way,"California, United States",Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: Man in the Hall Way

I 've been avidly reading the stories on this site for several months now and have finally gathered the courage to tell one of my own. It's been two summers since this incident, but it still kind of spooks me. My friend Sarah has a family of 7 and is one of 5 girls. Her oldest sister was graduating from high school and she wanted to attend the graduation with her family. So her mom asked me if I would babysit her 3 younger sister. At the time Rachel was 8, Sammy 3, and Paula 2. So I arrive at the house, said bye to Sarah and the family and wished Anna great graduation wishes.

At about eight o'clock, Rachel started to complain about being hungry which started a chain reaction between all 3 girls whining for food. So off to the kitchen we headed. I told Rachel to go see what she wanted out of the pantry but she refused to open the pantry door, proclaiming she didn't feel right about it. This struck me as really odd due to the fact that she is a very brave determined girl and the house is BRAND NEW, like just built, so it wasn't creepy at all. But all the same, she was 8, so after I took care of their ""empty"" stomach I decided it was quite time and we all sat on the couch to watch Stewart Little. I strategically placed rachel on one side of me and Paula and Sammy on the other side {that way I could keep my eyes on all of them}. At about 10:00pm the house started to feel really really chilly and not a windy cold, but a dry eerie cold, and since it was the middle of may in california with no AC, it struck me as REALLY odd. But it got so bad I told the kids I was going to go borrow one of Sarah's sweatshirts. As soon as I mentioned that I was going into Sarah's room, her door {visible from the sitting room} slammed shut {by itself} with such vengeance, I decided to let it be and deal with the cold.

Sitting back on the couch {girls in original positions} in the freezing cold, I, all of the sudden, felt a feeling of dread flow over me. As I looked up from the TV in discomfort, I saw a person in a crisp white gown dash from the hall way to the computer room. It had golden hair and it was running with its face turned away from me. It was very tall but I didn't see feet so it could have been floating / running. Something lead me to believe it was a young man. And creepiest of all, it looked totally alive!

After seeing whatever it was, I looked at the girls who were all in their places just sitting there and proclaimed that hadn't seen a thing.

I hadn't mentioned anything to Sarah or Anna until 4 weeks had passed and finally, I relayed the tale. Sarah looked up at me like I had just punched her in the face. And she began to tell me how she had see the same exact person only 5 days before I had. But she just shrugged it off.

Although no one else in the house have seen it, Sarah's mom and dad have heard shrill shrieks from that hall and their bedroom door does unlock and open itself.

Sarah and I are the same age, is that why only us have seen it? Or perhaps the thing is the same age as us and was buried under the house years ago? But what is quite puzzling is that it looked completely solid, I thought ghosts were supposed to be transparent?

666,"Colorado, United States",Haunted Places,"I haven't posted anything on here for some time now, and nothing's really happened... But today something happened. Actually before this, at school, there was another encounter I had. First off, at school, I had gotten little sleep the night before. I was being kept up all night by strange sounds, but they didn't sound like anything supernatural. It sounded like pipes. But the next day in school, I realized the entire day felt like a dream, almost, because I was so tired. So I sat there, nodding off, and yes, got YELLED AT ONCE! But I noticed that the entire day, I was so tired, nothing quite seemed real. Finally toward the end of the day, I did fall asleep, but I was in the corner and nobody noticed. I looked up and noticed this guy walking around the corner of the room, and it looked like Jerry. He had the exact outfit I've always seen Jerry in. I didn't see him again after that though...

But today I was woken up by the phone. I was too tired to answer it, and I couldn't see the caller ID clearly (the phone sits facing me on the stand, right next to the bed) but I could tell it was nobody I knew. But then the answering machine picked up. It has always had the same weird voice that picks up and says we're not here. But this time, I heard another voice as it was talking. I couldn't tell anything that was being said, but it was male, and even after the ""beep"" I still heard him talking. The only thing I could manage to hear, at the end, was ""Why won't you see me? Of course you're there, don't ignore me!"" so I laughed thinking it was a wrong number. Now the phone always keeps the number displayed for a short amount of time so I kind of wondered who it was, and checked the ID. The number was 666. No joke, the caller ID displayed ""666"". But it didn't even keep a record of this so I have no proof. This same thing has happened before when... I ASSUME Jerry has CALLED me... But the answering machine never even records his voice on the answering machine, and when I went upstairs, there were NO NEW MESSAGES. Yet I CLEARLY heard a voice after it beeped. I had been awoken by it and I know what I heard, and SAW ""666"". The first time, it displayed the number ""9"" when I got a mystery call. Now, just ""666"".

Is this Jerry or something else doing this? Was that Jerry's voice I heard on the phone, or was I DREAMING? I don't even know what to think anymore. Jerry hasn't bothered me in a while, so this is new.

Is Just My Imagination?,"Colorado, United States",Misc,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Misc :: Is Just My Imagination?

I live in a house on Galena dr. but I only go there for the weekends. I also live in an apartment with my mom and it's small so I have no worries, but when I'm in a big space it's creepy and gives me this strange feelings. My step dads home was built about 37 years ago when he was born, so that makes it old and maybe haunted. To get to the point, these strange happenings just started recently and now I can't go into a dark area alone. When I was going to my room I thought someone was in the bathroom because I heard the toilet flush and the door is broken, so we can't close it, so I said I was coming up but when I got up there, no one was there, which creeped me out. Then, when I was watching tv in the family room next to the computer room, I saw the door open slightly so I thought it was the cats because I have 4 of them but, no, the cats were all up stairs. Then, the tv turned on by it self right after I turned it off. Then the cats were acting weird and kept staring up the stairs as if someone was there. And today the light in the master bedroom kept flickering. Though this was longer ago, the light in my room went out by it self. And all this happened in one house. Tell me do you think this place is haunted or is just my imagination?

Uncle Tom,"Wisconsin, United States",Family / Friends Visits,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Family / Friends Visits :: Uncle Tom

M y family has this old farm, about 20 miles outside Mauston, Wisconsin. My family used to visit every Sunday and play in the bluffs around the farm. The farm house was built in the early 1900's by my great-great grandparents. Today, my great aunt and uncle live there. So on one visit, I was washing up for dinner and something caught my eye in the bath tub. Well, that bathroom wasn't there when the house was built, it was a pantry. Later on, it was made into a bathroom. So I turned around and saw a man wearing overalls and writing in a leather bound book. He had really bright blue eyes and dark brown hair, and his leg was twisted funny. When he noticed me he let out a hearty laugh and pulled the plug to the tub, he went right down the drain. I was eight years old and terrified when that strange man just went right down the drain. I shot out of that bathroom and told my mama and great aunt what I saw. My great aunt says ""Well that sounds like Thomas..."" I'd never seen a picture of Uncle Tom but he was my great uncle and died shortly before I was born. He was crippled and died in that house. My mama says that I don't have to be afraid of Uncle Tom's ghost because any ghost in that house is bound to be friendly since it was built with a heck of a lot of love.

Out of the Corner of my Eye,"California, United States",Misc,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Misc :: Out of the Corner of my Eye

U sually whenever I go to my room, I do something and I sometimes see things out of the corner of my eye. It's kind of creepy, also I sometimes see things out of the ordinary and sometimes I feel like I'm being watched by something evil, something way too evil. This whole deal happens at random, so it happens at any second or any day but there was this one time where I thought I saw a woman in long black hair and a white robe, it kind of looks like the grudge but I don't know, really, so it kind of really scares the heck out of me. Also when I come in my dark room, I sometimes feel like something behind me and I feel evil energy and I pray to the Lord to put a shield over my house so the evilness would go away. After the prayer it was gone, then a few days later, it came back and I could seriously tell it wanted revenge and I could still see the spirit but I decided to live with it.

Send me your comments thanks. Oh and one more thing, I could help people with their encounters so don't hesitate to comment me on your problems. Thanks.

Julia's House,"Michigan, United States",Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: Julia's House

M y friend Julia has lived in the same house since we met. She doesn't know how old her house is but her dad said that he used to ride his bike past the house when he was a little boy. I have spent the night at her house too many times to count and many strange things have happened. There are at least five DIFFERENT entities in her house. A little girl in a white dress with long brown hair, a very tall man dressed in black with a big axe, a man with a hat and cloak that walks around the hallways, a young man with black eyes, and a guy wearing a long sleeved white shirt with short hair and jeans that walks around her kitchen and dining room.

I have seen all of these entities at least once, and some of them I have seen more than once. Most of them don't seem harmful but there are two of them that scare me: the boy with the black eyes and the man with the axe. The boy with the black eyes comes when you are trying to sleep and he talks. At first he just mumbles but then you can make out what he is saying and he says very mean things. He swears a lot and one time, when Julia was laying in bed, he started talking right by her ear and called her a b**ch and said he was going to beat her. The man with the axe seems to be chasing the little girl. She shows up and then disappears, and then shortly after he will walk in the room and look around and walk out.

I've had many experiences in the house where I was getting up to use the bathroom or get a drink and I saw someone standing there watching me from the hallway or from the dining room. I have also heard them walking around the house. They talk sometimes and turn the television and radio on and off. It is strange to me that there are so many of them.

Can anyone tell me a reason why there would be so much traffic in one house? As I said, most of them do not scare me, I'm just curious as to why they are all in that one house.

Strange Mist and Poltergeist Activities,United Kingdom,Poltergeists / Physical Manifestations,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Poltergeists / Physical Manifestations :: Strange Mist and Poltergeist Activities

A fter moving house a couple of times, since we moved back from cyprus, I have always got the feeling I'm either being watched or have actually had someone or something keeping me company. It first started when I was about 9 years old and I lived with my mum, brother and sister. We lived in a house on the end of a road situated in a quiet village which is full of old houses and a church and the house that we lived in was home to a few people that have died in the past. My mum was sitting downstairs, either watching tv or just sitting there quietly, when she noticed what sounded like a man from the 1900's walking down the stairs and through a wall. Now I don't know if he came from my room or hers but after that happened, I started to have very weird dreams, one of them being my cousin being handed to my auntie by the same man that my mum saw.

Ever since then, we have moved twice, the house we are living in now has brought them feelings back to me where something has been with me. A few months back, we went to a party and I stayed at a friend's house but when I got back to my house, I noticed what looked like mist hovering above the french doors we have in our living room. Now I got 6 different people to come and see if they could see what I could, but not one of them could. This then brought a really bad feeling to my body as I stood on a chair to look closer, this mist looked like it had tiny beads of water whooshing around and coming up to me, then moving back again, and ever since I have encountered the same mist every now and then, just appearing out of nowhere. I really can not explain it so I'm sorry if it sounds a bit strange, this has now stopped and whatever is doing this has decided to get stronger and stronger, because not only am I seeing these things, but it has gotten to the point where things are being moved.

For example, I was sitting in the front room, about 4 days ago, and I was cooking a pizza. I sat watching a program when all of a sudden the smoke alarm went off, so I went into the kitchen, there was no smoke at all and the oven door was wide open. I knew I had shut it before I went into the other room, I thought nothing of it, so I went to look in the oven and the door slammed shut like someone had done it in anger because it shook the whole oven. This brought a chilling feeling to me like someone was stood right next to me. It made me feel like something is here to stay, because ever since then, I have had a whole cd collection thrown across my bedroom floor, even thought I have a baseball in a case holding them in place, so there is no way those cd's could have just fallen off by themselves.

Whatever is here with me gives me the strongest feeling its the man from the 1900's. If anyone can help me or explain this in a different way please get in touch.

Brookfield Woods,"Illinois, United States",Orbs / Lights / Mists,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Orbs / Lights / Mists :: Brookfield Woods

I n Brookfield, IL, things out of the ordinary are continuing to go on in the woods. Apparently, Native Americans used to settle there back in the 1300's. Well, I myself witnessed the first Orb sighting in my entire life, on Monday, April 23rd, 2007 at 10:00 p.m. We were in the woods for over an hour and I listened to one of the three other people there telling us about past experiences. One odd thing that happened was in the river that runs by the path, the water burst loudly like a large fish that jumped up and back in the water. The river was still before that and no trees had branches big enough to make a large burst like that. Also, one friend of mine was with a bunch of people when he felt ""a baseball bat hit"" in his back. He fell to his knees and the rest of them had to carry him out. There was no sight of an animal because they didn't hear anything or see it. Plus, he was in the middle of the group at the time and no one obviously would hit him so hard he couldn't walk by himself. Then another weird thing was occurring frequently. My friends and other people we don't know have seen actual orbs with a camera and with their own eyes. Some were red colored, blue, and a dark fuzzy cloud-like figure. It would stay as long as a minute and then disappear quickly. This happened too many times.

Well, this was all talk to me until I saw it that night. We were walking out of the woods and two of our friends saw an Orb, dark color, and it disappeared. As we left, we turned back and watched all dark areas closely. After two minutes, I saw a blue circular Orb that stood there for 3 seconds and then left. I wasn't joking. I was stunned by what I saw. I didn't look at any lights before. I seriously stared at the darkness and it popped up. Then, we saw two more areas along the trees where a cloudy-like image would float and then move away. I really never believed in spirits rising or ghosts until I saw these moments.

No one took drugs and we have brains not to be lying and trying to make publicity out of this. It happens too many times for it to be false. We still are pursuing adventures out there to see what is happening. In conclusion, I speak with 100% truth of what I saw and I will believe in it forever.

Apparitions in my Bedroom,"Alabama, United States",Apparitions / Voices / Touches,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Apparitions / Voices / Touches :: Apparitions in my Bedroom

I 'm 11 years old and I have already witnessed 3 events involving ghosts in my house. It was about two weeks from Christmas. It was really late at night, because I couldn't go to sleep. I looked up out my window, and saw something. It was an orange mist... WITH EYES. I was scared to death, but didn't make a sound. It was creepy, because it stared at me. I just got as low as I could, hoping it would go away. It did, but then something worse happened. I blinked, and in it's place was another ghost. Don't say this is a ""figment of imagination"" because I pinched and punched myself to make sure I was awake. The ghost was a person. He seemed old-fashioned, about early 1900s, I'd say. All of him either had a pale tint, or his clothes were pale and so was his skin. He was carrying something, I think it was a gun or an axe. It was just staring across the room. It was the last thing I saw before I went to sleep.

Two years later, 2007, late January, I woke up and saw something else. Something in a dark red robe was walking toward the foot of my bed, toward a table. It put its hand on the table like it picked something up or put something down, and vanished. I again made sure I was awake.

A Life of Haunted Houses,Australia,Psychic / Medium,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Psychic / Medium :: A Life of Haunted Houses

I 'm 17 and I've never written anything before, so sorry if it isn't all that clear! It's all true and it kind of scares me! It started when I was 2 or 3, my parents, brother and I lived in this dodgy old house, I can't remember where, the people before us were into occult and stuff. Every night I would sit up and refuse to sleep in my room because I could see people in my room, I can't really remember, it's what my dad tells me, I used to pull my mattress out of my room and lay it out in front of my parents room, made perfectly. I can't even move one now let alone when I was 3. My dad would ask me in the mornings and I would say ""the bad man keeps talking to me"". Everything stopped for years until I was 13.

It was holidays and mum was home and I had just woken up, I was just laying there when I froze, I heard someone scream ""oh god help me, please help"" thinking it was my mum, I jumped out of bed and ran to my mum to ask if she was ok, all she said was ""no, I'm fine, I didn't hear or say anything"" so, a little freaked out, I went back to my room and back to bed, about half an hour later I heard ""hey didn't you help me"" and that's when the freaky stuff started happening.

One night, my friend was sleeping over and we were just sitting around laughing with the lights out when I saw something in the corner of my eye, I looked straight at it, it looked kind of like a shadow, but there was no light to cause one and it was darker than the room I was in, it was just moving across the wall, I instantly asked my friend if she could see it and she couldn't. It was heading to the hallway, when dad walked in to tell us to quiet down. He instantly noticed how cold it was and we were told to go to my bedroom.

About a month later, I woke up in the middle of the night to find a dark figure standing over me, my room was slightly lit because of my stereo and it was CLEARLY there, I screamed and hid under my blankets and didn't come out until morning, once again, nothing happened for a couple of months.

This time, when I woke up, the man was there again at the end of my bed, but there was a little girl in front of him, in a white victorian style dress, she looked really upset and I instantly knew she wasn't bad, but the dude behind her was. I went back to sleep hoping they would go away.

When dad and I moved in the house, the very first morning we moved in dad heard a ""hello"", not really thinking he said hello back. When dad came in to say goodbye (he was going to work), he asked me what I was doing out of bed so early and I didn't know what he was talking about. After he left I heard a ""hi"" in a guy's voice and I thought dad came back for something so I thought nothing of it. During the year we lived there, we saw a load of orbs and things moving, later we found out a family had died in a bus accident and they had lived in that house before us!

We've moved house again (yes we move a lot) and in the current house I'm at, it's the worst. Its an oldish country house, pretty crappy looking, but clearly has a history! We moved in about 3 months ago now and since the first night there, I have been seeing things. Almost every night, I see an old man walk across my room. He's there but he isn't?, sort of like see through. He has a big bushy beard and looks amish. He gives me a nasty look every time he comes past my bed. Lights that are off get turned on frequently, same with doors opening all the time.

It could be 10000 degrees outside but you will have to wear a jumper inside because its freezing, and it's not air conditioning because we don't even have a working heater right now. And things are always moving around the house, I'll put my guitar in the lounge room and it will be in the kitchen in the morning and I know it's not my dad because guitars are like gold to him and I have also seen the little girl again a few times and I'm not sure why she is following me.

Dad doesn't see anything really, but I do all the time, my nana was the same, she still sees things to this day, I'm not sure what to do, how to get rid of them or how to help them, I'm starting to get sick of being scared half to death every night!

The Strange Visions I Have When I Awake,United Kingdom,Misc,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Misc :: The Strange Visions I Have When I Awake

W hat I'm about to tell you all is what I believe to be real, it's very strange and has no logical explanation other than related, I think, to a supernatural episode. These episodes started when I was about 11/12 years old. I'm now 32, and to be honest I haven't really thought much about them until recently. The first time it happened was when I was a kid. I was just waking up in the morning (you know sometimes when you wake up you have that calmness about you, you're taking in the surroundings still). So I'm just opening my eyes lying in bed, and I'm looking straight ahead in my bedroom. In front of me is the head of an old man with a white beard, that heads floating at the sort of height it would be if it was attached to a body, the man's face was just very observant, his eyes were blinking so it was animated. No real expression just observing. I felt very calm, not frightened, I closed my eyes and thought it be gone when I look again, it wasn't. On a second attempt it disappeared. And that was that, ever since that night, I'd sleep with the covers over my eyes so I couldn't see that area of the room. And of course I eventually sort of forgot about this over the years and passed it off as maybe my imagination.

Until 2 years ago, I hadn't experienced this since that morning. I had a similar episode, I won't go into the detail, because this story will be too long, but this time the face I saw (again just the head) was that of a relative, again I was calm through out the episode... And again not long after, I thought, well... Maybe this is some sort of sleep paralysis, or my mind playing tricks on me coming out of deep sleep.

Okay now's the real bombshell... This has been going on now continuously for the last month, and I'll admit I don't know what to think about it. Me and my wife moved house about a year and a half ago, and there hasn't been anything strange going on until just recently. I had a terrible nightmare one night recently and upon waking in the the middle of the night, realizing it was just a dream, I turned around in the bed facing the wardrobe, and right in front of my eyes is another vision... This time it's like a part of a wooden fence maybe, with a hole in it, with an eye appearing through the fence, the eyes concentrating on me and it's live for sure because it's blinking. I was that tired at the time, that I didn't really react, didn't jump out my bed and start screaming like you think you would, but laid there calmly, I turned my head and went back to sleep...

The following week, again I was awoke after another nightmare. I woke and thought, well that was some evil dream, I turn my head round facing the wardrobe, and this time there's some sort of a scripture, a scroll (long and narrow), etched in black... It was so black that in stood out in the dark room like a light-bulb. This time I was fully aware of what was happening and was more awake than the previous occasion. I put my glasses on (slightly short sighted) to see better and it's still there, even clearer, I couldn't quite make out the letters in the scroll, it was not English, more like symbols, the nearest thing I could make it out to be was like Japanese writing maybe. I laid there and stared at it... I watched it disappear after about 20 seconds, it sort of drifted away from left to right, almost like someone was rubbing it out in sand or on a chalkboard... Now I know your mind can play tricks on you, and even after all these episodes I still believed it was related to sleep patterns or state of mind after sleep. But when I closed my eyes, that scripture I was staring at was etched into my eye (like when you look at a light-bulb and when you close your eyes it's stained on your eye lens). I could still make out the writing, so was this real after all?

Last week, I'm sure it happened again, again I woke up (it's the same cycle, as you can see, when ever I'm seeing these things) I turned to look at this dark object but instead, I was drawn to a more colorful image to its left. It was my Grandfather from what I could tell at the time. He was smiling, I actually called out ""are you really there?"" (not expecting an answer) and this distant but close voice I could hear, as if it was talking through a pair of headphones to me ""yes Paul I am"". For some reason I felt relief, and I just went back to sleep.

Last night was my last vision (recently over the space of a month, I have had 4 visions or meetings, whatever you want to call them). Last night was some more scriptures. I have been avoiding looking in the direction of that wardrobe at night these days but for some reason I seem to always get drawn to it when I wake, as if I'm expecting someone. I had the covers right over my face so only a small section of that wall was visible once turning round. And it just happens to be in that corner! This time, last night, I was so aware that I did flinch for a second... It was etched in black again, this time it looked more like a combination of moon symbols? This shape "" ( "", it eventually faded away similar to the previous scroll but upwards...

So that's my story so far, I'm not sure if what I'm seeing is real or some kind of Sleep Paralysis... I don't know... Well, I hope you found this interesting, it would be in interesting to know your thoughts about what's been going on here. I'm by far no expert in ghosts and never really took a particular interest until the recent events. Has anyone else experienced anything like this?

Noises in the Night,"Ohio, United States",Apparitions / Voices / Touches,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Apparitions / Voices / Touches :: Noises in the Night

I have always believed in spirits and the undead but I never thought anything would ever happen to me... Until two nights ago when it finally did. I am 17 years old and I have never been so scared. I was really nervous to turn off my lights the other night but I didn't know why because I am never nervous about a good night's sleep. I fell asleep around 8:30pm and didn't wake up until midnight... All the clocks in my room read 12:00 and the air in my room was so cold that I could see my breath and it is NEVER that cold anywhere in my house. I laid in bed breathing heavily and I kept hearing a creaking noise under my bed and then I heard a scuffing noise going across my carpet by my closet. The scuffing noise then turned around and headed toward my bed and all of a sudden a huge black figure stood up over my bed for a split second and made a low screaming noise and then left. As it was screaming, a huge wind hit me in the face... And the next thing I knew it was time for me to wake up for school.

Did I dream this? Because when I woke up, I had goose bumps and all my clocks still read 12:00 and... I have a bunch of boxes under my bed and they were spread out all across my floor. What's going on? It really freaks me out!

Strange Man Spotted Again,United Kingdom,Apparitions / Voices / Touches,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Apparitions / Voices / Touches :: Strange Man Spotted Again

N ow if you have not read my previous story Strange Man in My House than I'll just inform you that my middle sister (Ria) on several occasions has seen a male figure in our house while there has been no one in the house except her.

Only last night did he ""show"" himself again with others in the house. Now I was downstairs in the kitchen, and my middle sister's boyfriend (Carl) was in her room. Now Ria came out of her bedroom and went partially into my little sisters (Alice) room and noticed a figure laying in the bed. Turned away from the door. Of course Ria assumed it was Alice (The bedroom light was turned off, so it was darkish).

Ria stood in the door way looking at Alice in bed and could hear the shower going in the bathroom next door to Alice's room. She then walked downstairs into the kitchen to surprisingly find me in the kitchen. She said to me ""I thought you were in the shower?"" and I told her how I had been downstairs for ages, she then asked ""so who's in the shower then?"" I told her it must be her Boyfriend OR Alice. But she told me it can't be as Carl was in her room and Alice was asleep in her own bedroom.

I said to just go check, so she was walking back up the stairs when Alice walked out of the bathroom (wet and in a towel) obviously been having a shower. So Ria rushed into Alice's bedroom only to find no one in the bed.

I teased her that it was the strange man again. But Ria was really spooked. Maybe she thought she had seen someone laying the bed (it had been darkish) or maybe it was the strange man again? Ria was adamant that she had seen a figure in the bed. I believe her as she doesn't make stuff like this up, as ghosts etc don't interest her. Alice had assured us she had been in the shower for a good 15-20 minutes before she met Ria in the hallway.

Who is this strange male figure? Does he even exist?. It does give me something to tease her about.

Sleep Over Terror,United Kingdom,Apparitions / Voices / Touches,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Apparitions / Voices / Touches :: Sleep Over Terror

A bout a month ago, I got invited to my friend Kira's for a sleep over along with my other 3 friends Sarah, Amy and Tijara (TJ for short). We did our usual, stayed up all night. By 5 in the morning, weird crap started happening.

We could've sworn that her plastic cat that has glow in the dark eyes was blinking and it's not mechanical or anything. Then later on, we saw this shadow on the wall (and yes the lights were off!) and was shaped like a person. I was dead scared, quivering and everything, you could ask anyone that was there, I was ready to piss in my pants.

Then after that, we saw like a white figure run out of the room (we opened the door after the cat thing because we were scared to death) so we followed it (me in the front because they wanted to ""sacrifice"" me since I'm the youngest there). It went into the kitchen and saw one of the plates fall to the floor ON IT'S OWN and shatter. We freaked out and ran back to the room. We went to sleep and woke up 6 hours later.

I haven't slept at her house in a while, mainly because of that experience. It's fun to sleep over at her place, but I just don't wanna get a heart attack.

My Great Grandparents House,"Wisconsin, United States",Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: My Great Grandparents House

W hen I was about 9 I lived in my great grandparents house with my parents (my great grandparents were already deceased). I remember I was always afraid to sleep in my room, I was just always feeling watched. One night, I remember waking up having to go to the bathroom and I saw this big redish thing coming out from my window. It looked like it was made of clay. My mom said she saw something similar only the figure she saw was blue and it was in her room coming from her window. She also said it looked like it was made of clay.

Then one night my dad was sleeping downstairs on the couch and my mom was upstairs in there bedroom. Dad asked mom the next morning why she was standing over him while he was sleeping and mom said she wasn't, she was upstairs sleeping (my dad doesn't believe in ghosts or anything). He just brushed it off.

Often times when I would take a bath in that house I would hear people talking but it didn't sound like my parents. One time it scared me so bad I ended up grabbing my towel and running out of the bathroom. We moved out of that house when I was 12. I am 16 now and we had to move back to that house (my parents got a divorce). I keep having the feeling of being watched. I'm not scared like I was when I was younger, it just creeps me out. Also I have been having dreams of me or my younger brother being crushed by the big rock pile thing we have in our backyard. I only have that dream when I'm at my house. I still hear the voices when I'm taking a shower even when I'm the only one in the house.

Often times I feel cold spots. Sometimes the tv will turn on and off or the vacuum. I'm too scared to talk to the voices or say anything regarding the ""ghosts"" in my house, honestly I'm scared of hearing anything talk back. Me and my friend Nicole experimented with an Ouija board but I stopped after 5 minutes of it because I was scared. I also hate the basement, it's not refinished or anything it has a dirt floor and the walls are made of rocks (I have to go down there to do laundry). I feel watched and I swear I felt something play with my hair when I was down there. The voices I hear sometimes are not even in English, they're in German. My great grandparents came to America from Germany so maybe it's their voices I hear.

Unknown Caller,Canada,Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: Unknown Caller

B efore my husband and I were married, we rented a house with a roommate. It was a 2 story house with us upstairs and our roommate downstairs. We quickly realized that we were not the only people that were there. We had a few people over one night and I had a headache and went to bed early. Later when I woke up, I went to get a drink downstairs and my husband asked what I had been doing upstairs. He said it sounded like I was jumping around and banging things but I had been dead asleep. After that there were many nights he would be downstairs on the couch and would hear footsteps coming down the stairs and look and no one would be there.

Then one day I was showering and my husband came into the bathroom to brush his teeth. No one else was there and all of a sudden we heard a women's voice call my name twice. He went out to see who was there and there was no one but we both heard it.

On a second occasion everyone was out and I was by myself drying my hair and heard the same voice call my name

Mariposa Ghost,"North Carolina, United States",Apparitions / Voices / Touches,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Apparitions / Voices / Touches :: Mariposa Ghost

T here are two Mariposa Bridges, a new one and an old one. The old mariposa bridge isn't used any more. A long time ago, there was woman who's car broke down on the old bridge. She was killed by a drunk driver. Some people say there are nights you can see her upper torso drifting from one end to the other of the bridge. I didn't believe this so I went to see for myself, I didn't see the upper torso, but I did hear a faint cry that sound like a woman. It may have been in my head I don't know, the bridge is located on the outskirts of Stanley, North Carolina. Any one care to see for themselves go ahead. But beware the old Mariposi bridge is condemned.

The ghost may or may not be a myth, but gravity is a certainty that would put a turd in anyone's punch bowl. I would really hate to see some one getting hurt over this. If anyone have details of this bridge fell free to add.

"Not Scared, But Disturbed","Washington, United States",Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: Not Scared, But Disturbed

I 'm hoping you might have a few answers or suggestions for me. I'll start at the beginning: The previous house we lived in was 25 miles away, we lived there for 4 years. There was finished attic space there that we used for storage. We had planned to make it a guest room, but never did because it was always cold and we liked having the storage space. However, I always had an uneasy feeling when I was up there. My niece who was 14/15 at the times she was there, told me that there was a lady was there... She was dressed in 1800's attire and she didn't mean any harm. I sometimes noticed the same feeling in the kitchen. On an odd note, I baked significantly better than I ever have when I lived in that house... Maybe it was the oven.

We have lived in our current house for a little over 2 years. The previous owner was pre-foreclosure when we obtained it. She had been practicing witchcraft for some time... Hard to say for me how long. She was in her early thirties. One thing I noticed is that all around the house there were what appeared to be purposely placed blackened hand prints on doorways and near windows. They weren't completely obvious, but they were there. We painted and cleaned the house for a few weeks prior to moving in. When we moved in, I noticed a more intense feeling like I had in our previous house's attic in several areas of the house. We have the same finished attic-type space in this house which we use for storage, but there is a spare room up there. My niece, then 16, told me there were many different spirits upstairs and that bad things happened there. We usually have the door to upstairs closed and only use it when moving things in or out from storage.

Last week, my husband and I slept upstairs for three nights while out of town relatives stayed in our room. The door was open the entire time. We had sex on the third night (I feel this has meaning for some reason). Since we returned to downstairs, I've noticed that uneasy feeling several times around the house... Particularly in the living room. I've noticed one of my dogs (a nearly two year old female) staring near the hallway that exits the upstairs and enters the living room during the evening. She looks as if something is really interesting to her as if there's a big bug crawling or another animal sitting there... That kind of look. The other dog, an older male, doesn't notice anything.

The other night, my husband fell asleep on the couch. Since he doesn't believe in ghosts per say, he waited to say anything, but last night he told me that he woke up suddenly and saw something hazy on top of him and had felt weight. He was weirded out, but not ""scared"" by it. Two days prior to that was his step-dad's funeral. I feel he was passing through and saying hi and this was unrelated to the many other spirits in our house, but it pushed me to seek answers.

Here's something else I want to throw out there and that's why I thought the sex had meaning. Since we've moved in that house and not prior, I've had odd health-related interferences with my ability to have sex often. I'm thinking there may be a relation there. Simply because they are new and doctors think there's no medical reason for them.

I have never felt threatened or worried about the spirits. I am however, interested in hearing your take on the situation because I'm feeling a bit out of sorts.

Midnight Shadow,"Ohio, United States",Apparitions / Voices / Touches,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Apparitions / Voices / Touches :: Midnight Shadow

I 'm going to give a bit of background info on what room I was in, and how I can try to figure what went on. The computer is located in the computer room. This happened when we had the old computer, one that wasn't exactly the brightest, but it could still cause shadows when one walked by. The computer is located near a window, which you can see the road from. When cars drive by at night, you can see the lights reflecting on the walls, and they travel across before they vanish.

I was sitting in my computer chair, talking to a friend online, with my cat sitting behind me on a chair. I was bored, and I kept swaying back and forth in the spinning-computer chair, watching my shadow behind me while waiting for my friend to reply to what I sent. It was quiet, and no one in the house was up, because my brother was in his room, snoring (loudly I might add) and my mum was upstairs, and if she were to come down, I would hear the stairs creak.

Well, I turned back to the computer to look at what my friend had just said, when I heard a noise. I couldn't really tell what it was, it just sounded odd, so I turned to look at Autumn (my cat), who was staring at the doorway leading into the living room. I looked up, just in time to see a black haze, that looked at if someone were standing, before it vanished. My cat jumped off the chair to go into the living room, so I got up to follow, to see if my dog was up, or if my brother had come out of his room. When I stood in the door frame, I didn't see anything, other than my dog sleeping under one of the tables.

I don't know what I saw, but it freaked me out quite a bit. Of course, I don't fuss about it anymore. But I thought I'd tell the story.

Oh, and this happened at the beginning of December, 2006. I was fourteen then, and I am still that age now. So it wasn't to long ago.

And, you can believe this if you'd like, or not. One possibility is that my eyes were playing tricks on me, because it was really late into the night. Actually... it'd be extremely early the next morning. Around 3:30 AM. But, I'm still unsure, whether it was paranormal or not, I do not fuss.

I know there are spirits in my house, but they do not bother anyone.

Someone Is Touching Me,Canada,Apparitions / Voices / Touches,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Apparitions / Voices / Touches :: Someone Is Touching Me

I 've never really seen a ghost straight up, full out in its form, but I've seen orbs and feel presences. Right now as I sit here in my room I feel a chill, my room is the coldest in the house... There isn't any wind or anything, my windows are shut and the curtains closed and I'm watching my dream catcher which hangs from my ceiling sway back and forth lightly, it's turning kind of.

I've always felt a presence and such. I don't like to sleep alone and I get rather creeped out. I have a few stories, not many, just a few about my experiences. I live in an apartment type thing where somebody lives upstairs and we get the full downstairs. I lock the doors so that nobody can come in. The man upstairs is very religious and he's really old.

One night, my father informed me he was going out for the weekend. I was kind of freaked out to be staying alone for the weekend but I agreed. I've never really been good at being alone because of my experiences at my old house that were similar. So, I locked all the doors and windows and went to sleep in my room, which creeps me out a lot of the time. I had woken up several hours later at midnight because I felt a hand caressing my thigh and when I opened my eyes I had my hands above my head, hanging over the bed with my hands clasped and my shirt pulled up over my head near my clasped hands. Nobody was there and my door was closed and everything was locked and in place and nothing out of the ordinary. Of course, I was creeped out and only saw something fade out above me. I didn't sleep for the rest of the weekend. Although, I did feel hands touching my shoulders, legs and stomach under my chest that weekend while trying to talk on the computer with friends. It was creepy.

You all probably won't believe me, I know. That's a chance I'm willing to take, facing humiliation. This is the second time I've ever told anybody other then my sister who said she had similar things happen to her after she used a ouija board when she was around my age... I've never used a ouija board though. So... Yeah. I don't know.

Sometimes I feel like somebody NEEDS to talk to me, like they've got something on their mind and I just get this sense that I need to go find them. I once found my friend crying at a park and said she had been thinking my name (I hadn't spoken to her in years prior to that) and next thing she knew I had come running. I didn't know WHERE I was going, I just knew I had to go there before something bad happened.

I just felt the need to tell some of my stories whether you people believe me or not. I have no psychological problems and I'm perfectly healthy, so, we can rule that one out. ;) Alright? Maybe my mind just plays tricks on me... But these are all true stories. I really would like to know why and what all of this means.

Pap Gives Me a Sign,"Pennsylvania, United States",Family / Friends Visits,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Family / Friends Visits :: Pap Gives Me a Sign

I recently wrote a story about my grandfather's ghost that my mother had told me. Now I believe I had my own experience. On Monday 4/16/07 at about 4 am I was standing in my kitchen. It was a week and one day before my step father Carl died. He had something on tv but I wasn't sure what though. I was standing there thinking about my grandfather when suddenly I saw a black shadow figure on the tv screen. It was on the bottom right hand corner and went about halfway up the screen. The strange thing was that it looked as if someone was in the screen looking out into our den. Also, it didn't even look like it was part of whatever was on tv. The shadow looked like my grandfather to a T from his bald head in the middle to his hair on the sides. I stood there and thought that maybe just because I was thinking about him I thought there was something there. However, when I noticed the figure it startled me so much that it made my chest tighten up. I felt frozen in fear and couldn't move.

If it was nothing it wouldn't have had that effect on me. Then 15 minutes later our basement door opened by itself. Even though it wasn't closed all the way, there was no draft underground. I didn't feel any cold air until that door opened. I truly believe it was my grandfather that I saw.

Several weeks before I remember being very upset. I cried and asked him why was my mother lucky enough to see him and not me. I told him that I missed him so much and that I had to grow up without him (He died when I was 3). I know what I saw and I believe he heard my cries of sadness and came to see me as I wished.

Old Man Jack,South Africa,Misc,"A s I had previously promised, this is another of my strange experiences. I was about 13 years old at the time. Earlier on that morning, an elderly gentlemen, Jack, who lived in the house situated behind ours, had passed on as a result of a long illness. He was a kindly old man and the children around were always visiting him. That evening, my brother and I had rented a video. We also telephoned and invited our friend Owen, who often came over. The arrangement was to begin watching the movie at eight. It was already 20 minutes past 8'o clock, and Owen had still not arrived. Almost an hour later, he came strolling in through our back door, apologizing for being late. Owen explained that he had taken the short route to get to us, by jumping the fence in Old man Jacks yard.

As the old man was sitting outside on a little wooden chair beneath the tree, he had to stop and chat for a while. The old man told him that he would be leaving very soon, and that we would no longer see him. He also asked Owen to convey his best wishes to all the kids in the neighborhood, who visited him. Thereafter it was general talk. Poor Owen had no idea, that the he had just had a conversation with the spirit of a man who had died earlier that day.

That night after hearing the truth, our dear friend refused to go home, and spent the night at our place. He visited us often, but never at night again. The burial was held a few days later, and there has never been any more appearances from Old man Jack.

The Hand,Mexico,Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: The Hand

T his story happened about 7 years ago, I was coming out of the bathroom, turned off the light, and then when I was going to go in the kitchen I saw a hand in the door to the kitchen, sort of like telling me to go there, I thought it was one of my brothers but as I came in the kitchen I realized I was alone in the house, there was no one else. I was so scared. But after a while I sort of forgot about it. That is until 2-3 years ago.

Next to the kitchen is the living room, and sometimes I stayed up late doing homework. This particular day it was 4 a.m. My family all had gone to bed, when I felt someone pass by, and a chill ran up my spine. At first I thought that it was someone in my family, but 1 hour passed and no one came back so I got up and when I got near the bathroom I realized the light was on, and no one was there. I freaked out more.

The next day, I was again in the same place doing homework again when suddenly I felt it again, and almost everyday that I stayed up until that hour around 4:00, I could always feel like someone was watching me.

Beside me, no one seem to feel, or see anything. People who lived there before had said that they saw fire, or that someone threw coins at them, so I never knew exactly what it was.

Third Party Encounter,"Alaska, United States",Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: Third Party Encounter

I 've changed the names of the individuals involved. We've all known that if we could just get someone besides ourselves to see and hear what we do, then we won't feel so crazy. At least, that's how I've always felt. After so long of experiencing activities in my bedroom and not being able to capture anything on film or audio, I always told myself, ""if just one other person could experience this for themselves..."" but it's never happened... Until yesterday.

I rarely let any of my friends come into my room, but this day was a special case. Let me back up a little here. Wednesday afternoon while at school, I made plans with one of my guy friends to hang out at one of the malls in town. He said that he would stop by my house and then we could walk there, picking up the others in our group along the way. Now, after school I walked home (it was around 3 at that point) and called my mom to double check with her that the outing was okay. My call made, I went through my bag to pull out my homework so my mom would know I was done with it. As I did, I could've sworn I'd heard a hiss come from the hallway. It freaked me out, of course, but since we have a cat, I didn't think anything of it.

My friend showed up and, just as we were about to leave, he asked if he could borrow a Manga of mine. I said sure and told him to follow me into my room so I could grab it for him. While I was crouched with my back to him looking for the one he wanted, I thought I heard someone whisper my name, but ignored it. I found the Manga and stood to hand it over to my friend when he suddenly jerked back, as if someone, or something, had shoved him. He stumbled a little and seemed super freaked out, but we both chose to ignore it.

""Here you go, give it back whenever you're done,"" I'd said just to break the silence. As we headed out of my room, with me in the lead, I heard my name again, only more clearly this time and then my friend slammed into me hard enough to make me fall to the floor.

""I'm sorry,"" he'd said, ""It wasn't me, someone keeps pushing me!"" Both of us freaked beyond belief, we booked it out of my house and walked for the longest time in silence. When we got to the first house and picked up my friend Joe, the conversation picked up again but my other friend, Josh, still wouldn't talk directly to me. He still hasn't said a word, but that night, I kept hearing my name repeated over and over until I finally got fed up and slept on the couch.

Why did whoever it was push my friend around? Anybody have any ideas? Advice is welcome because now I'm afraid for my friends.

My Old House,"California, United States",Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: My Old House

W hen I was about in 4th or 5th grade, people used to say that you seem to see ghosts when your young because you're so innocent inside. One day, my cousin tiffany was at work and I was left at home alone, like everyday, and I went to go use the bathroom and when I was done, I pulled up my pants and I saw a little girl! I saw her for 2 or 3 seconds, I was so freaked out! She had black short hair, she was wearing a long white gown with tiny flowers on them and I know for sure that it wasn't me!

I have long brown hair and I was taller than her, as soon as I saw her I ran out of the bathroom and jumped 2 stacks of stairs. A few days later, when I was left home again I was going to bed so I walked outside my door and turned off the hallway light as soon as I turned it off I heard a man say ""raylene"". I got so scared so I turned the light on again and ran inside my room and locked the door.

Another few days later, when I was left home again by myself, I was walking passed my cousin chris' door and the door just slammed, my eyes just popped wide open, I opened his door and the windows were shut.

I think about a month later I was left home again and I went over to my best friend shelby's house across the street, it already was dark and she asked me if I wanted to spend the night. My cousin always tells me to lock all the doors and turn off all the lights and before I went to shelby's, I turned off all the lights like I was supposed to and as soon as I was walking to my house I saw my cousins room light on and I didn't know what to do because she works an hour away from home and I knew she didn't go to the house and I did lock all the doors.

Shelby and I went inside my room and grabbed my bible and I found a prayer to bless my house and I read the prayer out loud and put holy water all over my room and ever since I did that nothing scary has happened. I'm so glad I moved and my aunt and cousins got a new house so now I live with my mom.

But the only thing that haunts me inside is the little girl in the mirror and the feeling of a person behind me whenever I walk up my stairs, I feel like their going to reappear, what should I do?

Ghost Girls in my Bedroom,United Kingdom,Apparitions / Voices / Touches,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Apparitions / Voices / Touches :: Ghost Girls in my Bedroom

I myself am very into ghosts and paranormal things and when I saw my first ghost, I was petrified. But as I began to see more and more ghosts, I became used to seeing them more often. The last time I saw a ghosts was last night, I have many ghost friends and they had never caused me any trouble before, but this ghost was completely MAD!

I have 2 dogs and they were sleeping next to me on my sofa in my living room. As I drifted to sleep, the room became really cold, unlike my usually warm house and my dogs began to whine. I could hear a horrible screeching sound coming from my bedroom which I had refused to sleep in because the paranormal activities was really bad in that room. The tv flicked channels, bed covers floated at great height and I could hear strange noises all the time.

So witnessing the screaming noises, I ran into my mum's room and asked her to come and see what was in my bedroom. My mum was a great believer of ghosts so she always believed me and was never scared at all. As I gripped the door handle, it was ice cold. I swung open the door and saw 2 little girls jumping up and down on my bed, they were screaming with excitement and seemed to be having fun. But when they saw us, they stopped bouncing and disappeared out of my window.

That was 4 months ago and we never saw them again. I hope there are lots of beds for them to jump on where ever they are now.

Black Silhouette,United Kingdom,Apparitions / Voices / Touches,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Apparitions / Voices / Touches :: Black Silhouette

T his isn't my story, it's my friend's. He's only 13, he lives with his mum, his two dogs and his two cats, and has experienced multiple paranormal activities. Only about a month ago, I was staying over at his house, I went in the kitchen to feed his dogs and cats when he shouted me in to the front room, ""one minute"" I replied, but he said it again ""come here quick"", he sounded terrified so I ran in to see what was wrong.

It was freezing cold in the front room (his mum likes the house really warm so this is really odd), I could even see my breath. My friend was as white as a ghost, ""what's up?"" I asked, ""you looked like you have seen a ghost"". ""I have"", he replied.

""Oh yeah whatever"", obviously I didn't believe him, but it was really cold and he looked terrified. All of a sudden, one of his dogs started barking so I went to see what was wrong and there was a black silhouette of a man standing next to the side door. I picked up a pan and approached the figure then it disappeared.

My friend has complained about feeling like his being choked, but no one is there, which I now believe him about. He really wants some advice on how to get rid of these or this spirits.

Tormented by a Poltergeist,United Kingdom,Poltergeists / Physical Manifestations,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Poltergeists / Physical Manifestations :: Tormented by a Poltergeist

T his wasn't one of my experiences, this actually happened to my nan and various other family members. In the past, my nan and granddad have had a lot of trouble caused by ""poltergeist"" activity, a few years ago my mum was at my nan's house getting my grandfather's dinner ready for when he came home from work because my nan was at work also at the time. She went into the cupboard to get a saucepan, they were on the bottom stacked up and they just flew out at her, there was no way they could have fallen off, they were stacked secure. After that, my mum sat in the chair in the living room waiting for the dinner to cook when she heard footsteps coming down the stairs, so she went to have a look to see if my granddad had come home from work early, there was no one there, puzzled, she went back into the front room. She then heard it again so she ran outside and waited until my granddad came home. Since then she would not stay in the house on her own.

My nan on the other hand had far worse things happen, one day she was in her house doing the washing up or something like that and she has china plates hanging on the wall above her fireplace. She turned round and a couple of them flew off like they had been thrown. She also saw the door knob turn on and door leading to the hallway and the door opened slowly then closed slowly, then the door on the other side of the room did the same opened and closed slowly, she felt a slight breeze as if someone had walked past her.

Another incident was when my granddad was in the bathroom, one morning with just trousers on, no shirt, and he felt ice cold hands fully touch him on the back. Obviously this made him jump and he ran downstairs to see if it was my nan messing about but when he asked her, she said she had been making breakfast the whole time. My nan, on a few other occasions along with my father and my uncle, both felt a pair of hands on their back and been pushed while at the top of the stairs, luckily they only fell a few steps but it could have been serious.

There used to be an old man that lived and died in my nan's house, when he got too old and ill to climb the stairs, they brought his bed downstairs into a separate sitting room. In his old bedroom upstairs, he used to spit tobacco up the walls, so sometimes when someone went up there or a relative stayed in that bedroom, you would be able to smell the tobacco or hear a keyboard playing in the sitting room downstairs, even keys jangling.

My nan used to have a clock up high on a unit in her living room, but one day she noticed something, a big crack right across the face had suddenly appeared in a distinct pattern, it kind of went from the bottom up then across then up again. Every clock she replaced it with did exactly the same thing, cracked in exactly the same place. After a whil, she got used to it but the strange thing is it only happened when someone was alone in the house or my nan and granddad were alone, I was too young at the time. She had milk bottles fly out off the shelf at her too.

One time, my nan had a fireplace brush that she kept on her windowsill for decoration, it was a black cast iron figurine of what I think was a tribal person with the bristles as its skirt sort of thing, it had an earring in both of its ears and one day my cousin was playing with it and pulled both the earrings out and lost them. Well, my nan just put it back on the windowsill, that was about head high when you sat on the sofa in front of it. My aunt came round a few days after my cousin (her son) had pulled the earrings out and was sitting on the sofa by it, the brush flew off the windowsill and hit my aunt in the head. Thankfully, it didn't cause any damage, after that, my mum had it since we had an open fire too but didn't get anything out of the ordinary so we assumed, after all, that had happened it was my nan's house, not the figure.

Well, all of these things, maybe a few more things I haven't been told about, kept on happening for about 12 to 15 years, it got that bad that my nan had gone to the local church and spoke to the priest there and asked for his help, so he came round to her house and went into every room with holy water and blessed it saying a prayer. Luckily it seemed to work, she still lives there now and since the priest helped and blessed the house it has been ghost free.

I have other stories to tell but maybe at a later date. Thank you all very much for taking the time to sit, be patient and read all this.

I also hope that some of you out there can take note of what my nan did to help you from an unwanted house guest! It really worked!

Floating Baby,"California, United States",Poltergeists / Physical Manifestations,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Poltergeists / Physical Manifestations :: Floating Baby

M y story may seem unbelievable but according to my parents, it's true. As I recall, the story goes a little bit like this. It was a nice typical day, my parents got home from the grocery store a little bit tired and decided to go to bed and rest. At this time, I was still an infant, about 8 months old. They put me on the bed with them in the middle to be exact. They laid there, just talking what married couples talk about.

Out of a sudden, my mother noticed out of the corner of her eyes that I was being lifted from the bed. At this moment, she assumed it was my father wanting to put me in my crib. As she turned to face him and tell him to just let me stay there, she was shocked at what she saw. According to her I was floating on top of the covers. No one was holding me up or anything. She immediately woke up my father who was on the other side of me sleeping and asked him if he saw what she was seeing at that moment. Both of them were still in shock of what was happening in front of their eyes. My mother then explained as she was seeing this, she didn't know exactly what to do and just opted to put her hand in between me and the bed covers to see if maybe it was a trick... As she moved her hand from side to side she saw that there was nothing absolutely nothing holding me up. Immediately, she grabbed me and put me against her chest.

I recall my parents telling me that they didn't know what happened that day but since then, they haven't found and explanation for it. They don't want to go in believing in sorcery but they haven't found any logical explanation for what happen. After I heard that story, sometimes I wonder that since little, I had something to do with this weird occurrences as for while I was growing up, I always saw things that I couldn't explain.

So what do you think? Is it just me or is there something out there following me?

Unknown Haunting,"Nebraska, United States",Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: Unknown Haunting

I 'll straight up say that I've never really been face to face with my ghosts, but I have heard and seen them and felt their presences. My house is about a generation old, I'm not to sure, but from the information I've gathered from the home-made Ouija board me and my friends made, I think a girl was murdered in this house a few years after it was built. She said her parents had had the house built in the late 1800s. I haven't really asked her, but I figured that the other ghost had killed her when he and she were alive. I also figured that he was hung for murdering her.

Now that I've given the brief description of my house's ghosts history, I can now tell you about my experiences with them. The first encounter was when I was walking by my loft's staircase. I've always felt a strange presence when I walk by the stairs, and one time when I was walking past the stairs, I looked up in reflex, like when you look at someone who walks into a room. To my surprise, at the top of the stairs was the figure of a person, no a person entirely, but a flowing outline that drifted in the corner of my vision, like when you stair at a bright light too long and I you see a the shape of the light stuck in your vision. From that time on, I knew my house was haunted.

The second encounter I had was almost a year later, of course between that time I had heard strange noises, like footsteps, in the basement, but other than that, there was really nothing significant. It was right about this time I started using the ouija board in my friends house, despite the warnings my friend and I were given by another friend. I was laying in my bed and slowly drifting asleep, slowly... slowly. I was almost completely asleep when suddenly I heard a shrill scream, coming from inside my ear! I knew no one else heard it, because of the stillness in the house. At the time, I was too tired to really consider it and went to sleep, when I woke up the next morning I realized what had happened. The voice was a girl's voice and it confused the heck out of me (I hadn't yet used the ouija board in my house yet).

Then, the very next night, I was actually asleep. I have no clue what I was dreaming of, or what time I woke up at, or even why I woke up. But for some reason I woke up and found this person, not a figure or a haze, a person floating across my bedroom. It was only for a split second, but that was long enough to take in a few details. It was a girl, I'm sure of it. She had light hair, maybe blonde, that reached down to her waist. She was facing away from me and seemed to be heading toward the door, maybe leaving. I didn't see any feet, but I saw the bottom of the dress she wore seemed to fade away. The sight was so amazing, I wasn't scared at all, I was more excited then really freaked out, even though I was. It took me forever to fall asleep after that, but eventually I did.

Finally, my last encounter with the ghost girl was last week when I was sick. I was sitting in the bathroom on the toilet. My mom was at work, the same with my step-dad. My sister was at school. After a while I heard the fridge turn on, but that wasn't it. I also heard the faint, yet high pitch, humming noises of a muffled voice. It was singing a tune I had never heard before, but it was so familiar. I was coming from my basement, my sister's room. I figured it was the girl from the other night and the screamer.

Then later that day, while I was sitting on the couch watching a movie, I heard a loud boom. Jumping a turned around to see what had happened, I thought it was the cat's knocking something off the table or something (not the cleanest house in the universe) so I went to go investigate. After taking a few steps I heard another boom. It was coming from the basement. It was so freaked out I was too afraid to go and investigate, so I just went back to the couch and sunk into my seat, hoping what ever it was wouldn't notice me. I knew it was any of the cats because one was sleeping on my lap, the other was sleeping on the other couch and the last was outside.

So that is all I have of my house's haunting. Sometimes I wish it were more, and something I wish it weren't at all, but still it's there and there's not use trying to deny it.

I have lived in my home 13 years, and I have done everything I can to live with these ghosts, but I don't think I can take much more, my friends say my personality changes when I'm home, things go flying across the room, footsteps are heard up and down the stairs in the hallway, and I learned to ignore them. I believe there are two men and one women and a child. I have video of them talking, but no one wants to help me, I have used sage, that keeps them away for awhile, but they come back, I have had visitors run from my house, everyone asks how can I stay here? I have no where else to go, no money, and this is my home and I am trying my best to stay here. I have hundreds of detailed encounters, one I will never forget was a few weeks ago, my minister from my church came over to pray with me, his name is Pastor Hafeman, and the living room became very cold, our hot coffee turned to cold coffee in seconds, when the minister was on his knees holding my hands and we were praying, this ghost or whatever this evil presence is in my home, pushed me back away from the minister, the minister said I'm not going to let go, hold on, and at the final words, I was weak, and shaking, but they didn't leave, I need some help here, or I will have to move. Please help!

Foot Steps,"Wisconsin, United States",Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: Foot Steps

I was about 12 and I was all alone in my house. My sister went to a friend's house, my parents were out and my grandparents were at a wedding in Green Bay. I was in my room on the internet searching around for good ghost stories to tell my friends.

I was in my bedroom which was at the end of the upstairs hallway next to the bathroom. If you walk out of my bedroom there is one right across from it which is a guest room and is always kept shut because one of our 3 cats likes to get in there and stay for days. Next to those two rooms at the end of the hallway is a bathroom which I don't use because I always find spiders in there. On the left side of my room is another room which is my sister's and left of the guest room is the office (I know this is boring but you need to know the house to understand the story).

After all of the rooms, there are the stairs which leads right to my grandparents bed room to the left, a bathroom to the right, and one of the two basements to the right just before the bathroom. Next to my grandparents bedroom is the living room and the kitchen is right next to that with the dining room through it. On the left of the dining room is the other basement which is where my parents room is, the laundry room, and 2 storage rooms. There are 2 doors in the dining room and one in the living room (which constantly stays locked).

Back to the story. Now I was in my room on the internet when I heard the doorbell ring. I went downstairs to the dining room and see who it is but no one is there. I locked the door again, checked the other 2 just to be sure and went back up to my room and started back with the internet. About 10 minutes later, I heard footsteps in the hallway right next to my room so I got up and looked to see if anyone was there. No one of course. So I went back to my room, thinking it's one of my cats. After about another 10 minutes, it starts again. Now I definitely knew these footsteps were like human footsteps, not cats. Once again I looked out my door and saw nothing. I looked to check the guest room and the door is open, feeling stupid, I checked to see if the cat had gotten in when I went in there earlier to get my sisters sleeping bag and thought I had probably left the door open. Nothing was in there though, so I closed the door and checked the bathroom. Nothing. I checked every room. Even the basements and nothing or nobody was there. All of my cats were in the basement near my room sleeping on the couch and that was all I saw.

I went back to my room and as I was going in my room, I noticed the guest room was open even though I had closed it. This kept happening to me all night while I was alone. I never saw anything or anyone. Something was there though, I could feel it in the air.

Every now and then, when I go to visit my grandparents (we moved from that house 2 years later but my grandparents stayed), I can hear footsteps and the guest room is always open.

My Friend Amy,"Illinois, United States",Psychic / Medium,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Psychic / Medium :: My Friend Amy

T his is true, think what you want, but it is. When I was 2, I lived in this old house from the 1900's, a married couple used to live there, but the husband killed his wife in the kitchen, I'm not getting into details, they were too gruesome. He then went into the garage and killed himself.

When I started walking I went into the kitchen and saw a lady (I call her Amy), she was cutting tomatoes, but then I saw her husband come in, he started chasing me, Amy tried to stop him. I ran to my grandpa and started crying. It scared me so I guess that's how I remember it.

These types of events kept happening, so I made friends with Amy, if something happened, she would protect me. I raced her up and down the hallways and jumped on the bed with her. But one day, she seemed angry, I couldn't hear her talk, I guess she was mute, I think her husband made her angry. My grandparents were laying down, Amy went in there, I followed, I asked what she was doing, my grandparents looked at me like I was crazy, Amy started shaking the dresser, I asked her to stop, she shook it harder, then she looked at me and stopped. I took her hand and walked out.

Afterward my grandparents found out the house was haunted. This kind of stuff kept happening, so we move out. I miss Amy I think about her all the time, and how she protected me.

Ghost Strangling,New Zealand,Old Hags / Night Attacks / Sleep Paralysis,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Old Hags / Night Attacks / Sleep Paralysis :: Ghost Strangling

W hen I was about nine years old, I remember waking in the early hours of the morning, about 3am, and was completely paralyzed. I was extremely hot and sweating all over. My room was in the attic of our house and I had my own staircase to my room, I knew something was coming up those stairs, and at my doorway, I suddenly saw a dark figure, it was a man's outline. I couldn't move and I couldn't scream either, he came closer and all of a sudden I felt my bed go down at the side, as if someone had sat down on it. I could see him next to me and his hand reached out to my throat, I couldn't breath and I remember screaming for my mother, but no words would come out. I began crying not only because of the pain, but also the fact I was trying so hard to speak or scream but nothing would come out. I became very hot and panicked as it lasted a good 3 minutes. I actually thought I was going to die. All of a sudden, it stopped and pulled away, it must have left. When I look back on it now, I believe someone must have interfered with the entity for it to have stopped suddenly like it did. Possibly one of my guardian angels or guides. I now feel very protected by them as it hasn't happened again.

What's interesting is around the same time, when I was about nine, I remember seeing a young soldier wearing a helmet and holding his rifle walk through my bedroom quite often, it could have quite possibly been the same man, or else my house was just very haunted!

W hen I was a child, we lived in a 2 bedroom apt. I was around 10 or 11 years old when this happened to me. Me and my mom and some of my sisters shared a room. When it was time to go to bed, we all would go to our rooms. We would fall asleep and this women would wake me up, she would talk to me, I really don't know what she said. I would try my best to get my mom up. I heard her say ""she can't hear you"". Then she would walk out of the room.

The next day I told my mom. It was getting where it was happening every night. I slept in the living room. I saw her pass me up and walk to the bedroom door, she looked, never said anything and walked out. She walked in our kitchen, I got up and walked over there and she went through our wall.

Well, the next day, my brothers pulled that wall down and there was a bedroom on the other side. My mom told the guy we were renting from. He told my mom a women passed away there. When we opened that up, I never saw her any more. Not much after that we moved out.

Mysterious Footsteps,Australia,Apparitions / Voices / Touches,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Apparitions / Voices / Touches :: Mysterious Footsteps

O ne morning, in 2005, when I woke up at 4:30am, I was very thirsty so I went to the kitchen and got myself a drink. It wasn't very dark, it was just starting to get light. So I didn't have to turn any lights on, everybody was still asleep with their doors shut. I made my way back to my room and just as I was entering my bedroom I heard a thud. Like somebody just jumped off something in the kitchen. I ran into my room and laid in my bed shaking as I heard footsteps up and down the corridor near my room, my door is in a way where if there's enough light (which there was) I can see down the corridor and the way my bed was at that time, I was in a position to see if anything was there. I stared at the door terrified I might see something. I could hear the footsteps up and down the corridor, it went on for ages, I eventually (still shaking) walked up to the shelf near my door and grabbed my metal CD holder, and walked out into the corridor, then the footsteps stopped. I called out ""if anybody is there please show yourself"" but in a much more shakey please don't show yourself way. When I decided what ever it was has gone, I turned and walked back into my room and as I turned my back to go into my room I felt this sudden feeling I was being watched, so I ran into my room, turned on the light and laid in my bed... I eventually went back to sleep.

Is Somebody in my House?,Australia,Apparitions / Voices / Touches,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Apparitions / Voices / Touches :: Is Somebody in my House?

T his is has happened twice, the most recent was Friday 27th of April 07 this year... But the first time happened last month. I'm usually home alone (since I dropped out of school), I took my dog outside for him to do his business and I was listening to my ipod. The song I was listening to had just stopped and I heard my front door open and close... My dog heard it to because he started barking, I thought ""oh it's mum or dad"", so I thought nothing of it, but because I hadn't done my chores, I realized if it was mum, I'm dead, if it's dad I'm still safe... So I walked through the garage to the front to see who it was by seeing the car and to my shock NO CAR! Which means somebody had entered my house! But both doors were supposed to be locked! I grabbed the rake from the garage and entered the house in the back way, I said loud and clearly ""I know you're here, come out"" I continued saying that while checking the house. I went to the front and the front door was open and the fly screen was shut... But both doors were shut and locked before! I continued to check the house, nothing was there, I know somebody/something was there because my dog started barking and I heard somebody come in!

The most recent one, as before, I'm home alone but this time I was in the house on my laptop on the other side of the house, I heard the fly screen and front door open, and then I heard a thud on the kitchen bench, like mum's bag usually does so I thought, oh mum is home! I wanted to show her something that I made on the laptop, so I walked through and nobody was there... Not even mum's bag! I walked to the front door and the front door was open and fly screen was shut... I grabbed the first item I saw which was an umbrella and checked all the rooms... Nobody was there.

No One Believes Me,United Kingdom,Psychic / Medium,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Psychic / Medium :: No One Believes Me

W hat I have seen is unexplainable and some people brand it as impossible. I was laying silently in my bed one night, everyone was asleep when all of a sudden I heard the loud footsteps coming from the hallway. Being used to my younger sister Ella, 8, getting up all the time, I went to see if she was wandering around so I could quietly take her back to bed. So I opened my bedroom door quietly and stepped into the hall way. I caught sight of Ella who was wearing a dressing gown that dragged along the wooden floor. I ran up the hall way and put my hand on her shoulder she was ice cold! And as I spun her around to see her face it wasn't her! I gasped as I stared at her long golden locks of hair and her spooky blue eyes. She gave me an evil look and slipped out of my grip and ran up the hallway and through the brick wall at the end.

I looked around in horror at what I had just seen and went back to bed feeling scared. I wasn't usually scared because I had been seeing ghosts since I was 6 years old but my family hadn't believed me and said it was just my imagination playing up. But I knew it was real.

One time I was sleeping at my nan's house and we were watching tv when my nan randomly whispered ""A secret between you and me Nicolle. I have seen ghosts too. And I believe you see them..."" Suddenly the tv flicked through channels and the lights flicked off and a shadowy figure stood by the doorway.

One night I was at my friend's house when we started talking about whether we believed in ghosts. My mates Tammie, Alice and Jade all said no but I said yes. They all wanted to do a Ouija board but I refused as my nan had told me not to because she had experienced many bad things due to the board. So they tried it and we ended up bringing some evil presence into the house. The light bulbs blew, the tables shook and we could hear someone screaming and a man's voice laugh. Tammie and Alice started to cry and went home scared to death but as it was jade's house, I said I would stay with her and she began to believe that ghosts existed. She told her parents that she had just seen the ghost wreck her bedroom and they believed her.

Since all of this my parents still don't believe me.  And I have written down how many ghosts I have seen within a month and it adds up to 13 ghosts. I would like it if anyone could tell me why the ghosts are attracted to me? And also, if this is normal to see so many ghosts in a month.

Zooming Shadow,Germany,Apparitions / Voices / Touches,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Apparitions / Voices / Touches :: Zooming Shadow

T his encounter happened when I was about 8 years old. My father was stationed in Germany (he's in the military). I had a lot of friends, my best one being Chris, who experienced this with me. It was about 8:30 PM, which was a little late for us to be outside, because we were young. We were just walking around, being bored. I kept seeing something black like a shadow zooming between buildings. I thought this was just my imagination, so it didn't bother me --that is, until Chris said, ""Hey, did you see that?"" I knew exactly what he meant by *that*.

Yet, this wasn't too freaky either, because there were bats in Germany, and there were pretty gosh darn fast. Sure, it seemed to be following us, but it still didn't really creep me out. This was getting from normal to creepy. I knew what I saw. I wasn't hallucinating, but I saw the same shadow IN BUILDINGS. We lived in housing, so there were apartments, and you could see inside the stairwells because the outside door was glass.

Chris said he had seen it inside buildings as well. This is when things got from creepy to run-away-right-now creepy. The shadow was still following us, I was sure of it. But we didn't stick around after seeing the black shadow zooming in the buildings. We ran into our stairwell (his apartment was above mine), and that was basically the end... Or so I thought...

To this day, I don't have an explanation of the shadow. We have shared the story to many others, but only some have believed us. The weird thing is, after Chris had moved and we were separated from each other, I have just kept on thinking that Chris has seen the zooming shadow again. I don't know why, I just do...

"Voices, Bangs, and Sheets Pulled Off",Canada,Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: Voices, Bangs, and Sheets Pulled Off

I was in my bedroom sleeping about 6 months ago, and I woke up hearing voices in my room. I was so creeped out but yet... I sat up and slowly walked to the light switch and flicked it on and off about 3 times. The voices didn't stop. But the thing that scared me most was they were talking about the bad things I have done, or lied about (not that I have many times or anything). I walked to the door, to go to my mom's room when this deep man's voice said ""Where are you going!"" and I was like ...AH! And I ran to my mom's room. Then the voices stopped.

Another time, I was just about to wake up someone pulled my sheets off and hit my light cover and made a big BANG and it fell off (that was SOOO scary!).

And another time was when I had a sleep over with my friend Avalon, we heard a huge bang in the basement so I ran to my room. And then later that night when we were in my room, we heard it again. The bang sounded like metal hitting metal. Really weird. Then it came up the hallway and it was making bangs outside my bedroom door. And the weirdest part of all these stories... They only happened to me in my room.

Phone Call From Beyond,"Virginia, United States",Family / Friends Visits,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Family / Friends Visits :: Phone Call From Beyond

I had a friend, Carol, who was dying of cancer. Her husband called to tell me she was in hospice - meaning the end was very close. I couldn't go to visit her because my car was out of commission, and also because I knew that I'd cry and Carol wouldn't like that. So I just stayed home and cried off and on all day. I didn't accomplish much of anything.

Late in the day, I suddenly experienced a lightness of mood. I felt that my life was SO BEAUTIFUL and wonderful! And my family so nice, that if I failed to cook (as I had) I could just order out for pizza. So I did. While we were eating the pizza, the phone rang. It was Carol's husband telling me she had died late in the afternoon (around the time my mood had lifted). I got all weepy again and stayed that way all evening.

At bedtime I went to bed and, although I have NEVER done this before nor since, I picked up a crystal that I had on my nightstand and fell asleep with it in my right hand. Then I dreamed that the phone on my nightstand rang, and I picked it up and said, ""Hello?""

""Hello,"" said the voice on the phone. ""This is Carol. I just wanted to let you know that I'm dead, and I'm fine. So bye..."" Carol's voice had the same slightly raspy, rapid, definite, almost angry sound that it had in life.

But I apparently realized that this was weird, and woke up suddenly. When I did, I noticed that the ""phone"" receiver in my hand was the crystal with which I'd fallen asleep. Most people will say that this was just a dream, but I have to say that it didn't feel like an ordinary dream at all.

My Paranormal Troubles,"Connecticut, United States",Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: My Paranormal Troubles

I called my house phone from my cell to play around and see what I sounded like on the phone. As stupid as it was, I picked my phone up and a strange loud laughing came from my cell which was on speaker. I called my younger sister for help and ran out the room. We were home alone (this actually just happened 10 minutes ago from me posting this and I came across this site looking for tip on how to protect yourself from a ghost) and this is not my only paranormal encounter.

My house was built by my great grandfather and was a boarding house and many people have passed away here. How will I learn to adapt? I mean, I do always hear walking and creaking up in the attic, which no one has been up there in ages. My house is haunted but I think this stuff comes with me too because I've always been visited by ghosts in my dreams in my old apartment building. If you have and explanation please leave a post or contact me at Milliascool [at] yahoo [dot] com.

Please help, maybe I should just suck it up and live with it like many have.

The Rage,"Minnesota, United States",Poltergeists / Physical Manifestations,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Poltergeists / Physical Manifestations :: The Rage

B efore I tell my story, I want to give you a little background on my family history... Starting with my mom. Just to save myself some typing, I'll tell you the blunt part of it: She dreams things and they come true... Never good things, but the fact that a lot of the stuff happens is well, creepy. My mom and I have long believed that this ""gift"" has been passed through her side of the family (she always told me stories of my grandpa having really crazy stuff happen to him) and that it is very very real. Well, one day me and my mom got into a HUGE fight and I ended up in my room alone crying, pacing and in more emotional pain then I've ever been in. I was looking in my mirror crying when I heard a ""POP"" noise (it sounded like someone dropped a light bulb). I knew something had happened. I started by inspecting the mirror I was looking into, nothing had happened to it. When I walked around my room I found my glass tray had broken into pieces! And I'm most definitely telling you it was some thick glass. Without thinking twice, I ran into the kitchen where my mom was and started screaming about how she broke my tray... She had no idea what I was talking about.

A lot of my friends have came up to me throughout the years and have said ""man that stuff that happens to you is so cool! I wish something like that would happen to me"" and let me tell everyone out there reading this there is nothing cool about being haunted and if you seen half of what I have, you would probably go crazy.

Thanks for reading anyway though, I really hope someone in the future will learn or prosper from this story in some way. To anyone else out there that's haunted also and need someone to talk to who are in the same shoes, email me chilli6969 [at] hotmail [dot] com.

Our Ghostly Experiences,"Arizona, United States",Misc,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Misc :: Our Ghostly Experiences

M any of my friends and I have had ghostly experiences. Some have had more than others, but we've all got a pretty scary story to tell.

My cat died a few years ago. He was very old, and very needy. He needed to be fed so often, that I had to feed him during the night. He took to scratching on my bedroom door with his paw to wake me up. A few days after he died, I began to hear this scratching once more. It sounded just like him. Every once in a while, I heard him Meow as well. But, as I was very sleepy, I would go to feed him, as in my normal routine. When I opened the door, he was not there.

Carol's family has a history of paranormal. Her mother, who worked a job at a warehouse when she was younger, saw a woman dressed in white in the stockroom. Carol's cousin sees dead people, just like The Sixth Sense... She often sees her dead uncle in her room.

There are two teachers that have told me some stories. One teacher taught me a few years ago, and she told me this story about her and her friend when they were kids. She was sleeping over at her friend's house. They slept on the two couches in the living room. They were opposite each other, with a coffee table in between. On the table was the remote to the TV, which had been left on. All of a sudden, the two girls were woken up by the sound of the TV being turned up very loud, and back down again. They looked at the remote, and the little knob was being turned back and forth.

In that same house, they said that the old guest room that they never used was haunted. The door was always shut, and they heard noises from inside. They had countless exterminators come in to see if there were raccoons or something, but there were never any rodents or anything.

My other teacher's granddaughter says that her grandmother's house is haunted. She says that she's heard crying in the bedroom, and the bathroom door will never stay shut. She was sleeping in the bedroom one day, and she was expecting her uncle to come to the house. He was to go there, and then to the hospital to visit a friend. Early in the morning, a man walked into her room. She thought it was the uncle. ""Are you going to the hospital now?"" she asked him. He nodded. An hour later, she was up, and she called her grandmother, who was at the hospital. ""Is uncle Frank there yet?"" (The hospital was very close to the house.) ""No, of course not. He's still driving to Phoenix..."" They still don't know who came into the room at night.

My school's pre-school is also haunted. Some of the teachers stay late and work. It's said (by many of the teachers) that they hear giggling from the bathroom and closet. This is when every child is gone, FOR SURE.

Linda and some friends were playing hide-and-seek (for some reason) and she was going to try to hide in her garage. When she walked inside it, she looked around the corner, and she saw a man dressed in an old-fashioned suit, and had a medallion (or something) around his neck. Linda screamed and ran inside. When her parents came home, she told them, and they all went into the garage. Sitting in the corner was a folded suit, a medallion sitting on top.

A Stranger,"New Mexico, United States",Apparitions / Voices / Touches,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Apparitions / Voices / Touches :: A Stranger

I was twelve when I first saw a guy. I was walking out of the church and I glanced over to my mom's office. There was a guy standing there. He had dark hair and was wearing a white shirt, black pants. And a black top hat. When I looked again he was gone. I told my mom what I saw and she didn't know what to say. Now four years down the road, after I turned 16, I was in my bed room changing for bed time. My mom was in the living room watching tv. I looked over at the bathroom and there he was. This time I got more details. He's 6'00 / 6'3, short black hair, top hat, white shirt with ruffles, black pants, and black boots. I started screaming ""because I was half naked"", my mom came running in to see what happened. I told her I saw a guy in the bath room. She took me into the living room and she calmed me down. She said no one was in the house. Then she took me through the whole house to show me no one was there. We started talking about it. And my mom says he's probably a guardian angel.

There's this other guy. When I was in the kitchen, I grabbed the jug of water and set it on the counter. I reached for a glass and set it down by the jug. Then all of a suddenly, the lid flew off and hit the ceiling and landed next to the jug. It scared me, I felt like someone was watching me and I turned around. He has blonde hair, blue eyes. He's wearing a confederate uniform. And just standing there like I know him. I don't know why I did what I did next but it helped. I said: ""I don't know who you are or why your here, you're welcome to stay, but please don't scare me any more..."" He just said sorry and faded out.

He still shows up every now and then but he doesn't seem to mean any harm.

Behind the Curtain,"Missouri, United States",Old Hags / Night Attacks / Sleep Paralysis,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Old Hags / Night Attacks / Sleep Paralysis :: Behind the Curtain

A t an age of around 6, my brother and I used to make a pallet on the floor in a room that was air-conditioned anytime we couldn't stand the heat. Every time that I slept in this room, I would have recurring nightmares of something standing behind one of the rooms large curtains looking down at me. It was long enough ago that I couldn't begin to tell you what it looked like other than it was human in appearance and that it would scare me awake. Each time being woke by the nightmare, I would find myself unable to move.

One such night, I was awoke by my brother's cries from this same nightmare. When I finally got up I found that my mother was comforting him as he was vomiting in the bathroom stool due to some illness. I was told to go back to bed and as I laid back down I saw, behind the curtain, the figure from my dream point at me and say without speaking ""You're mine"". Immediately both sides of my pallet flew up around me. Scared half to death I screamed ""NO"" and hit the sides of my pallet with my fist until the unseen force holding it gave way. When I looked back to the curtain the figure was gone.

I'm not sure at which age I learned of demons, demonic spirits, good and evil but to this day the closest thing I could compare the figure and the feeling of doom to would be of something demonic. Not just in its appearance, but in what I know now to be that feeling of evil. For the longest time, I have put if off as all just a bad dream until recently, my brother was telling me of sleeping in this room, waking and being unable to move.

My Son,"Kentucky, United States",Children Who See Spirits,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Children Who See Spirits :: My Son

W hen my son was 5 years old, we lived in a trailer park. He would come to us and tell us he saw this old woman in his bedroom. And my girl was in the kitchen cooking when a spoon she had just laid down moved. She ran and told us. She never saw anything, but things would happen to her. One night, my sister came to see us, she looked very worried, I asked her what was wrong, she said ""sis there is an old women in your kitchen, she's looking at me"". There were 3 people seen with her or she was picking on one. I let my son sleep in the living room one night and he came and got me out of bed, he said ""mom that old women need to talk to you"". I said ""who?"". I told him I didn't see her.

Well, one night we were looking at my pictures, he said ""there! the women I saw!"". It was my granny, she passed away a while back. I asked my sister if that's who she saw, she said ""no, that women was ok with us being there, she loved the kids, but she doesn't like it when other come over"". I really don't understand why this happen to them. I have always seen things. But I never saw her.  She never tried to hurt no one.

I think she was there looking after us. I told my son he was ok, she wanted a friend and she picked him.

House Built in 1860 with Three Ghosts,United Kingdom,Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: House Built in 1860 with Three Ghosts

I moved into my flat back in January of this year, there are 3 flats situated in this house that was built in 1860, my boyfriend lives in the middle flat, between my flat and his, there are 2 small sets of stairs and a small landing area with a window in between. When I first moved in, my boyfriend told me that the house was haunted by 3 ghosts, we have researched the house and its previous owners and we believe that the resident ghosts are part of the first family that owned the house when it was first built. These ghost are said to be most active between the 3rd and 16th of May for which reasons we don't know. That's something I have to look forward to.

But here's what we have already experienced and the reasons for thinking they are all part of the same family. Sometimes we see a man stand near the window, he is dressed in Victorian attire and he has a sad look on his face, he seems harmless and sometimes we speak to him, we think that, because of his attire, this is a Mr Langbourne that is said to have died in 1922. There is also sometimes the laughter of a child that can be heard in the hallway. Mr Langbourne had a daughter that died when she was 7, the girl is also sometimes seen with a lady in a maids uniform, we think this may have been one of the Langbournes' servants.

The house was the last of a row of terraced houses and back in its day, it was a rather wealthy family's house. The road as it is now used to be called Piano Lane as all the houses had a piano in the front room (which is my front room now). When we sleep upstairs in my boyfriend's place, we can hear a piano playing faintly downstairs.

Other things such as electrical equipment disturbances, things disappearing then showing up where you last left it, footsteps in the early hours in the hallway and knocking on the walls, phone receivers being taken off the hook when we are in bed and heavy objects being knocked over, these things seem to happen more when we discuss the spirits, possibly just them letting us know there are there.

All the spirits seem kind enough but the man on the stairs seems very sad, he may need to move on. It is very close to the 3rd of May and already the activity is picking up.

The Old Man and the Young Boy,"New York, United States",Misc,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Misc :: The Old Man and the Young Boy

T his is true. My brother and I are being followed by a ghost each. At Long Island (our summer house), my brother was climbing a ladder to his bunk bed. The ladder fell back... And I felt a gush of wind and the dresser he was going to hit (it also would have paralyzed him) suddenly shot back, and I saw into the blue eyes of an 8 year old boy. I saw him for 3 seconds then he left.

At my real home, I got into a fight with this kid at school, he pulled a knife out, and then, out of no where, a dead bird fell on his head. I ran home and sat on the couch, then heard the radio that was unplugged repeat the same line from the stalker song by the Police... It kept repeating ""I'll be watching you"".

Another day, I was on the toilet, and I saw the curtains rustle, and inside, there was a man in my tub, looking at me saying ""I'll protect you"". The curtains closed, then opened again, and then he was gone. I haven't been hurt yet, but the little boy keeps scaring me, grabbing my feet from under my bed, making my dolls walk to me. The old man will whack him with his cane, but I don't know.

M y girl and husband were going somewhere the other day, but as they were going in the door, they heard someone say ""hello"". They both looked and no one was there. We all experience this a lot, we hear someone talking or saying our name and when we say ""yea?"" or ""what do you want?"" no one is there. Or we can hear like one of our voices and we will go in there and see what the other want and they say ""I never said anything"". Do you think that it a ghost trying to talk to us?

One day, me and my kids were gone, my husband was the only one home and he said he heard me say his name and to get up. He said he got up and went and looked and no one was there. One night, my girl was taking a bath and she heard someone say turn the water off. I don't know why we are hearing these things call our name, say ""hi"", or if it's just us. But it very funny that it is happening to us all.

Can anyone tell me anything about this? Our cats will look at the walls like they see things. They will be laying down asleep and just get up and run and play.

"Sleep Paralysis, Demons and Angels",United Kingdom,Old Hags / Night Attacks / Sleep Paralysis,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Old Hags / Night Attacks / Sleep Paralysis :: Sleep Paralysis, Demons and Angels

I had my first sleep paralysis when I was 13 in my bedroom at my old house. I was dreaming at first, which I can't remember. I woke up hearing a young boy voice saying ""hello nea nea"". I tried to move but I only moved like 1mm, then returned the way I were, like I am tied up with rubber. I was laying on my right, then everything went white, then I felt like some one was a top of me and a voice repeated ""hello nea nea"". Again, everything went white, then I saw a person at my side  with the back of his head facing me with a piece of long hair covered with blood on his head. Again a voice repeated. That piece of hair was moving, I was frightened. After I woke up, I could feel my heart beating. It was very weird.

The second time happened in the same place, but a month later. I woke up and I was floating with a old zombie look a like man in my face singing with weird words like ""ba du awww"" something like that. I could talk, telling it leave me alone, and close my eyes, it lasted like 30 secs or longer. I was very frightened.

The weirdest thing was a week after, I woke up in middle of the night and saw someone who is black with a white suit on and he disappeared. My mum has seen him as well, he woke my mum up by pushing her into the bed, then walked into my room and shouted ""get out of jason's room"" (she saw many ghost in her past) but I didn't hear her, she must have been asleep again when I woke up. I was scared but I felt I knew that he some kind of an angel.

After that, we moved to a different house, I was 15 at that time. It happened again, with something appearing at my door but I closed my eyes, so instead I felt someone at the top of me, making love, which it was very weird, I am male! After I woke up confused.

A week later again, but this time nothin happened, I only heard the ocean, I thought that I was dying so I said ""I don't want to die yet, why now?"". After that, I woke up.

Two days later, again, I was facing my blue wall at the left. I saw a face appearing and smiling at me. I didn't feel scared, just cheerful, relaxed. After 30 sec, I woke up feeling happy and never had another one again.

Was it an angel that have stopped demons from attacking me? was it a test for something, or did I made someone or something bored of attacking by closing my eyes? IS it just all in my head? But it can't be in my head since I saw someone at my old house. It's so weird!

If sleep paralysis happens to you, try to close your eyes and think of something like what to do today or something.

The Brookdale Lodge Haunting Investigation: Santa Cruz Mountains,"California, United States",Ghost Hunting,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Ghost Hunting :: The Brookdale Lodge Haunting Investigation: Santa Cruz Mountains

R emember the movie ""The Lost Boys"" and the camera spans the surroundings of Santa Cruz? While your looking at an odd mixture of Santa Cruzians, the song from the Doors plays... ""People are Strange"". Well, I will explain why I thought the people of Santa Cruz were strange later on in this article. But, for right now, let me tell you the date of this event.

It's Saturday, April 21, 2007. I'm sitting at home relaxing, waiting on H.P.I. (Haunted and Paranormal Investigations) of Northern California's - paranormal investigator Michele Stump. Michele is driving me to Brookdale, California, a small community of the larger city of Santa Cruz. We will be staying at the world famous Brookdale Lodge. This is the place where Al Capone and other assorted gangsters would vacation. Many celebrities of the past frequented this establishment such as, Marilyn Monroe, President Herbert Hoover, and Mae West. The Brookdale Lodge was featured on Unsolved Mysteries, because of the little ghostly girl by the creek named ""Sarah"". Yep! The Brookdale Lodge is haunted. Some psychics say, by 49 ghosts! Ross Eric Gibson - author of ""Historical Memories Haunt

Brookdale"" says: ""a girl in a formal dress runs across the lobby, then disappears into thin air... hidden rooms and secret passages are mysterious vestiges of Brookdale Lodge's rich past."" 1870 is the year that the Brookdale Lodge came into existence. I will discuss the Brookdale Lodge more as we get further into this article.

For right now, let me tell you a story that Michele told me on our drive to Santa Cruz. I asked Michele how she got interested in the paranormal and this is what she had to say:

""When I was 8 years old, I lived on the Forni Ranch in the Sugarloaf area of El Dorado County. The ranch was haunted. I came to realize that, when my brother was thrown off his bed. One time there was no electricity in the house, I was bored, so I built a card house. I used a deck of playing cards and something mysteriously knocked it over. I used to hear footsteps, glasses clanking, and upstairs there was always laughter. Of course there was no explanation for these noises, because there was no living human being around, just me. One day, an entity walked past me and ran up the stairs and slammed the door. I would hide in the barn until my family returned, I was so scared. I believe the entity was ""Old Man Forni"" who died at this ranch. The entity would tip over kerosene lamps and when we moved from the ranch, the ranch finally caught fire and everyone thought that ""Old Man Forni"" did it.""

Finally, Michele and I arrive at the Brookdale Lodge, she played ""Rush"", ""The Police"", ""Primus"" and ""The Rolling Stones"" on the car stereo to get us primed for what was to come. I was all rocked out by a ""Bohemian Rhapsody"" by the time I reached the Lodge. When we arrived we went through registration and then straight to the buffet. I had lasagna, coffee, apple pie and cheese cake while we listened to all of the presentations. The Northern California Paranormal Conference was awesome! The itinerary included: Gloria Young of ""Ghost Trackers"", Shannon McCabe & Alicia Perry of ""H.P.I. Paranormal"", Nancy Bradley - world renowned psychic and trance medium, Robert Reppert - owner and head investigator for ""Gold Rush Ghosts Investigations"" Robert Reppert showed us some of his million dollars worth of ghost hunting equipment. Gave us some good tips, such as how he tries to disprove a haunting and when there is nothing left to dispel, then it only leaves the abnormal or paranormal.

As I surveyed the crowd, some of the paranormal investigators I recognized, or was able to meet this day were sitting around intensely listening to Nancy Bradley and the other speakers. Douglas Carnahan, President & Lead Investigator for N.P.I. (Nor Cal Paranormal Investigations), Jennifer and Anthony Baca; Shane Thornton, Lead Investigator of N.P.I., Carol Gillis of H.P.I., Tim Hawkins of H.P.I., Brian Colbert of H.P.I. Mary Casiano of H.P.I., Anne Temple, a psychic medium, Jonathan Russell and Kristen Sheley, Researcher for H.P.I. There were about 75 other guests, but I didn't get the chance to meet them all, we were so busy with the conference activities.

I did get the chance to interview Elayne Higbee who works the front counter of the Brookdale Lodge. She said, once, a woman customer approached her with major excitement because she had taken a photo of her spouse. Behind her spouse was a full figure apparition of a man! When they took the photo no one was around.

At MRA Fine Arts (MRAfinearts.com) - aka ""Gallery That and Gallery This"", I interviewed the artist, Martha Applegate, and her close friend Jesus L. Galvan. Jesus told me he once saw ""Sarah"" (the little girl that drowned in the creek that runs through the Brookroom of the Broodale Lodge) run past him at the Lodge's bar. He told me that Al Capone and other assorted gangsters would stay at the lodge, and at times the gangsters would have secret meetings in secret hidden rooms of the lodge. While they conducted these secret meetings, sometimes someone would be murdered! According to folklore, they buried the murder victims underneath the flooring of the Brookdale Lodge. He goes on to say that there were whiskey stills nearby also, and he heard that some of the other unlucky gangsters of the Brookdale were buried in unmarked graves in the surrounding mountain areas. Jesus says that once, when he was in the woods near the Brookdale, he came upon some ghostly apparitions of a Vietnamese or other Asian family. Martha and Jesus discussed that at the art gallery a customer walked in and was looking at Martha's gorgeous paintings. She discussed one of the paintings with the person next to her, only to see that person dissipate into nothingness. This freaked her out and she ran out of the art gallery horrified! Jesus even says it has been reported that there are ghostly mountain pumas in the mountaneous areas near Brookdale. After hearing all of these stories from Jesus and Martha, Michele and I decided to check out some of the local restaurants. We stopped at Tyrolean Inn Restaurant & Beer Garden (www.tyroleaninn.com). Wow! Delicious looking food but we couldn't get a table. We happened to see Shannon McCabe, President of H.P.I. Paranormal and conference organizer, there having dinner with some of the other H.P.I.'ers. They were dining on German food and some awesome looking ""hard"" coffees. The restaurant looked pretty elegant, too rich for my blood! Tyrolean Inn restaurant is located in Ben Lomond.

Finally, we found a restaurant we could get a table at, this was Don Quixote, they serve delicious Mexican food.

We enjoyed a live band called ""Extra Large"" that was playing Latin tunes such as ""Mambo Jambo"". I had an enchilada and burned my face off with some salsa.  Michele and I found other H.P.I. team members at this restaurant and we talked about the conference and the upcoming ghost hunt of the Brookdale Lodge.

When Michele and I arrived back to the Brookdale Lodge, we met up with everyone at the Log Cabin. This cabin was a large wooden cabin, attached to the Brookdale with a huge roaring fire place. Nancy Bradley was there greeting us and lead us in a spooky seance. Nancy described various spirits in the cabin and what they were doing. I shook hands with Nancy, she was a very humble, sweet lady with a gracious smile. During the seance with Nancy Bradley, a pretty girl named, Maria Eivers, started shaking and crying. She looked incredibly distressed. She claimed that she felt a feeling of total sadness in the log cabin, and that she could not control herself. Was she actually feeling someone's pain? Shannon McCabe and Carol Gillis quickly took her out of the Log Cabin for some fresh air. Nancy Bradley said that two brothers, the Clayton brothers, who died in a car accident haunt this cabin along with a few other entities. She could feel the Clayton Brothers presence. Roger Reynolds, security for the Brookdale Lodge, was with us in the seance and told me that he has seen ""Sarah"" in the front lobby, Fireside Room, and the Brook Room. He says that every once in a while the entities of the hotel turn the power and lights on and off. We experienced the heater turnining itself on in the Brookroom during the ghost hunt later that night. He also says that the infamous drowning victim ""Sarah"" is actually Sarah Johnson, age9 years old, who died on July 1, 1936.

After the seance, the band at the hotel started playing some rock and roll, they jammed to the song ""Elvira"". The crowd was a mixture of Bohemian culture with hippie mix. If you think there are no more hippies in California, just head out to Santa Cruz, this is where you will find them. A strange assortment of dancers with strange outfits and strange hairdos. This is where I thought of the Doors song...""People are Strange"", it was something I had not experienced before, something out of a movie! After a while of hanging around I discovered these folks were not strange at all though.. they were quite cool.

Michele and I went to Cherie Vincent's hotel room, room 42, and played with her Ouija Board. Cherie has 2 small rose tattoos on her neck, they were once vampire bite tattoos. Cherie often uses the Ouija Board and had her sage ready to dispel any demonic entities. We said a prayer before commencing on the Ouija Board. We tuned into a child of the hotel that spelled out the word ""die"" on the Ouija Board.   Cherie gave me ""Directions on how to use the Ouija Board"" material to read over, too bad I didn't read this before I started playing!

When Michele and I left Cherie's room, I was greeted by Shane Thornton of N.P.I. He told me that N.P.I. found some good evidence, one of their members felt a spiderweb touch on their body, yet there was no spider web in sight. They captured orbs and what looked like miniaturized lightning strikes on film, including flashes of light. One photo depicts a whitish mist. Strange.

The ""official"" ghost hunt began when the band ended their set. We went from room to room and captured all kinds of orbs on our photos. One rather impressive photo was captured by Kristen Sheley, a researcher & photography expert for H.P.I. Paranormal. She captured a fast moving solid white orb on her photo at 1:55 a.m. The photo shows very good details of this moving orb. And none of the expert investigators could dispell it. Some investigators heard laughter in the Brook Room and a couple of investigators heard a ghostly voice say 'shhh'. Michele and I discovered many secret passages that we investigated on our own, including a burned out area of the hotel. The fire damage came from a 1956 fire. At 2:45 a.m. my cell phone (which was fully charged) died out for no apparent reason during the investigation. Shannon McCabe tells me that it is common for batteries to drain during investigations because entities ""draw"" energy from wherever they can, sometimes leading to a dead cell phone. Bummer.

On this night, there were ghost hunters, bikers, Bohemian/hippies at the hotel. What an assorted mix of people from all walks of life. On one hotel door, there was a hanging stuffed bat. A strange place indeed!

Sunday morning, I saw the largest black raven land on the balcony of the hotel where I was staying. At 3:34 a.m. in Michele's hotel room, 3 faint knocks on the bedside cabinets were heard. Michele's room was room 45, next to Room 46, the well-known haunted room that an Australian couple was brave enough to stay in.

When we awoke, Michele and I had breakfast at Brookdale Cafe and Grill. I enjoyed pancakes, cheese & ham omelet, coffee and hashbrowns. I was nice, refreshing and not strange. I was full and ready for my trip back to Sacramento, CA. How nice, Michele is driving and I can take a snooze on the way home. What's that? I have to be the navigator...sigh. At least Sunday was a nice day, because Saturday night it downpoured rain. A nasty storm for an incredible ghost hunt!

Choking Ghost,"Illinois, United States",Apparitions / Voices / Touches,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Apparitions / Voices / Touches :: Choking Ghost

M y name is Hillary. I am 14 years old. When I was around 12 years old, I lived in illinois. One day at school, my friends in gym class noticed a huge bruise on my neck that I didn't see until then. They said it looked like a hand. So I put my hand up to it and it was the same exact size (but I would have known if I choked myself). So I was kind of freaked out. Then the next day, I was at my home by myself, and I thought my mother called my name. So I yelled ""yes mom"", no answer, so I said it again... still no answer, so I went in the back room and no one was there. It turned out my mother was next door at my grandma's. Then I heard something in a nasty, scariest voice you can think of (kind of like the exorcist voice), it said my name... And I ran outside!

Then the next day, I saw a foot out of nowhere, and it headed towards my mom's bed. I was scared out of my mind. I couldn't speak, I just ran!

Now I am not experiencing any more ghosts since I moved to my father's home. But my little sister is 5 years old and she always says she sees a monster in her room. Is it possible that my sister is the next one that THING will haunt? HELP ME PLEASE!

Lady in my Room,"Virginia, United States",Apparitions / Voices / Touches,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Apparitions / Voices / Touches :: Lady in my Room

H ello my name is brittany and I'm telling you about about a frightening ghost encounter I had at my dad's house when I was 10. I was at my dad's house and I was sleeping. But I woke up in the middle of the night because I had to go to the bathroom extremely bad. I was scared to get up because of other encounters at my dad's house (yes more than one), I heard my step mom get up and go to the bathroom so at least I felt safe! And right after she was done, I went. Then I came back relieved (believe me) and climbed up on my bed (bunk beds). It was hot because it was the summer so I covered up with one small thin blanket. I had this weird feeling I'd had more than once. I looked down and there was this lady in the middle of my room walking around in circles like she was trying to get away from something or someone and didn't know what to do. I was so scared I put my head under the blanket and said a little prayer. Then I heard someone coming up my bunk bed ladder (because it wasn't bolted in, and it shook when you walked up it) and for a split second, it was so cold that I had to get under my blanket. Boy was I scared!

A Warning and the Baby's Ghost,"New York, United States",Family / Friends Visits,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Family / Friends Visits :: A Warning and the Baby's Ghost

T his story has two parts, and I have to tell both, or the second wouldn't make sense. They involve my adult cousins. My cousin, Jen, is married and has two kids. Her husband's name is Tom and her kids' names are Tommy, 6, and Diana, 4.

My first story takes place about a year ago. One night, Tom and Jen has just put their kids to bed. When they first bought their house, it had two bedrooms, but then they had Tommy, then Diana, so they built a bedroom in their attic. The steps lead to their bedroom, which is the only room upstairs. Jen was sleeping, and Tom was just falling asleep. Their bed faces the door, and Tom had the feeling he was being watched. He opened his eyes and his mom was standing by the door... But that made no sense... His mom was dead... He got up, and walked towards the door. When he reached it, two things happened; his mom disappeared, and he smelled smoke. Immediately, he opened the door and headed downstairs. It turns out their dishwasher was broken and had started to smoke and catch fire. If their ""visitor"" hadn't arrived, their home would have burned.

The next story takes place much more recently. My Uncle John (Tommy and Diana's grandpa) says Diana, my younger cousin, refuses to enter her room without the TV on. When they ask why not, she always says, ""IT is there!"" and points to a corner in her wall. It's a blank corner nowhere near her closet, with no posters or toys or borders on it. She points higher to the ceiling. At night, she doesn't go to sleep alone without the TV on, and then, when her parents turn the TV off, she comes back up in their room.

I'm not really sure what could be bothering Diana, but my family and I have a somewhat strong belief in ghosts. What do you think?

Great Grandma Felt Much Better After Death,"Illinois, United States",Family / Friends Visits,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Family / Friends Visits :: Great Grandma Felt Much Better After Death

T his is really my mother's story, but she's told it to me over and over, so I know it well. This took place in Mulberry Grove, Illinois. My mother was named after her own grandma and loved her very much (she was my great-grandma, obviously, though I never knew her. This happened before I was born). While mom was in high school, great-grandma became very ill with a tumor in her abdomen. This happened in the 1930s when medicine was not so advanced, so basically they just called it ""a lump"". It may have been cancer. Every day, my mom would rush home from school to take care of her grandma, smooth her pillow, give her a drink of water, and sit with her. Great-grandma was being cared for in my mom's bed in the home of one of her daughters (there were six of them!), since she was so sick.

Eventually great-grandma died, of course. After a couple of days my mom began to sleep in her own bed again -- the one great-grandma had died in. One morning, she awoke and saw great-grandma floating in the room above the floor. With her hand on her belly, she spoke and said, ""See, Evie, the lump is gone and I feel so much better now!"" Then she disappeared (Evalina was the name of both of them).

My mother is still alive and as sharp as two tacks at the age of 86, and would tell me the same story in a heartbeat if I ask her about it. And no, she is NOT flaky nor prone to a lot of visions in general.

Entity Doing as I Say,"Wisconsin, United States",Misc,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Misc :: Entity Doing as I Say

A t one point in my life I have said ""I don't believe in ghosts..."" Well I will never say that again based on my experiences. If you care, here is how my stories started! One day my friend and I were on the internet and saw this random ghost proof video. Now that I look back on it the video was totally fake, but that was what got us into ghosts. So we went to the park to get our minds off the ""shocking"" evidence we had just found of ghosts. We went to the baseball field, she walked up the stairs to the room where the announcers sit (or something like that) and said she saw a child in a floral shirt wearing glasses but that was really all she could see of her.

I went to the park every weekend in summer with my best friend, gradually we almost stopped going to the park because fall was coming, and the cool Wisconsin wind blew hard almost every day. One day we randomly decided to go to the park. That is when I decided, ""hey, no one is here. I have been watching these ghost hunting videos, let's find a ghost. It will be fun!"". It wasn't exactly fun but I know I will never forget it.

We asked for a sign of their presence, suddenly the wind drastically picked up speed. At that point I didn't think anything actually happened. But then we moved on to asking other signs such as I asked ""them"" to come with me, across the park. I guess it did because I whispered to them ""to hold my friend's hands in a ball and not let go until I asked, even so I couldn't open them"". I came back by her and she was yelling at me ""what did you do I can't open my hands they are in fists. Help!"" I tried to open them and I couldn't, then I remembered and wispered ""Ok that's enough!"" her hands opened. We then returned to my house.

The next morning I woke up, ate breakfast, and walked to the door way in my room. It was empty, as usual, I didn't share a room. For some reason I had just stopped at my doorway and examined my room I started looking to the left, I saw my blinds moving as if someone was running their finger down them. I gasped then it stopped, it was not my imagination.

During the middle of winter, she invited me over to clean (how fun I know but everything we did together was fun). We just had finished when I was running down the hallway, I knew she wasn't there but her little dog was chasing me so I went directly to her room. Something was moving that caught my eye the water in her glass was swirling. Once again I gasped and it slowed down.

Nothing really happened for a while, until the next spring. I went to her house to play DDR. We then started playing game cube, her dad offered to hook it up upstairs since we were downstairs, then he left us home alone. We were in the living room playing a racing game (I was losing as usual) and she told me she felt a tug on her hair. Later I felt it. We asked for a sign of ""their"" presence. Then I turned around because I heard something and I saw a floating black mist type figure. I was totally freaked out. But like 10 minutes later, we went on with the game as if nothing happened. She got scared but I was not, I was excited.

I have had so many little things happen, I tried to put them in the correct times but I am not sure how correct it is. Do you think I experienced a ghost?

Not So Friendly Ghosts,"Louisiana, United States",Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: Not So Friendly Ghosts

W hen I was a few months old my family moved from Texas into a beautiful home in Louisiana. It was out in the country, and there were few houses that were close to us. At first we were just renting it, but the man that owned it later sold it to us because the house went into bankruptcy.

As far as I'm concerned there was a baby and a mother. At night my dad used to watch tv late. Sometimes he would hear me cry (or so he thought), so he would go check on me. It seemed to come from the other side of the house, but as soon as he would reach the hall it would stop. Figuring I just stopped crying, he would come make sure I was okay, but when he looked closely there were no signs that I had been crying. It happened more than once, and I was never the one crying. He would try to sneak to my room, but there were always the same results. Sometimes I would even be sleeping in my mom's room, or not even home. It still always seemed to come from that side of the house, and it was a baby crying... A young girl (my room and the hall was a whole different house that was moved to that location many years ago. A doctor bought the house and added on to it).

When I was maybe three or four my dad started working overseas, so there was only my mom, me, my brother, and my sister (both teenagers).

My sister's boyfriend would sometimes stay at our house. My mom moved me to the other side of the house in her room because I was terrified to sleep in my room. I always felt that something was watching me and I was also scared of the staircase -which I could clearly see from my door. My mom would offer William to sleep in my room, but he refused. No matter what, he would sleep on the couch.

I loved to draw when I was little, and I still do, so we would put all of my drawings at the bottom of my closet. One day he finally told my mom that the reason he wouldn't sleep in my room was because one night he woke up and heard papers being moved. He got up and went into my room and saw papers floating in the air and being tossed to the side as if they were being looked through. Not only that, I had numerous wind up toys and a laughing phone that would wind up in the night. The little girl loved to play with my toys!

One night I had a dream that the little girl was my best friend, but no matter what, we would always play by the staircase and in my room. She refused to go anywhere else.

After a while my brother and my sister moved out, so there was only me (a young girl), my mom, the ghost mom, and the ghost daughter (which also seemed to be a young girl).

I know there is a mom because, one day, my mom was going upstairs to clean my brother's room, and a lady in a long brown dress was standing on the staircase blocking her way upstairs. Also, one night I woke up to a creaking noise that was coming from my mom's room. When I walked into her room the rocking chair was rocking back and forth, and when I went to see if the window was open in case the wind was blowing... It wasn't... And there was an indention in the chair... As if somebody was sitting in it. Like the mother was rocking her baby to sleep.

When I was in first grade we moved to Grand Isle, but we would come to the house on the weekends. Since we left it was never the same. When we would come home no matter what we did, it was cold (we even got a fireplace installed... We would come home and it had gotten so cold that our plates were cracked and my fish had died), and the house had a weird feeling to it. I missed the house, but I for some reason I just couldn't stay in it when we came to visit. I would ALWAYS go to a friend's house.

One night I had a dream. My mom and I were outside and all of a sudden three men came up to us and tried to kill us. They looked Chinese or Vietnamese. In my dream our yard was a sugarcane field (our house is actually built on what used to be a sugarcane field). The men made a box, and it seemed very important to them. Everything was a sugarcane field -except for our driveway and a tree. The three men killed my mom and I and buried the box next to the tree, the one on the side of our driveway. I know what tree it was in real life but we moved before I ever thought about digging there.

My mom and I were talking one day, and all of a sudden she said that one night she woke up to what seemed to be a horrible fight. It came from the other side of the house -yet it seemed like it was happening right in front of her. From what she remembers there was three men yelling and screaming... Killing the mother and daughter... Just like in my dream, except it wasn't my mom and I. Whatever the men were screaming the K in the language was mostly what was heard. She pictured three men of a vietnamese type... I had NEVER spoken to her about the dream before.

People that came to our house would hear whispering, see shadows, and they would also hear my toys being played with. They all said that it was coming from my room or the staircase. They knew the house was haunted, but if they were making up stories, how would they know that things usually only happened by my room?

At first my mom and I thought they were just two innocent little ghosts, but our minds were changed. As soon as my mom got the idea to get the house blessed and look up the history of the house, our lives were turned upside down. We were FORCED by my dad to sell the house, and many other things went wrong! When my mom and I thought about everything that had happened over the years, we began to realize maybe we were wrong about the ghosts all along. Where they ever really nice? There was always bugs and snakes in and around the house no matter what. No matter what, it was cold, nobody wanted to stay, they moved out refusing to stay... Everybody except for me and my mom... Doesn't it just seem a little weird that there was a mother and daughter ghost... And me and my mom were the longest people to stay in the house?

We finally moved and our lives seemed so much better. Even thought it was a beautiful house and will never live in one like it again, my mom and I have found a nice town in southern louisiana, and were just fine without a nice fancy house... I guess money really can't buy happiness.

Seriously Bad Dream,"California, United States",Old Hags / Night Attacks / Sleep Paralysis,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Old Hags / Night Attacks / Sleep Paralysis :: Seriously Bad Dream

I 'm not really sure if I was experiencing a ghost when this happened, but maybe someone can help me figure out what did exactly happen. This was about two months ago and it started out as a horrible dream. I dreamed that I was with my family and we were about to get into a car to drive somewhere. I don't know where, but from what I remember of my dream, I don't think I wanted to go because I jumped out of the car from the back window in defiance of my dad's orders. The next thing I know, it was like we were at the scene of an accident, even though no one was hurt and there was no accident.

The police were there talking to my family and I was off to the side away from them, wrapped in a blanket. I started to run away and my dad started to chase after me, and for some reason I knew he wanted to kill me. Now it was just him and me running. I was able to get pretty far while he was chasing me but all the sudden, I began to run slower and slower, like I was running in sand, until I was barely running at all. Then he turned the corner and came right up to me with a knife in hand. He stabbed me in the stomach and then pulled it out. Then he stabbed me again in the shoulder but instead of pulling the knife out he dragged it up from my shoulder across my throat, like a diagonal line from my left shoulder to the top right hand corner of my throat, but when it reached my neck I was completely aware of the dream.

I just couldn't wake up. I could hear and feel myself choking and gagging and I felt the knife dragging through my throat. It was so real. Every bone the knife crossed I felt it crack. I wanted to scream so badly, so that someone might here me and come fully wake me, so I tried with all my might to scream as loud as I could. It finally worked and a piercing scream escaped me. My eyes were wide open at this point. I stared at the ceiling for a few seconds out of fear and shock.

Then I tried to get up but it felt like something heavy was on top of me and I couldn't move. I felt myself trying to move but I wasn't. It didn't feel like I was paralyzed. It felt like a force was holding me down. After awhile I was able to move again and I was so scared to look around my room because I felt like something was there, so I just pulled the covers over my head as tightly as possible and went back to sleep.

When I slept I had another dream. Only I thought it was real because in my dream I woke up and told my mom about the dream I just had. Then my friend came over because we walk to school together in the morning. She was in my room and I was in bed, and her eyes turned black and her face changed. She looked so evil. She started taunting me about the dream I just had and I realized it wasn't her voice at all. In my dream I knew she was a demon disguised as my friend, and the demon was tormenting me with my dreams. Again I woke from the dream in another dream if that make sense.

This kept happening through the whole night. I thought I was never going to wake up, that I would be trapped in an endless dream. When I finally did, my mother came into the room angry because she said she came in to wake me up before, and that I was going to be late for school. I start crying because I didn't know if I was still dreaming or not. I get chills whenever I think about it. I have never been so scared in my life. I felt terrified

Before that night I had never really had a bad dream. It wasn't just scary, it was evil. I don't think I ever want to feel that way again. If you can help explain it to me, I would much appreciate it.

Startling Knocks At My Window,"South Carolina, United States",Misc,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Misc :: Startling Knocks At My Window

I have a habit of being awake in the wee hours of the morning on a fairly regular basis. This particular morning I was up late working on some music projects. I had my earbuds in listening to a track when suddenly I heard 3 loud rapid knocks right at the window behind my bed's headboard.

It scared the living s#!+ out of me! Startled, I snatched out my earbuds and laid low for a brief moment wondering who in the h*! Could be knocking on my window at this time of the morning. This has never happened before so I'm there ducked down trying to process what just happened.

In those brief moments my mind is racing and I thought for a second could it have been one of my household relatives that went outside and perhaps locked themselves out? Then I thought could it be someone from around the neighborhood up to no good or perhaps needing something?

Then I thought that maybe I was hearing things, but the knocking was LOUD and I actually felt the THUD of the window. That's actually what got my attention, and it was loud enough that I heard it beyond my earbuds.

I quickly jumped out of bed and grabbed my pistol. I then slowly peeped out the blinds of the window to see if anyone was out there but oddly there was no one there.

That side of the house is well lit by a nearby street light and my car was right there next to that window. Still peeping out the window I looked around the car and waited to see if maybe someone was hiding behind it on the other side, but I didn't see anyone. I angled my gaze downward to see if anyone might have ducked down below the window alongside the house but no one was in sight.

I then went out of my bedroom and slowly peaked around the corner into the front room to see if by chance anyone else was awake and happened to make a loud noise which I thought was at the window, but came from another part of the house instead. However, I saw that they were all sound asleep, snoring loudly.

I then peaked out the blinds in the front room (where my relatives were sleeping) to look out in the yard but I saw no one in the yard. If someone were to flee it would've took them a few minutes to get far enough to exit the yard, and they would've been well in view of the street light.

I went back in my bedroom and looked at the clock on my laptop. I saw it was 2:48, right before 3am (which is said to be ""Witching Hour""). At this point I'm on edge and starting to think that it may have been something paranormal happening.

For the sake of protection I burned some sage and told whatever it was to leave me alone and return where it came from.

I laid back down in bed on edge for the remainder of the morning until daybreak, but nothing else ever did happen.

The following night came and I again, was awake in the wee hours. Naturally I was on edge waiting for something to happen again but nothing ever did.

Rumor Or Real?,Japan,Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: Rumor Or Real?

T here is a small Japanese-style washoku restaurant I sometimes go to. It is an old place with a wooden sign and a sliding door. Inside the floor is covered with tatami, the tables are low, and the smell of grilled fish and dashi hangs in the air. The menu is fixed, with set meals of rice, miso soup, simmered vegetables, pickles, and fish.

People in the neighborhood have spoken about the place for years. They say that if you stay there too late, unusual things begin to happen. I never believed it until one night I went there with my friend.

It was close to closing time. The dining room was empty except for us. The waitress came to take our orders, bowed politely, and walked quickly down the corridor toward the kitchen. Her footsteps echoed unnaturally against the floor.

While we waited, the light above our table flickered. We both looked up, then shrugged it off. A few minutes later, a clatter broke the silence. A pair of chopsticks had fallen onto the tatami from the table next to ours. The strange thing was that no one had been sitting there.

Not long after, I felt a tap on my shoulder. It was light, like the touch of a waiter. I turned, but no one was there. When I looked forward again, the waitress was just then coming out of the kitchen, carrying our trays with both hands.

We ate quietly. The food was the same as always, but the silence of the room pressed down on us. After the last orders were served, the kitchen lights went out. I heard the faint sound of pans being stacked, and then there was nothing.

Suddenly a loud crash echoed from the kitchen. A pan had fallen to the floor. No one moved and no one spoke. The kitchen remained dark.

When the waitress returned with the bill, she said nothing about it. She bowed as usual, but I noticed her hand shaking slightly.

We paid quickly and left. As the sliding door closed behind us, the light above the entrance flickered once.

Later I tried to learn more about the rumors. I discovered that about fifty years ago, the owner of the restaurant had a violent quarrel with his wife. He struck her, not realizing she was pregnant. The baby was lost. The woman's mind gave way after that. Some time later she killed him in the restaurant's kitchen.

It is said that the man still lingers in the dining room, and the woman remains in the kitchen, waiting for the one who took her child.

When I think back to the tap on my shoulder and the chopsticks falling from the empty table, I cannot help wondering which one of them it was...

"Did They Fade, Or Do They Remain?",Japan,Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: Did They Fade, Or Do They Remain?

I live in Hokkaido, and my yard used to have an old well. It had been there long before I moved in, tucked away behind shrubs and an aging shed. I rarely used it, maybe only only once in a while for watering plants? But otherwise it sat quietly, almost forgotten.

The area where I live has long had a reputation for being haunted. Over the years I've grown used to it. Sometimes, in the middle of the night, faint voices can be heard, like distant prayers carried on the wind. They've weakened as time has passed, and I've come to accept them as part of the atmosphere here.

But what happened when I arranged to close the well felt entirely different.

In the days leading up to the ceremony, strange things began to occur. At night, dogs from far-off homes barked and howled in the direction of my property, though there was nothing visible in the yard. Inside my own house, I would wake to muffled knocking sounds, low and insistent, as though coming from beneath the ground.

The night before the priest was due to arrive, I saw something I still can't explain. At dusk, I noticed a shape near the well. At first it looked like an animal crouched close to the ground, but as I focused on it, the form seemed to stretch upward, taking on the blurred outline of a person. It never came into focus... Always shadowy, indistinct... Before vanishing altogether. When I went to check, the ground around the stones was damp, though it hadn't rained in days.

On the morning of the ceremony, the air in the yard felt unusually heavy, as though the place itself was holding its breath. The priest performed the purification, but later admitted it had been harder than usual, as if something resisted the prayers.

When the ritual was finished and the well was sealed, the disturbances ceased. The dogs grew quiet, the knocking sounds never returned, and I haven't seen that shadowy figure again.

Even so, the memory lingers. The distant prayers that sometimes drift through my area feel familiar now, almost harmless. But the things I experienced during the well-closing were different... Very active, immediate, and unsettling in a way I won't soon forget.

Do you think the spirits tied to the well are still here, or did they fade away like the voices of those midnight prayers?

A Haunted Well,India,Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: A Haunted Well

"" This is something that happened to my mother around 45 - 50 years ago...""

During her childhood, my mother used to spend her summer holidays in a small village called Naginenipally, at her eldest sister-in-law's house. Like most children of her age, she was playful, curious, and a little adventurous.

In that village, there was an old well that everyone whispered about. The elders often warned children to stay away from it, saying it was haunted. Naturally, this only fueled the curiosity of the kids.

One day, when all the elders were busy with work, my mother and her close friend slipped away to see the well for themselves. They played around it for some time. Neither of them knew how to swim, so they never dared to get too close. But then something terrifying happened.

Out of nowhere, a woman draped in a black saree appeared. She was carrying burning coal wrapped in her saree, yet the cloth did not catch fire. With a swift motion, she threw the burning coal in front of the children. Shocked and terrified, the two girls ran back to the house, trembling with fear.

Days later, despite the incident, their curiosity got the better of them. They returned to the well. But this time, what they experienced was even more chilling.

From deep inside the well, they began to hear a voice calling out the name of my mother's friend. At first faint, it grew louder and louder, echoing through the air until it felt unbearably close.

The girls fled in horror. That very night, my mother's friend developed a high fever. Even as she lay in her home, she claimed to hear the same voice calling her name again and again.

Though her fever eventually subsided, she never recovered from the fear. Within a few days... She passed away.

I Would Have Been Late,Canada,Family / Friends Visits,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Family / Friends Visits :: I Would Have Been Late

M y Mother passed away in April 2022, though I have been thinking to share the interesting events that happened around that trying time, today I'm going to write about a little help she gave me this morning.

Today I had to go to work to a place a bit far from where I live and one of my coworkers was to pick me up at 6:00 AM.

Since this is way too early for the time I usually get up, I decided to sleep in my daughter's bedroom so not to disturb my husband's sleep. I prepared my stuff and a good lunch and set the alarm with enough time to let me get ready, have a good breakfast and tend to the cat's needs before leaving, I thought one hour and 20 minutes would be enough time to do everything without rushing.

Anyway, at some point I had a dream, perhaps even a nightmare, in which I was going to get together with my friends from university, they arrived at my place and I wasn't ready. I began looking for something to wear but couldn't find anything suitable, mismatched socks, flowery blouses and plaid skirts and homely dresses that would had made me look like a pauper beside my elegantly dressed friends.

I went out and told my friends that I'd be ready in two minutes, but was moving with the speed of a snail and knew I would make everyone else late for whatever event we were attending.

My parents were watching me from the background, and Mom said ""Se te va a hacer tarde"" (You are going to be late).

Hearing her voice was enough to wake me up startled, I checked my phone, it was 4:23 AM, still a bit earlier than the time I had set the alarm. I stayed few more minutes in bed but decided to turn off the alarm and get up. To my horror, I realized that I had set the alarm at 5:40 AM instead of 4:40 as I had intended!

Strange Voices In The Mountains,Japan,Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: Strange Voices In The Mountains

I went camping for two nights at a small site up in the mountains, next to a slow-moving stream. The water ran clear over stones, and deer wandered through the area occasionally, which is normal in Hokkaido. The air smelled damp and earthy, with a faint hint of pine.

I rode up on my side-car. The road was quiet, and the forest on either side felt still, but the ride itself was normal.

The first night was uneventful. I heard only the stream, the occasional rustle of leaves, and a few distant birds.

The second night was different. I woke sometime after midnight because the forest felt unusually still. The stream was quieter, and then I heard voices.

At first, they were faint, blending with the water. But it was clear they were human voices, not animal sounds. One voice, soft and high-pitched, sounded like a woman speaking in short, broken phrases. It drifted slowly through the area, fading in and out. I stayed still and listened. After a few minutes, the voices faded completely, leaving only the stream.

When I was leaving the next morning, I mentioned it to the caretaker. He didn't look surprised. He said quietly that people sometimes hear things in that part of the mountain, and that in the past, a few people have gone missing there. He didn't give any details, and I didn't ask.

I don't know what I heard that night. Maybe it was someone lost, maybe it was just the way sound carries in the forest. But the voices by the stream have stayed with me. What do you think those voices are? Are they victims or some sort of night creatures?

"Move To San Francisco, A Very Haunted City","California, United States",Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: Move To San Francisco, A Very Haunted City

O oookay, I was totally joking at the end of my last post when I said I'd post again in five years. But here it is, five years later. Looks like I'm going to be unintentionally posting every five years on here.

On 29 June 2021, I moved to San Francisco. It's where I'd always wanted to move, but couldn't for various reasons. Well, a really good friend of mine told me that I could live with them. They lived with their family and their family said I could stay until the end of the year, then I'd have to find my own place. That seemed perfectly fair.

In 2017, their grandmother passed away. I always assumed she passed away in the hospital because I remembered my friend telling me they rushed her to the hospital, and a few days later they told me she passed. But every time I was by the bathroom in front of her old room, I'd get this strange feeling there was a presence. That little hallway had that feeling. It didn't feel evil or scary, it actually felt calming. I told my friend, and they said, ""That's Baachan. She's watching over us"". My friend is Japanese and that's the term they call their grandmother. I asked if she passed in the hospital like I thought, and they said, ""No, she hated it there. We brought her home to rest in her own bed, and she passed away that night"".

However, the basement was another story. Or rather... First floor? Basements are weird here in San Francisco. In their house and the one I'm currently living, there are steps leading to second floor, which acts as the first floor. The ground floor is considered a basement even though it's fully above ground. I've lived here four years, and I'm still confused by it. I live on the third floor but it's technically the second floor...

Anyway, we had to go to the basement to do laundry. We never liked being down there because the air felt thick and evil. My friend's family had bought the house back in the 1950s and their mother had grown up in it, and she told me it was like that when she was a little girl. She hated being down there and doesn't go down there unless she has to. I asked if something happened down there and she said if it did it was before her family bought the house, but it definitely feels like some really bad energy is down there.

So, I got a job there, saved up and moved into my current house on 5 January 2022. I'm renting a room in a house, and it's a really nice neighbourhood in the Richmond. That's not doxing myself, the Richmond is fifty blocks long and like ten blocks wide. It's a very big area.

It didn't take me long to notice that the house was haunted. At least the hallway. Even in the daytime I feel like something is chasing me when I walk down it and I rush back to my room. A friend of mine looked up this address on SF Chronicles archives and found out there had been a murder here in the '80s. There weren't any specific details like if it was in the top floor hallway or something. But that's the only thing we found that could explain it.

There are four rooms on my floor. My room is at the end of the hall facing the outside. I look out my window and see the street. The room next to mine, there was someone living there when I moved out. He moved out a year into me living here and someone else moved in, he's still here. The room at the end of the hall, the same person has lived there since before I moved in. I mention all this to talk about the last room. I call it the middle room even though there are four rooms. I guess it'd be the middle room in that hall, since mine is at the end of the hall. Anyway, I've always called it the cursed room. The guy who was living there when I moved in moved out a month later. In the three and a half years I've lived in this house, we've had six different people move in and out. The short time was two weeks. I came home from work and he was moving his stuff out. I asked what was going on and he just said, ""I can't do this anymore"". I asked what he meant and he just repeated it. The current tenant there seems to be paranoid. When he moved in a couple months ago, he told me that he had to move out of his last place because his landlord was having the tenants spy on him. I was like, ""Oh, that's messed up!"". But then he started talking about hidden cameras in his room and I felt like maybe his last landlord didn't have him spied on. A couple weeks ago I was coming up the stairs from taking out the trash. His room is directly in front of the stairs, and as I was nearing the top, he opened his door and told me I needed to stop standing outside his door listening in. I was confused and he said, ""Don't bother denying it, I caught you three times"". The other way I was coming up the stairs from talking with a friend at the front door who had come to pick up something. As I was nearing the top he threw open his door and startled me. I laughed and told him he startled me. He goes, ""I told you to stay out of my room! You need to leave me alone!"". Honestly, I don't know if that has anything to do with the activity here or if he's just mentally ill, but I honestly wouldn't be surprised if there was a presence outside his room and he thinks it's one of us.

Something happened a couple of days ago that made me want to write all this down. Our bathroom is split between two rooms. Okay, from my room looking down the hall, on the left side are my roommates' rooms. On the left side is an empty closet, the stairs, and the two bathroom doors, and the kitchen at the end of the hall. The first bathroom is literally just the toilet, the size of a porta-potty. Really tiny. The second door is the shower and sink. It sounds inconvenient, but with four people living there, it's been very convenient. Anyway, a couple days ago I was in the first bathroom and I could hear someone taking a shower. I could see the light on, and the windows were open and I could very clearly hear the shower going. I was thinking to myself, ""I'll just wash my hands in the kitchen"", like we usually do in that situation. Well, I leave the bathroom, the sound still going and light still on through the window, and when I close the door behind me... The second bathroom door is open, and the light is off and no one is in there. No shower going, the floor and walls are dry. I stood there, my blood frozen. It was seriously eerie.

Okay, that's enough about my living haunting situations. I'll talk about my San Francisco working haunting situations. That's a weird wording, but I'm going to keep it.

First job I got was on Fisherman's Wharf at a souvenir shop standing outside going, ""Everything is $10!"". That was literally my entire job. That's the job that paid for me to move out of my friend's house. But a week after I moved into this house, the store abruptly closed. I frantically looked for another one and was lucky enough to find one with one day left in the month. My landlord is very understanding. It was an organic market on Polk, and I loved it there. A lot of the friends I have made here were either coworkers there or regular customers there. A minor celebrity was a regular there and she and I talked every week. It was so much fun working there! Even if it was haunted like crazy! There was the obvious stuff like stuff falling off shelves that weren't near the edge, stuff moving around or not where we left them. There were times we saw figures cross between aisles even though we knew no one else was in the store. I even had a similar experience that happened in Ohio. A coworker and I were discussing the hauntings, and a loaf of bread flew off the shelf and hit the counter. We decided to change the subject. The same thing happened in Ohio except it was a bag of chips.

In 2023 the store was bought by another, bigger store and closed down and we were all let go. I had saved up thousands of dollars by then, which was lucky because that paid my rent until I got another job in March 2024. My current job, in fact. I'm a photographer at a landmark. Obviously not going to say which one. We take pictures of guests as they enter and try to sell them souvenir sets of their photos as they leave. We all know the area is haunted, but it's hard to prove because we're outside. We just know mostly because we can feel it. There were two incidents that really solidified it, though. Several months ago, I opened up (I'm a lead there) and when I unlocked the office there were photo cards everywhere. I called the person who closed the night before and asked them what the heck happened. He was completely confused; it wasn't like that when he left. I knew he was lying so I had to report it to my district manager. An hour later she texted me a video showing that... It wasn't him. Oh, the photo cards are cards with QR codes we scan when we take the pictures and hand to the guests. There are 1,000 in each box. Anyway, there was an open box on the table in the office and in the middle of the night, they started flying out of the box of their own accord. I asked her if I could share the video and she said absolutely not. What's with corporate not wanting these things getting out? Honestly, I think that'd give us more visitors.

The other thing that happened was we often hear our names called from behind the sales area. There will be no one over there and one of us will hear our name being called from back there. No one else can hear it, but almost all of us have heard it. Even the skeptical ones have heard it, though they have tried to dismiss it as the wind. But it even happens when the wind isn't blowing, or even no breeze. The air could be still and we'll still hear it. It's always eerie. I've been working there for a year and a half and have heard it many times and am not used to it. We had a sixteen-year-old girl start working there last year. I was standing next to her on her first night and she suddenly screamed. I jumped and asked what happened. She said, ""I heard someone saying my name!"" and she ran behind the sales area and screamed again because no one was back there. I involuntarily laughed and said, ""Oh, you'll get used to that"", even though like I said I'm still not used to it. Needless to say, she quit after about a week. She said it was because she hated working outside, though.

I'm going to end this by talking about something nobody likes talking about. I've walked the Golden Gate Bridge so many times now that I don't even take pictures every time anymore. It's just a large bridge that just happens to be one of the most famous in the world. No big deal. But as I'm sure everyone knows, it's well-known for the unfortunately high number of people who have jumped off of it over the course of its existence. I don't know if you've walked on it, but you can definitely feel it when you're walking on it. There's an air of sadness when you're walking across it. No matter what I'm doing, be it listening to happy music or in a call with my best friend, there's an unmistakable feeling of sadness, dread, and regret when walking on that bridge. I've never specifically seen anything, but I think it's because I'm kind of sensitive to that sort of thing that I feel it so much. I've walked it with a friend of mine once who isn't sensitive to the paranormal and she didn't feel anything. Heck, at this point, I don't even know if what I feel on the bridge is even paranormal anymore. There's been so many jumpers over the past century, those emotions are essentially baked in by now. They have nets in place now so there have been less attempts lately. Someone did jump a couple months ago. I saw him lying on the net refusing help. Last I saw, they were guiding him off. So, the nets are definitely saving lives. Either as a deterrent or by literally catching people who try.

Is Someone Visiting?,"Texas, United States",Family / Friends Visits,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Family / Friends Visits :: Is Someone Visiting?

I t has been a VERY LONG time since I have visited YGS and had someone not reached out to me via FB I am not sure I would have returned, but here I am and a BIG thank you to the individual who reached out to me.

2024 was not a good year for myself or Family. In January we saw the passing of my Mother. Her health had been in decline (heart issues) and was in assisted living in the Dallas Tx area. In May we received the 'midnight' phone call that wakes you from your peace. My Oldest Son (Lawrence) had collapsed at work, he worked 3rd shift (overnights) at a Local Floor and Decor, and was pronounced dead at the scene. He had suffered a Bi-lateral pulmonary embolism. My Father -in-Law, who's health was failing (Type 1 Diabetes Complications) moved in us in June, by the first week of August he was placed on Home Hospice and passed away later that same month (yes, he passed in my house).

In the year since, some 'odd' things have happened either to individuals in the household or with-in the house itself.

1st: When home alone I hear someone moving upstairs in my Son's old room. I 'played' it off as it being our dog (a 13-14 year old 50-60 pound Huskey with a bad hip) only to realize he was at my feet as I sat on the couch. A quick 'cat check' shows that both of out cats are also in the living room with me.

2nd: Each Family member has felt Lawrence's presence at one time or another, up to and including hearing his voice saying something... Not sure if this is just us remembering how he would speak with us or if he is actually interacting with us still, but it's defiantly his 'sarcastic' / snarky type comments.

3rd: Not sure how people feel about seeing individuals that have crossed over in their dreams, but my Wife has had two very vivid dreams about Lawrence, she describes them as 'feeling' real. The first one he was comforting her because he had passed away, he assured her that 'he was needed' on the other side... The next day is when we received the coroner's report detailing what had caused his death... A pulmonary embolism, is enough to take someone, he had suffered a Bi-Lateral (one in both Lungs) Pulmonary Embolism and there was nothing that could have been done to prevent it. The other dream she described was 'just as real' but he was simply comforting her, at least that's all she could remember about it.

So, there it is... 2024 was a very rough year for our Family, still dealing with so, so many things from last year, but making progress. Thanks for reading.

Am I Losing The Plot?,United Kingdom,Misc,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Misc :: Am I Losing The Plot?

A t the end of May this year, I lost my umbrella. This fact had me very confused as I do not use my umbrella very much, and usually use it to walk to the gym when it's raining. Just as info, I have zero psychic ability. None. But I have been reading stories on YGS for over 10 years as I find the subject interesting.

I looked everywhere for this umbrella. I live in a Victorian terrace with limited space so there are a finite number of places to look. I even went to my car and checked in there. On the back seat of my car, behind the driver, I keep two cloth shopping bags and I moved them out of the way to look at the back seat (even though I can't imagine why I would put it on the back seat) but I saw nothing. Each week these 2 bags would be used and returned to the same spot. Shortly before I was due to go on holiday the 3rd week of June, I returned my bags to the back seat and there sat my umbrella. I was quite nonplussed. I was sure that I had carefully looked at the back seat weeks before. I park as close to my front door as I am able because parking is first come first served.

I got back from my holiday, and on June 3rd I was making something to eat, and reached into a lower cupboard for a can of baked beans. I always have baked beans - they are a staple. My hand grabbed air. I bent down to have a look, stuck my hand into the space where there should have been cans, put my arm all the way to the back and zilch. No beans. I was really surprised that I had run out as I hate running out of anything. Next day when I did some shopping I bought a couple of cans to go in the cupboard. When I tried to insert the new cans I heard a clink. I looked into the cupboard and there were two cans of beans there. As you can imagine, I was beginning to wonder if I was losing the plot.

On the 10th of July (and this is where I went back and wrote dates down) I took a bus to meet someone for coffee in a town about 3 miles away. While I was on the bus I looked at my hands and noticed that I had not put on my rings and bangle. A few months ago I realized that I really should wear my jewelery more as it was silly to leave it in the jewelry box, so I had two rings resized and started wearing them more. The only problem is that at times the rings and bangle get really annoying. When home, I often put them on my computer desk and put them on from there before I go out. If they annoy me when I am out I pull them off, and slip them into the front zip pocket of my shoulder bag. I thought about when I had last seen the jewelry and could not remember seeing the pieces by the pc before I left, so I thought that perhaps I had forgotten to take them out of my handbag after the last time I wore them. I unzipped the front pouch, which is probably about 25cm x 20cm, slid my hand back and forth and resolved to look for the rings and bangle when I got home as the pocket was empty. Had my coffee, got on the bus to go home and started to put my bus pass into the front zip pocket. As soon as I slipped my hand in, I felt my bangle which is gold and fairly heavy and noticeable, and the rings were there too.

After the beans incident I had started to wonder if I had a spirit in my home with me, and the jewelry incident really reinforced that thought except for one thing. I was a couple of miles from home when I found the empty pocket, and about 3 miles away from home when I could feel my stuff again. And this is where I really started to wonder if I was losing it. How did ""my"" spirit know that I would be looking for my jewelry on the bus, and how did it put it back in for me when I was not at home? Can these entities move around with you?

I have been meaning to set up an account here, but I am a great procrastinator. Yesterday I was sitting in my recliner for a few minutes before going out. I had been ready to post everything after I set up an account, but I procrastinated for a couple of weeks, and then yesterday something new happened. I leave my Kindle Fire on the arm of my recliner. It was unplugged and to my left while I checked something out before leaving. I looked over and it turned on. Now, if there is no power plugged in, I must hold the power button to a 5 count before it turns on, so somebody was trying to be helpful, which it would have been if not for the fact I was going out.

I am of an age where quite a few people have Alzheimers and/or dementia, and I really would rather not join that group, so if someone with more knowledge than me would care to comment on the question of can spirits follow you around locally, I would be relieved if some do and that I am still sane.

A Shadow In The Forest,Japan,Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: A Shadow In The Forest

I have lived in Hokkaido for ten years. A few days before the event, I visited Nibutani, a village where the Ainu people preserve their culture and traditions. An elder told me about Ke-saru, a spirit said to live deep in the forest and watch those who enter.

He explained,""Ke-saru doesn't chase people, but it watches carefully. If someone is careless or disrespectful, it takes more than just fear.""

The name Ke-saru means""face peeler""in the Ainu language, referring to the spirit's dangerous nature toward those who show arrogance or disrespect in the forest.

Before I left, the elder taught me a prayer to say if I ever felt the spirit nearby,""Kamuy ceppesuy."" This means,""Spirit, please return to your home."" The Ainu believe that spirits called kamuy live in all parts of nature, animals, plants, rivers, and the wind.

While hiking alone in the Hidaka Mountains, the air suddenly became cold. All birds singing, wind rustling leaves stopped completely. Then, I saw a dark shape moving slowly between the trees. It was too large and moved too quietly to be a bear or any animal I know around.

At that moment, I felt a heavy pressure and had difficulty breathing. Remembering the elder's words, I whispered the prayer,""Kamuy ceppesuy.""

For several seconds, the Shadow stayed still before silently disappearing into the darkness.

When I returned to Nibutani and told the elder what happened, he said, ""It saw you. You are lucky it let you go.""

Since then, I have avoided walking alone in that part of the forest. The silence and shadows are not just empty, they feel like something is watching.

Did I encounter the Ke-saru or can anyone explain what happened?

Spirits From Ripley's,"Florida, United States",Ghost Tours & Haunted Hotels,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Ghost Tours & Haunted Hotels :: Spirits From Ripley's

R ipley's Believe It Or Not seems to have more than just artifacts from different locations around the world. Some seem to be there from the Paranormal Realm, which I had the opportunity to investigate and experience.

Just like at the Old Jail, you go through a little bit of an introduction, a run over of the gear that they have to let you use, then you are released to investigate the building. I was not expecting all the activity that we had the opportunity to witness, and it definitely itched the scratch of wanting to get some interactions to see if there was paranormal activity.

This location gave more EVP evidence than anything else. Which part of it was receiving the name Steve a few times. Then there was a time frame where it said ""switch"", which I was there with a friend, and asked if it wanted me to hand the spirit box to my friend, which we received the response ""yes"" and it then proceeded to whistle at him a few times.

At this location, we were not receiving very many spirit orbs, but was a lot more heavy on the Voice Phenomena when we were asking questions. Now the one time that I had some concern was mentioning that I was going to go downstairs, and got a very heavy, deep, angry sounding NO! Response through the spirit box, which, much to say, I did not go downstairs at that point.

Then towards the end of the investigation, we were standing in one of the exhibits and received the response ""Die"" or ""Will Die"" and at that point my buddy as well as myself were like, nope we are stepping out of this room and going elsewhere.

Either way, that was my first investigation before doing the Old Jail investigation and hope that you guys enjoyed reading this.

Ghosts Of The Old Jail,"Florida, United States",Ghost Tours & Haunted Hotels,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Ghost Tours & Haunted Hotels :: Ghosts Of The Old Jail

I figured I would share a story of one of the experiences that I have had in my life, that I feel like was the most interesting encounters that I have had to this day.

A friend and myself had gone to St. Augustine in Florida, and while there, noticed that the old jail had these paranormal investigations that you could pay to go on at night. Now to start it out, they didn't give too long in there. If I remember correctly you would be allowed to investigate on your own, but after receiving a short introduction and a quick run through of the equipment that they would let you use while there. All together I think we were allowed like 30-45 minutes for the investigation after all the intro and run through with the equipment was done.

But this was my second time doing an investigation, and the whole time they were doing the introductions outside, I could feel some eyes on me from inside the old jail. I remember it was the second floor off to the left side as you look at the Old Jail from outside. Then when we walked inside, we were able to get our hands on some equipment and investigate.

So we started out in the kitchen, and were not really receiving anything there, and proceeded to move over to the cells and see what was out there. Which we didn't really receive anything there, and proceeded to go to the Solitary Confinement Cells. That is where the real stuff kicked off. We didn't capture any EVP's but we did receive spirit orbs (which I had caught on camera) and there was a point when I captured the sounds of feet shuffling on camera.

Now with that, we kept getting spirit orbs every time when we would mention the sheriff, and then we went up to where the sheriff lived when he was over the prison, and caught more spirit orbs as well. When we were checking around in there, I had stepped to the side and received a tug on my shirt, which kind of startled me.

That was one of two investigations that was done in St. Augustine and will be writing the story of the other investigation that we had done, and would love to share that story with you guys as well. Also in regards to the story, if there is interest in seeing the video footage from the old jail, I have those uploaded on my YouTube channel, and can share that link with those that are interested in it.

"Visiting Shaft No. 4, An Old Coal Mine In Hokkaido",Japan,Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: Visiting Shaft No. 4, An Old Coal Mine In Hokkaido

I recently visited an old coal mine near Yubari called Shaft No. 4. It closed many years ago and is now abandoned.

The rusty gate at the entrance was cut open. I took a flashlight and walked inside. The air was cooler and damp, smelling like earth and rust. The tunnel walls were rough stone, and my flashlight only lit a small part ahead.

It was very quiet except for my footsteps. After a while, the air got colder. I could see my breath even though it wasn't cold outside. Then I heard some soft tapping sounds coming from deeper in the tunnel where I couldn't see.

The tapping didn't sound natural. It was like someone walking carefully. I stopped and listened, but the tapping stopped after a few seconds. It felt like something might have been there, just out of sight.

After that, I thought I heard faint whispers, but I couldn't make out any words. It was a quiet sound, and it felt like a warning to leave.

A sudden chill ran through me, and I felt uneasy. When I turned to head back, I saw a shadow move quickly along the wall. I shined my flashlight there, but there was nothing. The darkness seemed deeper than before.

Outside, the sun was setting, but the cold feeling and quietness stayed with me. The usual sounds felt far away.

Even now, I think about that visit. It feels like the miners who worked and died there left a presence behind, a quiet feeling in the cold tunnels.

Visiting abandoned mines can be dangerous. The tunnels may collapse, and the air might be poor. If you go, bring a friend, wear boots and a helmet, carry a flashlight with extra batteries, and tell someone where you're going. Be careful and respect the place and its history.

Yubari was once a busy coal mining town from the early 1900s to the 1960s. Mining was difficult work, and many miners lost their lives underground. When coal demand dropped, the mines closed, and towns like Yubari became empty.

Visiting Shaft No. 4 connects me to that history. It also reminds me that some memories don't fully go away even in dark tunnels.

Encounter Of A Spirit Of A Spider?,Japan,Pets / Animals,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Pets / Animals :: Encounter Of A Spirit Of A Spider?

I had a dream. In it, I was in my hobby room where I keep all my tarantulas. Everything looked exactly the same as in real life, the shelves, the lighting, the soft hum of the air, the subtle warmth. It felt ordinary. But the silence carried a strange weight.

That's when I saw my oldest tarantula. The one who had passed some time ago. She didn't move, but somehow, her thoughts reached into me.

And yet I knew exactly who she meant. The Singaporean Blue. A beautiful spider I had planned to ship out the next morning.

In the dream, I didn't question how I knew, it just made sense. Her message didn't need to be spoken aloud.

I wanted to respond, but I knew I couldn't. Even within the dream, I understood this was a one-way message. I was only meant to receive.

When I woke up, sunlight filled the room. My packaging table was ready, the materials laid out neatly. I was supposed to ship the Singaporean Blue that very day. But the dream lingered.

And there she was. Curled gently around an egg sac. Quietly guarding it, protecting it.

If I had shipped her that day, the eggs might've been lost. She might have been harmed. I cancelled the shipment immediately and called my friend to explain. Thankfully, he understood.

I'm not claiming it was a ghost or something supernatural. But the dream gave me something I had no way of knowing. It changed what I did.

So if something speaks to you in a dream, gives you a message you couldn't have known otherwise, and alters your path, doesn't that make it an encounter? I don't know for sure. But I'm grateful I listened.

Hug Goodbye,Australia,Family / Friends Visits,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Family / Friends Visits :: Hug Goodbye

Y esterday an old friend of the family passed away. V didn't want anyone visiting toward the end, only her immediate family. I wanted so badly to spend more time with her but I respected her wishes.

About a year ago I knew something was wrong with her; it was a gut feeling and nothing more. As the months went by I dreamt about her a lot. In most of these dreams I'm standing on the road outside her house. I know I can't get in and I don't try. They're sad dreams. In one dream I find a path beside one of the front gates. I enter through this path, it leads me to their house. But the house isn't there, it's like it was never built and I can't find my way out again. All dreams are in daylight.

I never asked V if she was okay or if she was ill. A part of me knew not to and another part of me didn't want to know. She's never been the best when it comes to doctors and conversations relating to medical topics always fall flat.

About ten years ago V had another medical scare but came out without a scratch. With little to no medical treatment. She really thought she'd live forever and so did everyone else if we're honest.

Last night I was at home tidying up. While I was dusting a desk I felt V suddenly behind me. It was such a strong feeling and I could see her in my mind stood behind me. I didn't turn around but I said her name and the feeling got stronger still. I could see clearly in my mind how she was standing, what she was wearing, how her hair was styled, everything. In my mind I could see her touching my shoulders in a half hug, way you do when you're comforting someone. When V touched my shoulders there was such an intense unmistakable feeling of her being right there. After a moment I shook the feeling off and walked away because I didn't want this to be what I believed it to be. Wish I hadn't done that.

Last night I kept dreaming of V. Just random stuff like sitting in their kitchen chatting, their dogs being rowdy. One dream was of one of her lampshades which she made for me when I was a wee lass. I have it sitting out ready for an old lamp that needs rewiring.

Today I got the call that she had passed away. I don't know what time it happened, only that it happened yesterday.

While I was on the phone the call kept going into static sounds. At one point the phone beeped a long kind of 'beep' sound. Never heard my phone make that noise. I was talking to my dad, who informed me. The paranormal is a no go topic for him so I didn't bring it up, not sure if he heard anything on his end.

I know it sounds cliché but V's always been an inspiration to me. In that she's always been unapologetically herself. Her passion for antique everything was completely unmatched and her home was the most haunted place I've ever known. I wrote about their ghosties years ago on here. The eccentric couple with the big ole posh place.

V was born into extreme wealth but was a hippy and artist at heart. Never worked a day in her life. Dedicated much of her time to helping others. She was so generous with people, often times to her own detriment. She would often have people in need live with her, usually recovering addicts. Which was often dangerous as V and her husband are big into recreational substances. It usually ended badly, very badly. V was beaten up a few times by some of the people she took in. Her heart was always in the right place but she could be very naive.

I don't think it's completely sunk in yet. I thought writing about last night would make me feel something but I'm kind of just numb.

On a slightly unrelated note about a year ago I was watching a horror on Netflix. In this movie someone holds a duck out from around a doorway or around a corner or something. It's a white duck and someone holds it out so it's like looking at you from the doorway. It's a silly quirky scene but it scared the bejesus out of me. For anyone who may remember, when I wrote about V's place years ago I wrote about a duck puppet that stuck its head around the doorway when we were kids. I thought V's daughter had done this and ran towards the puppet but nothing was there. So, did someone from Netflix read that or what?

The Haunting Of Willows Apartments,"Nebraska, United States",Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: The Haunting Of Willows Apartments

I 'm here to talk about my experiences as a kid in the Willows Apartments. I'm not sure why no one talks about them much, but that place is hell.

When I was just 9-10 years old, I had a very bad experience and very negative. My mom had stayed here when we moved in, I knew something was badly off. I started noticing it when mom would get angry more and easier. I knew being a single parent was bad enough and ever since I was a kid, I'm a magnet for spirits and demonic entities. It's terrifying when you're just a kid.

It started off when moms' emotions would increase, the smallest things could set her off. I could understand why maybe it was stress until... That quickly changed. Started to hear footsteps at night, knockings, slamming kitchen cabinets would wake me up. I thought it was mom, but I would get up and to find her always fast asleep.

One day a childhood friend of mine came to stay the night little did I know that was the last night we stayed there; we encountered evil. My friend and I were in the bedroom playing with toys, when all the sudden I saw a shadow dark run across the wall. I pointed at it and asking her did you see that she looked at me in fear like she saw the whole thing not just a shadow. I screamed for my mom, tears down my face, ""I saw it! I saw a shadow!""

My mom saw my fear and felt it. She contacted her close friend and we cleansed what we could of out apartment and never looked back.

Later that week mom found out that the buildings were built on very bad Indian burial ground, many deaths followed, and the apartments continue to haunt the living to this day.

Unexpected Messages From Loved Ones,"Georgia, United States",Photographs / Videos / EVP,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Photographs / Videos / EVP :: Unexpected Messages From Loved Ones

I t's been a longtime away from the site, just busy but I'm now officially an empty nester and had some extra time to catch up with you all here.

I wanted to document two recent instances of EVPs that just happened unexpectedly, plus something related to the empty nester thing.

First, I was videoing some birds gathering in a tree in my back yard in early spring. They were making a ton of noise eating on the berries and I thought to send the video to my husband at work so walked out to record them. On the way back inside, as it was cold, I yet again didn't tap the off button properly to turn off the video recording (I'm so bad with my phone) so ended up with footage of the birds and the ground as I was walking back inside. But upon playback, as I'm crossing the patio, one can hear a fairly obvious EVP of a voice saying, ""OOH RAH,"" which is what U.S. Marines say... All the dang time. My late husband Scott was a Marine (as is my current husband). If current husband had been in the house, I might conclude the voice was his, but this morning he was already AT WORK. I can't imagine any of my elderly neighbors hollering like a Marine, so I'm left thinking it was Scott, yet again finding a way to be heard on a random day. He died from brain cancer in 1993 at age 32.

Then, last week, went to visit family graves at the cemetery where my aunt was recently interred. Scott's plot is just across the small interior street from my mom's. You can stand at mom's grave and see his and vice versa. Anyway, I decided to record as I walked up, because last time I was there I got an EVP. This visit, a woman's voice on video says, ""It's a woman"" as I'm walking to the gravesite. I stand there a minute and look over to Scott's grave and pretty sure there was a tear falling as I walked back down a slight hill to my car. The same woman's voice says, ""It's ok"" on my video recording. Easily heard, much appreciated.

Finally, Mom had given me a silver bracelet at the time of her diagnoses with cancer in 2013. I'm not much for jewelry, but I wore this bracelet every day. Sometime at the beginning of the covid lockdown, I lost it. Obviously not going anywhere, but it just sort of disappeared and over the last four years I've looked everywhere and yes, it did cross my mind that it was significantly from my mom.

Well, I have four kids and the last of them graduated from high school this spring. I've been raising kids 36 years and am 64 now, so it's going to be great as these last two finish college and join their siblings in adulthood. We had a large graduation party and that day I went into the closet where Mom's china (she left me) is kept to get a platter. I had to move a silver gravy boat out of the way to get to it and guess what just happened to be in the gravy boat? Right -- Mom's silver bracelet! Found on the day of the last kid's graduation, an occasion I know Mom would've loved. There is NO reason for that bracelet to have been there these last four years! I can't help but think it was yet another message from Mom.

The Cry In The Tunnel,China,Ghost Tours & Haunted Hotels,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Ghost Tours & Haunted Hotels :: The Cry In The Tunnel

A few years ago, I visited Harbin during the coldest part of winter.

The city was covered in deep snow, and the air was sharp and dry.

Walking through the streets, everything felt quiet and still - a kind of stillness that comes with extreme cold.

I had come as a tourist, interested in both the city's architecture and its history.

One site in particular stood out on the map: the Unit 731 Museum.

Unit 731 was a former covert military facility operated by the Imperial Japanese Army during World War II.

It served as a research base for biological warfare. Inside, human experiments were conducted (studies on frostbite, intentional infection with disease, and live vivisections.)

Thousands of people, many of them civilians and prisoners of war, died as a result.

The lighting is dim, and many areas of the building have been left in their original condition.

The displays include photos, documents, and preserved medical tools.

At one point, a guide pointed to a stairway leading underground and said,

""That tunnel leads to the prisoner cells. You may go down alone if you'd like.""

The tunnel was narrow, the walls damp. The air was colder than above.

Water dripped steadily from the ceiling, and the passage echoed faintly with each step.

Continuing forward, I heard another sound... Faint, possibly a voice.

It resembled a quiet whisper, unclear""Ahma."" (probably mother in Chinese)

Then I heard what sounded like a slow exhale close to my ear.

Back in the main building, I told a staff about what I had experienced.

She said, ""Many people hear things in that tunnel. Some things stay, even when they're gone.""

Though I don't claim to understand what I heard or felt, the visit to Unit 731 left an impression, not through horror or theatrics, but through the weight of documented history and preserved space.

It is a reminder of what human beings are capable of and why some places should be preserved, not forgotten.

The 3 A.m. Sleep Paralysis And Vivid Dreams,India,Old Hags / Night Attacks / Sleep Paralysis,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Old Hags / Night Attacks / Sleep Paralysis :: The 3 A.m. Sleep Paralysis And Vivid Dreams

The story is of my best friend. Let's call him Kapil. I am an eye witness of this.

This all happened during the lockdown in 2021. Kapil, my best friend, had been telling me about these really vivid and scary dreams he was having, always between 2 and 3 AM. He also mentioned experiencing sleep paralysis.

One day, with our exams approaching, I went over to his place for a night study session. It got pretty late, and around 1 AM, we decided to call it a night and get some sleep. We were sleeping in the same room, but our beds were on opposite walls.

Around 3 AM, I was jolted awake by a faint rustling sound. I sat up in my bed, and when my eyes landed on Kapil, a chill shot down my spine. He was thrashing, desperately trying to move, but couldn't, and his eyes were wide open. I immediately knew it was sleep paralysis.

Without thinking, I grabbed my water bottle and sprinkled a few drops on his face. It worked! He snapped out of it. But just as he did, we both heard it - the distinct sound of a plate dropping in the kitchen.

We were both instantly terrified. Neither of us dared to go check it out. Then, to our horror, the same sound came again. We just stayed frozen in our beds, listening.

After a few tense moments, we both started to relax a bit. I asked Kapil what had happened to him. He whispered that a ""totally black shadow"" had come and sat on his chest. He said he tried desperately to scream or even move his hands, but he couldn't. It was a truly terrible night for us.

After that night, I never tried to sleep at his home again. Kapil later told me that he continued to experience such incidents. Now he's in the UK, so I don't talk to him as much about it, but that night is something I'll never forget.

A Bizarre Encounter At The Olde Angel Inn,Canada,Ghost Tours & Haunted Hotels,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Ghost Tours & Haunted Hotels :: A Bizarre Encounter At The Olde Angel Inn

A t the early morning hours of May 25th, 1813, American military forces had launched a third invasion attempt against Canada. After U.S. Naval vessels had arrived along the shores of the Niagara River, a relentless two-day assault commenced against the British defense stronghold of Fort George. Despite valiant efforts to defend the fort, the Redcoat defenders were soon overwhelmed by the invading forces and had no other option than to abandon the fort. The Americans soon stormed into the adjacent town of Newark (modern day Niagara on the Lake) with the intentions of burning it to the ground. The siege ultimately led to a local tavern known as the Harmonious Coach House, where a British officer named Captain Colin Swayze would meet his tragic demise.

In order to flush out any enemy troops hiding within the tavern's basement, American soldiers took their bayonets and began systematically impaling the wooden wine barrels as well as any other objects capable of concealing any potential hiders. After being spotted within the confines of an empty barrel, Captain Colin Swayze was promptly stabbed and succumbed to his injuries almost immediately. (Mysteries of Canada, 2024)

Eventually, the Harmonious Coach House was renamed the Olde Angel Inn. Due to the utter brutality of Captain Swayze's death, it comes as no surprise that his restless spirit continues to linger aimlessly throughout the inn. Nestled within the heart of Niagara on the Lake, the Olde Angel Inn remains a popular destination for those intrigued by the many alleged hauntings reported over the span of several years. Being highly publicized in multiple paranormal reality shows, it becomes rather easy to understand why the inn receives such high amounts of revenue in tourism on an annual basis.

My first and only trip to the Olde Angel Inn happened back in August of 2006. I was accompanied by my mother, as well as my sister and brother. We had been informed of an apparent incident that occurred at the inn years prior to our arrival, which fueled our interests to visit. It was said that the incident involved a young American woman visiting the town with a group of her friends and decided to spend the night at the renowned hotel. She apparently wore a T-shirt depicting the image of a waving American flag. After exiting her room and nonchalantly traversing the hall, she abruptly stopped in her tracks, as she claimed to have felt the intense sensation of being slapped across the face. Though there was no definite proof to explain the encounter, it could be surmised that the vindictive Captain Swayze still continues to express his distain for those who happen to share the same nationality as the lone individual responsible for his departure.

We had finally arrived at the inn in the late afternoon. Though we were all mildly nervous, we were still highly excited and decided to help ease the tension by making jokes about the encounters reported by former guests. After an evening of bike riding, followed by an extended tour of Fort George, we decided to head back to the inn and go to sleep. For the first couple of hours, I struggled to fall asleep. Once I had begun to gradually calm myself down, I began to drift off and abruptly awoke, feeling as if someone had forcibly grabbed my shoulders. I was perfectly aware that I was the only one fully awake, as the others were peacefully sleeping in the adjacent bedroom. Despite the bewildering experience, I soon managed to fall asleep and woke up the following morning feeling well rested. The hotel had even given us a certificate to confirm our stay at the inn. As a humorous gesture, my mother decided to hang the certificate on our refrigerator. In spite of the strange experience, I still hope to one day return to the Olde Angel Inn and perhaps share even more personal stories.

My Dog Reacting to the Ghost Hunters Show,"Ohio, United States",Misc,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Misc :: My Dog Reacting to the Ghost Hunters Show

H ello again! Boy, it's been awhile since I last entered a story. Well, you remember my last story The Cat Coming to Visit ? Yeah, well, I just remembered something. I had told about the haunted slave-house that the cat story had happened a year after that incident. Well, I'd forgotten about my dog and Ghost Hunters (TAPS) experience.

My dog is a Brittany Spaniel. Real sweet dog. She is usually hyper around family and friends, but shy around strangers. And, she almost never barks. Unless it's at the neighbor's dog. This proved to be important.

I was around, ummm... 12, I think. I'd been thinking a lot on ghosts (it was october) and, even though my mother had forbidden me to watch ghost shows, I had gone into the living room to watch Ghost Hunters (TAPS). I'd never seen it before, and I was already nervous about my mom finding out. But, after a few minutes I relaxed and settled into the show.

Okay, this is how we were arranged: I was sitting on the couch, facing the T.V. My dog was laying diagonally facing the T.V on my left, while my cat was curled up near my feet on my right.

I do believe the episode I was watching was called Shadow People . The guys were talking to the family about the spirits of children living in their children's room. Now, they were showing the family a clip of audio they had heard. It was Jason talking, then a little girl's voice saying ""Who's Jason?""

Well, right after that played, my dog leapt up from her spot and started barking at the T.V. After about a minute, she settled down to just woofing, looking from me to the T.V as they replayed the ""Who's Jason?"" over and over. I turned off the T.V and she settled back down.

My cat, interestingly enough, hadn't reacted at all. So, I went scoping through the house to see if it was something else that had startled my dog. There wasn't anything. Both the neighbors on either side said their dogs had been asleep.

And yet, about a month ago, when I had my friend over and was showing it to her, my dog didn't react. I wonder if it was just a one-time thing? I wanted to get in contact with Ghost Hunters (TAPS) and ask them about it, but I just figured it was too stupid to bother with.

If you guys have ever had that happen to you, please let me know!

Pushed by a Black Figure,"New York, United States",Apparitions / Voices / Touches,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Apparitions / Voices / Touches :: Pushed by a Black Figure

S ome of you may have read my other story, The Old Man and the Young Boy , well, this happened a while before. I was laying down, sleeping in my bed, and then out of no where, I feel a hard push. I turned and I looked and I see a very, very dark color by (I don't know whether it was a black aura or he was really dark skinned) my bed. I just looked at him for a while, and he just slowly dissipated. I have no idea what it meant, but it freaked me out. I did not tell my parents about what happened, because I knew they would not believe me, or would think I was dreaming. This boy looked nothing like the boy haunting me now, but I don't know. I have heard many people say blue is good, black is bad, but I don't know. It's all really confusing, and I can't help feeling that he (or she, I couldn't tell) was trying to tell me something, or that he was trying to hurt me. About 5 years later, the other incident happened, and I would really appreciate help

Running Over an Apparition,"California, United States",Apparitions / Voices / Touches,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Apparitions / Voices / Touches :: Running Over an Apparition

T his is another incident that happen to me when I was 5 years of age. Actually since I was growing up I saw and heard stuff all the time. Yet in this event I wasn't the only one that experienced something weird. My parents planned a camping trip for the whole family. The place was Yosemite national park in California. It took us a while getting there but it was all worthwhile. Yet on our way back home, something strange happened, not only to me, but also to my mother.

We headed back home and it was dark. I don't know if many people have been to Yosemite park before, but there is lots of turns and the roads are pretty dark in the night. It's very dangerous if your not a safe driver. As we left, the night was barely setting, my father was driving very carefully and was going in a very slow speed. He didn't want anything happening to us while on the road. I remember that it was already dark and my father was driving and having a conversation with my mother. My big brother and sister were in the back of the van sleeping and as I usually get car sick, I was sitting on the side window smelling air so I wouldn't vomit. All of a sudden, I looked ahead and saw a man wearing a blue jogging pants and sweater, he was just in front of our car walking while we were on the move. We just ran over him. At that same moment I was confused to see that my father did nothing to stop.

Well, as I was recovering from what I saw, I later heard my mother screaming at my father saying ""oh my got you ran over him ... You ran over him"" My father, confused, asking my mother ""ran over who? What are you talking about?"" At this time he had pulled over and was very confused to have heard my mother scream and saying he had ran over a man. My sister and brother woke up at the noise and was asking what was going on.

My father managed to calm my mother down. He managed to assure her that he didn't run over anyone. He got out of the van, looked in front of the hood with her. No dents were present, no blood was around, no one else saw anything. At least that's what they assumed. My father told her that it was all in her imagination, that she was tired and just imagined it. Yet as she described the same man, I was even more confused. Why did I saw the same thing as my mother and we were the only ones?

I just let it go and kept my mouth shut. I felt bad in one point because my mom knew she wasn't seen things, yet how could she prove it if no one else saw? As my father got back in the van and started it up, I was debating on I should say something or not. We were driving off and out of the blues I felt an urge to turn back and see through the window. I looked, there he was, in the middle of the road looking straight at me and as we were leaving, he started to jog again and disappeared into the darkness.

We arrived home and no one ever talked about it again and since then, we haven't been camping.

The Haunted Apartment,"Massachusetts, United States",Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: The Haunted Apartment

M e and my husband at the time and my two sons were renting this apartment, and it needed a lot of work when we moved in, but that's what he did for a living, remodeling apartments. We had no problem in the beginning, until we were almost done remodeling, then it all started. The front door gave us such a hard time trying to open it, he and I literally slammed our bodies into the door together, while turning the knob, finally, after a while it opened. So, we decided to use the back door, even though the front would've been more convenient.

One day, all four of us were sitting in the living room, near that door, locked it opened by itself. Then around 8-9/PM my husband ran to the laundry mat, while I stayed with the kids, who were 2 and 7 years old. I stayed home painting. I heard that door-knob jiggle, I almost ran to it to let him in (but if it was him, he would open it). I heard a woman voice, as if she were talking to a little girl say, ""Hello"" I ran in the kids room and slammed the door behind me, grabbing a baseball bat. My eldest son said, ""Alright mom"" but I was scared. I could hear (in my mind), outside that bedroom door that I ran into, men's big, black shoes, pacing back and forth outside the bedroom door, it was picking up the nails that my husband threw into an old roller tray for painting. Nails being picked up and dropped, over and over. I ran out into the hallway (the one we could use) with the kids until he came home. I heard a lady say ""Hi"" in my ear while walking across my kitchen.

Another day, I flew into the other room where my husband and kids were. The people downstairs kept coming up all the time, saying ""They couldn't stand the noise anymore, of bodies being thrown to the floor, and banging coming from our apartment..."" And we weren't even making any noises. The toilet and kitchen sink filled up with black water, over flowing also in that apartment. A bathroom light turned on after I just shut it off, I walked a couple of feet away, turned my head, it was back on. As I was walking by the kitchen cabinets, they clicked open with every step, one per step. Bugs started coming in the house, rats, and slugs all over the steps, when we'd come home. A bat was in the house, so I turned and ran from this bat, I struck my husband, took him down, he was holding his face in a fetal position, face down on the floor not moving. I accidentally took him off his feet, while running. I didn't see him, he hit his ribs on the edge of a thick wooden end-table, cracking his ribs. Because the bat was flying right into my face, I ran, slamming a door behind me.

We had to go to a hotel because we couldn't get the bat out that night! We moved in with a friend, just to get out of there, because we couldn't find an apartment. In time.

Black Silhouette 2,United Kingdom,Misc,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Misc :: Black Silhouette 2

I have written another story entitled black silhouette . I was staying at the same friend's house because his mum had gone to his aunt's party and he didn't want to be on his own. So I was making us some burgers in the oven when I heard my name being called out ""haaarrryyyy!"" then, in a really angry voice, something said ""I'm back!""

I ran into the front room where my friend was and I told him what I'd heard and he had gone blue in the face. ""Get off him""! I screamed and he went back to normal and was panting for air. ""Thank you"" he croaked. I went and turned the oven off and felt a sharp pain in my spine. One of his dogs ran over and started crying. I stroked it and it licked my hand (as usual).

When his mum came home, we told her what had happened and she said that she had been hearing her name being called out but experienced none of the attacks.

During the night whilst I was sleeping, I had a dream that my friend was being attacked. I woke up to see the black figure choking him again ""why are you doing this..."" I asked it, in a calm voice, it turned its head towards me and disappeared.

Y ou have to understand a few things to understand this story. I'm a child of five, the middle. At the time of living in this house, I was 9 and 10 years old. And my parents aren't married. My dad had to get out of my mother's house fast.  One of my sister's friends from dance were moving and their current home was right where my dad wanted to move to. So they invited us over to check it out and my dad bought it right away. The house wasn't big enough to hold 5 kids, 1 adult, and 2 dogs. But my dad was just going to look over the blue prints of the house to see if he could build onto the 2 lofts, one in my dad's room, and another one upstairs from the living room.

The first day in the house, we all slept on mattress because our beds weren't in yet. For some reason, I wouldn't sleep in my room, I wanted to, but wouldn't let myself. So I just crashed with my sister and one dog at the time. Our miniature dauchsund lola. We had never really heard her bark that much. But she would not stop barking! She would just like bark at the door even though my dad was out getting food for the morning and my brother was at hockey practice. It was only my little brother, daniel, me (elena), elizabeth, lauren , and lola! Then out of no where, lola starts whining! Then, the room turned ice cold, in the middle of spring, IN ARIZONA! Lola started jumping from mattress to mattress over and over again. Once my dad got home, I settled in his office.

We had very little furniture at the time, his office was the only room finished. So while he was on the computer, I crashed on a chair I had broken my foot on (I've broken my foot several times, but I broke mine 3 times in that house. I'll get to that later). I only had a blanket, no pillow. I started to feel a tickling sensation in my foot, I giggled, then I felt a sharp pain. I screamed at my dad to stop but he was on his computer. This happened several times in that chair.

About a month later, it was fathers day. We were all in my dad's room unwrapping gifts, having fun. Only my older brother, michael wasn't there. Soon though, he came charging in. Screaming at my dad. ""This house is haunted! Mrs. (name will not be told) knew! You never told us? How come I have never experienced anything?"" My dad started talking about what mrs.------ had told him. That she was one day folding laundry and she turned around. There she was, smiling like a haunted smile. She started screaming and throwing clothes at her. She also mentioned her cleaning ladies quit, running about of the house screaming. I decided to go to my room to get changed. I wasn't a believer in ghosts. As I was walking down the hall, I saw a dark figure in the front door. I screamed and my father came running in. ""She's here! I saw her! I swear"". My dad thought it was kind of odd. No one else had seen her. Only orbs out of the corner of their eyes. Everyone just went into the kitchen to make breakfast. I followed. In shock.

School restarted about 2 months later. I was standing in front of the mirror in the door way, around where I had last seen her. I was making sure my hair was ok. I looked deep into the mirror, and she was there! But this time I saw a full human! Standing there slightly glowing. She had hair about shoulder length, she had a white shirt on with a half top that tied in the middle over it, she had a knee length skirts on and she had her hand on my shoulder. She was young and beautiful. When I turned around, I saw a black shadow, I turned back to the mirror, and the shadow was there. But it didn't fade away, it just popped out of sight. I screeched, ran into the loft office to get my dad. ""She's, she's, she's hand on shoulder, black, thingy, shadow"", was all I could get out.

One night I was sleeping in my room, the room the little ghost girl with the same name as me who wouldn't let me in. I felt a quick whoosh of wind, the fan knocked over (I had a bunk bed so my fan was all the way by my closet). I woke up, like I had been lifted up and then thrown down, I tried to get up to fix my fan and close my ALREADY CLOSED window. But I couldn't! Something or someone was holding my down. What ever it was finally let me go. I investigated, my fan was back in place and my window was closed and locked. I went back to sleep, back then I heard a woman's voice singing me a lullaby. I simply covered my ears and said ""go away! My mother doesn't live here!"".

About a another month later, my dad got me a small pet mouse. She had a metal wheel in her cage of which she loved. But she was not your normal rodent, she was awake during the day, and asleep at night. I noticed that her wheel was always spinning at night. So one night I decided to investigate. There she was, in her little house. Asleep. I was watching in horror as the wheel turned itself.

We lived in the house for a year and half. That half we tried to sell the house. People would walk into the house happy, loving it, then walk out almost depressed. Of course, I was the only one that noticed. As strange as it sounds, we had 3 mice. One for all of my sisters and me. For some reason, mine, roxxi, killed my little sister lauren's mouse moooo. We thought it was strange. That only happens when there is a male mouse usually. But we only had female. We were at my mom's house for 2 days, we left and we only had 2 mice left, roxxi and cookie. When we came home, cookie was dead! My older sister was crushed, it appeared she had died of starvation, but my dad had just fed her the other day. And she had 5 bowls of food! Everyone one was empty! It was impossible. My dad looked in her mouth to see if she had choked. All clear. Then I walked into my room and screamed as loud as could, ""roxxi! Dad! Dad! Roxxi!"" He came running into my room to see what was wrong, she had a HUGE cut on her rib area. We rushed her to the vet and couldn't find any way that could of happened. I ran into my room putting roxxi down on my desk! ""You did it!"" Is all I screamed. We moved three months later.

Me and my dad decided to investigate the home's history, it turned out every owner had some sort of relationship with the last owner. My dad hired a psychic and she said the chair I had slept in was where see the mom ghost, my room was where her daughters room was and where she died. She was a Mormon and hated rodents. I have many other experiences but there too many to fit on one story.

I was the only one who experienced so much. My dad was the only one who had small things happen. The crazy thing is I think she is following me. I was told that she thinks I'm her daughter and that she want some to stay. A few times, I have felt like I have been watched. And we moved into a home that was just built. We were the first occupants. But I woke up one night to get a glass of water and saw her! I started thinking about her astral projecting from the old house. My dad believes I can see the dead.

Finally, a story with my mom. My mom had a deacon from the local church come to bless her house. At the time, she wasn't religious at all. After the blessing I ran into my room crying (I was about 5 or 6), ""I don't want bear to leave!"" (bear was our old dog).

A Girl's Voice in the Speakers,"North Carolina, United States",Apparitions / Voices / Touches,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Apparitions / Voices / Touches :: A Girl's Voice in the Speakers

I t all started when I was home alone just singing along to one of my favorite Avril Lavigne songs. I had the music turned up fairly loud, and I was having fun. Then, I heard this really weird noise coming from inside the speaker that sounded sort of like a girl talking, but I thought it was just my imagination. I kept listening to the music, and I heard a girl talking in the background. I got a bit spooked, and I turned the music off. Then, I tried to convince myself that I was imagining it, so I turned on just the speaker for clarification. It was quiet at first, but then I heard the girl's voice again. I got really, really freaked out, and I turned it off. After a few minutes, I turned it on again and asked her not to hurt me, and I asked her what she was. I heard a noise like a girl trying to say something clearly, but I by then I was scared out of my mind. I told her that I was getting really freaked out, and that I had to go. I turned the speaker off again, and I realized that I was shaking. Until then, I had never really believed in ghosts, but now I'm convinced that there is something else out there. I just don't know what to do.

I need answers, and I don't know what to do. I doubt my parents will believe me, and I really want to know what she wants, but I'm hesitant to ever turn on the speaker again. Please help me.

Apparitions Aren't Always Transparent,"Virginia, United States",Apparitions / Voices / Touches,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Apparitions / Voices / Touches :: Apparitions Aren't Always Transparent

M y name is Brittany and I'm telling you about a ghost encounter I had when I was only 11. It was a Friday night and the next morning I was going to camp with my church class.  The camp trip was a week long, so I wouldn't be seeing my parents for a week. I was sleeping in our guest bedroom when I heard my step dad (Jerry) call me in to their room to come sleep with my mom and him because they would miss me (because I wouldn't see them for a week). So I went in to their room and fell asleep (boy was I comfortable).

At around 5:30am, my mom woke me up and said Jerry's alarm would be going off in about an half-hour. So I went and laid on our couch and I looked up because I didn't feel right and I saw this lady standing in the arch way between our dining room and living room.

I'll never forget what the woman looked like: she had black, straight, shoulder-length hair, she was wearing a purple shirt (with different flowers in 3 boxes), black jeans on, and white tennishoes. Everybody says when they see a ghost they can see through them, but this lady or thing was NOT transparent. She looked like a real person that was alive, she even had color in her skin. She didn't make any noise, she just looked at me with her arms crossed. And another thing that was a little confusing was ghost usually come when it is really dark, well we had our oven light on and that lit up the whole house.

After I saw her I ran into my mom's room and tried to go to sleep. My mom said it was just my imagination but I know what I saw and there was nothing imaginary about it!

I have been asking the previous owners of our house (who happen to be family friends) if anyone died in the house that looked like her and they are still saying no. Well, that house has previously burnt down but we are still building a new house on the same lot but I hope the lady is gone.

The Old Bar,"Indiana, United States",Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: The Old Bar

W hen I was eight years old, my family bought this old bar. The man we bought it from sold it for about half the price it was worth. My family didn't care though so we bought the place. We unpacked our stuff and started to make the place a little more like home. On the main floor was where the bar was held and on the 2nd floor was where we lived.

Every thing was fine until one day, when me and my younger brother were upstairs playing in our room when the room become a chilly cold. We noticed it right away and told our mom. She checked the heating and it was working. Later on, me and my brother kept seeing this old man sitting on the window panel smoking a cigar.

Other happenings also happened. When you went into the bar area late at night, you will see young girl walking around whispering to herself. After a few more years we moved out of that house and never mentioned it again. I am 13 now and did a little researched on that bar. It was built in 1902 and the old man and his daughter lived there after his wife died. They lived there for years until he murdered his daughter for frolicking with a local man and then shot himself in his room (me and my brothers room)!

A Strange Haunting in Folsom,"California, United States",Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: A Strange Haunting in Folsom

I have always been a curious creature. I joined the Ordo Rosae Crucis (AMORC) aka the Rosicrucians to better understand secret societies. When I was going to college, I did a book report on cults like the Hare Krishna, Peoples' Temple, Church of Scientology and even the Church of Satan, by actually visiting these cults and talking with the members of these cults. Of course, I got an A in Sociology for actually doing my own personal investigations of these cults. The funny thing is that the Church of Scientology and the Church of Satan actually asked me to leave, because I was counteracting everything they were saying and it angered them. As a ghost writer and paranormal investigator for H.P.I. (Haunted and Paranormal Investigations) of Northern California. I want to better understand ghosts, spirits, poltergeist activity, demons, residual hauntings. How can I do this? Easy, by learning firsthand though a professional outfit like HPI.

I also sit and wonder on the existence of ghosts. Do they have jobs like living people? Do they know of the existence of God? I came up with my own theories on life after death. Here's my theory. When a person dies, they are confronted by the light. They are beckoned by deceased family and friends who try to entice them to go into the light. When they refuse, they remain on Earth. It appears that most ghosts are confined to a home, to a place that they are familiar with or even to a graveyard. Why? Perhaps in the afterlife, they have 'ghost police'. A governing force of spirits that keep them entrapped in one area, until they are ready to go into the light and reach a energy plane with other spirits. An energy plane that may be known as heaven or even hell. Perhaps some spirits or ghosts don't want to enter the light, because they are afraid that they may go into a place of damnation. A place that we learned from the preachers of our churches that talk of fire and brimstone and a lake of fire. Let's talk about demons for a minute. Now demons are completely different from ghosts. Demons that were formerly angels, have more powers than your average day ghost and can manifest any part of the world in a blink of an eye. No one seems capable of controlling demons, unless an exorcism takes place and perhaps then angels will keep the demon at bay and chase the demon away. Residual Hauntings? With residual hauntings, an intense event took place. Perhaps a murder, perhaps a rape, perhaps even a very important speech that was given to some very important people. Because of these events, a lot of untapped energy was released from the people that participated in this event. So much energy, that it left an imprint in the atmosphere and like a recorder, it plays back the event over and over again. We at times can see these events take place in a ghostly realm, but we are unable to communicate with the ghosts of this event, because they are unaware of their surroundings, they are mere holographic images in the fabric of space and time, repeating an event over and over again. How about reincarnation? Is the person with the past life memories really that person of the past? I doubt it, but perhaps they are very much in tune with the energy of a deceased person and are able to see the life of that deceased person and even contain their memories. Causing the person who thinks they were reincarnated to think that they were once that person. A reincarnated person is actually a person that is very sensitive in picking up the memories of a deceased person and living with those past memories. What is the poltergeist phenomenon? When a child, usually a young girl is going through puberty, her body is changing inside and she is able to release energy that is so intense, that it can cause knocking or rapping sounds, cabinets to pop open, glasses to fall and break. All of us have a lot of energy within our bodies and sometimes that energy can be so powerful, it can cause disturbances in a home. Remember... We can move mountains with our mind, if we knew how to utilize our full mind power, we only utilize a small portion of our minds. Walter B. Gibson, the author of the 30s / 40s pulp hero The Shadow thought of his creation so much that the guests of his home would actually see The Shadow lurking around his house! Now that was a powerful mind!

On this Friday night, May 4, 2007, I joined fellow H.P.I. (Haunted and Paranormal Investigations) of Northern California paranormal investigator Cherie Vincent. We went to St. John Baptist Church Cemetery in Folsom, California. Cherie amazingly picks up many EVPs from this cemetery. Using a video camera, we picked up some dancing orbs over graves. At one time I asked to have my ponytail pulled. That didn't happen, but I did feel a light brushing across my leg, this occurred about 4 times. Cherie felt a slight tugging on her hair. The EVPs that we picked up were the following:

Cherie tells me in a whisper, when we were about to leave the cemetery: Let's go. EVP male voice: I can read your mind.

I have been to this cemetery with Cherie before during the day and we had more EVPs during the day, than we did at night. In fact during the day, when I asked to be touched, I felt a burning sensation on my leg, that bled, then bruised. The bruise looked later like a thumb print. Before we left, Cherie thought she heard someone call her name and asked if it was me that called her name. I told her 'no', I was on the other side of the cemetery when she heard her name called.

During stakeouts for ghosts, things can get extremely boring, so I bring along some good reading material and share it with the other ghost hunters. My favorite books for ghost hunt stakeouts are: After Dark - A Collection of Horror by horror novelist Jeani Rector, her website is: www.afterdarknovel.com. The Key of it All - An Encyclopedic Guide to the Sacred Languages & Magickal Systems of the World - Book Two: The Western Mysteries and of course the very first book... Book One: The Eastern Mysteries by David Allen Hulse. His website is: http://www.geocities.com/d_a_hulse/ David was the influence to Sandman comic book creator Neil Gaiman and Carlos Santana has been known to read his books! Other books that I find fascinating for ghost hunts are: Arnis Self-Defense - Stick, Blade, and Empty-Hand Combat - Techniques of the Philippines and Comprehensive Self-Defense by Jose G. Paman. It's important to have some good reading material when you go on ghost hunts, because the stakeouts can be long, tedious and boring, but the final results can be very exciting! Happy ghost hunting to everyone with a strong interest into the unknown! Learn more about H.P.I. At: www.HPIparanormal.net

Shadows Moving,Canada,Misc,"I t was a normal saturday, except for the fact that everyone in the house had gone out (there are 9 people that live in the house, brothers, sisters, parents) so everyone being out at the same time is very rare. I was watching some tv in the family room and out of the corner of my eye I thought I saw a shadow come through the door, so I turned around, and sure enough there was no one there. The next day I stayed home from church because I wasn't feeling well, this time I was in the living room laying on the couch reading, when I looked up and saw something short (about 2 feet tall) run across the kitchen, I just assumed the cold medicine was making me wonky and that it must have been my white shepard, so I got up and walked around the house, calling her name, only to hear her bark back her greeting from the back yard, and no, we don't have a doggy door.

This happened a few years back, since then, we have moved but these things seemed to have followed us, because everyone in my family has seen either one or the other.

The Empty Room,Canada,Misc,"O ne nice day in the summer of 2005, Desiree Rampling and her friend Skye were looking for Skye's brother Coltyn and her friend Dylan, when all of a sudden they had an urge to look in Skye's parents room. When Skye and Desiree opened the door, it shut on them. The girls were really creeped out and finally opened the door to realize the room was empty. They searched everywhere but it was empty and the window was locked so it was impossible for the guys to get out. The girls were really freaked out so they ran downstairs and finally found the guys and asked how the boys could get into the room and disappeared when the girls got into the room, but the guys said they didn't know what they were talking about. The girls explained the whole thing to the guys and the boys said they would check it out. They finally got to the room, there was no one there, so the boys were making fun of them until the parents got home. Desperately, Skye and Desi tried to convince them to look in the room but they disagreed until the girls convinced them. The adults checked in the room but no one (or thing) was in there and the girls never knew what happened that warm day in 2005.

A Visit from Uncle Gary,"Tennessee, United States",Family / Friends Visits,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Family / Friends Visits :: A Visit from Uncle Gary

W hen I was seven, my father's older brother, Gary, came to live with us after he got divorced. He was planning to stay with us a while, so my parents began fixing up a bedroom in our unfinished basement. The first night he was there, he was going to sleep with my 3 year old brother, as he had a full sized bed in his room. My little brother couldn't stand for someone to sleep with him, so he would have none of it, and that evening threw such a fuss that Gary ended up sleeping the remainder of his stay on the sofa bed in the living room.

Not even a couple of months after moving in, Gary died of a massive heart attack in his sleep, at the age of 34, while on a business trip in another state. The entire time he lived with us, my mother had a reoccurring dream that my father had died. In her dream she could clearly see my father in the casket and my uncle and his ex-wife standing in front of it. My mom had not seen my aunt in a while, and in the dream she had long hair, whereas last she'd seen her her hair was short.

At the funeral, my mom realized what she had been dreaming. My uncle had been dead a while before he was found, and was swollen. He looked more like my heavy set father in the casket. And there was my dad and Gary's ex-wife, who now had long hair, standing in front of the casket.

After the funeral my parents came to pick up me, my brother and sister, as we didn't go. When we got home the entire house smelled of carnations for several hours. About the time the smell went away we were all getting ready for bed.

My brother had been in bed not even half an hour when he started angrily yelling. We all went running to his room. He looked at my mother and said ""Get Gary out of my bed!"". He was sitting up, pointing next to him, adamant that Gary was indeed there and she needed to make him get out. My mother tried to convince my brother that Gary wasn't there, but he was starting to convince her that he was. He said ""Yes he is, and I want him out of my bed now!"". This went on for a couple of minutes. Then my brother laid back down, satisfied Gary was no longer there.

A few days after this incident my mom was riding to work with the next door neighbor, telling the story. As she told the story she started to smell carnations. The neighbor said she smelled it too, and that the smell was strong.

My mother told me about her dreams when I was about 9, and also told me some other strange things she had noticed before he died. I was pretty freaked the night my bother threw a tantrum, demanding we make my just buried uncle get out of his bed. My brother doesn't remember it, but the rest of the family will never forget.

6 Years Old Girl from the 1920s,"Minnesota, United States",Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: 6 Years Old Girl from the 1920s

M y sister recently stayed in our home, and said she was awoken from an afternoon nap by a little girl who was approximately 6-7 years old, wearing clothing that looked like it came from the 1920s-1930s. The girl asked her very clearly: ""Have you seen my mama?"" My sister replied ""No"" and then the girl promptly disappeared. This is far from the first such occurrence for my sister, who has been visited by numerous spirits in the past (including our great grandfather shortly after his funeral). However, she said it was unsettling because it was a child. She also said that she encountered spirits on the third floor of our home as well... Which I thought was very interesting because of two other occurrences:

1. My youngest daughter (15 months) becomes incredibly scared when I bring her with me up to the third floor to get things from a bedroom (practically climbing over my shoulder to get away from the room).

2. My working on the second floor, and clearly hearing footsteps and a ""rolling"" sound on the ceiling above me... Even though I had removed all the floor boards in that section of the attic level two years earlier.

I've also seen what I thought is another preschool daughter of mine walking in the hallways of the second floor in the evening on 3-4 occasions. The experience was so real/vivid that I called out my daughter's name and went to get her and take her back to bed... Only to not see her in the room I thought she walked into and then subsequently finding her sound-asleep in her room (on the other side of the house).

I have not yet been able to locate information on any young girls who might have died during the home's 95 year history. However, I would like to get to the bottom of this. Thanks for letting me share one of many stories and experiences I have had since my childhood.

Frank and the Handkerchief,"Minnesota, United States",Apparitions / Voices / Touches,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Apparitions / Voices / Touches :: Frank and the Handkerchief

M y wife and I always used to joke about ""Frank"", the mischievous ghost in our former 1940s home. We would frequently feel as though we were being watched when we were alone in the home, although one particular experience still makes the hair on my arms stand up several years later. I was on our second floor one evening, carrying a load of laundry from our basement up to our bedroom closet. When I entered the closet and turned on the overhead light, I saw what appeared to me as a black silk handkerchief... Hovering in the middle of the closet in front of me. Whatever it was hovered there for approximately 1-2 seconds, then dropped ""through"" the carpeted floor. To this day, I would SWEAR that the object was a tangible, three-dimensional object! I don't remember it casting any type of shadow, but it had a ""shiny"" surface that I could not see through, and was approximate 6-8 inches tall and 3-4 inches wide. The legend of ""Frank"" grew as a result, though that scared me... And is something I am hoping not to encounter again in the future.

Strange Silhouette in the Kitchen,"Pennsylvania, United States",Apparitions / Voices / Touches,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Apparitions / Voices / Touches :: Strange Silhouette in the Kitchen

T his actually happened yesterday morning. I was up bright and early yesterday morning (5:45am to be exact) so I could get a head start on spreading mulch in our gardens. I had to go in the garage to get a pair of gloves lying on top of a box that was resting on the top of a railing leading to stairs. Now the door to the garage leads right into the kitchen, and there's a window in that door, so you can get a pretty good view inside from where I was standing. I just happened to look at the window and saw what looked like a silhouette just standing there, doing absolutely nothing -just standing there, the front facing the front of the door. I wasn't exactly scared at first, but after looking at it for some time, it began to freak me out a little. I went back outside to keep working, but I came back later that day and saw it again! I shut my eyes and opened them again. The figure was standing exactly the same spot it was standing earlier, just like before, not doing anything -just standing there, looking towards the window. I got pretty scared that time. I'm not exactly sure what happened, just saying what I saw.

Something There,United Kingdom,Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: Something There

M y Auntie has this big old house in Cheshire that she lives in with my 15 years old cousin. This is what happened over the years: I loved to go and sleep over there. But something about that house was not right. It was just the feel of it when you are alone. I used to sleep over there when I was about 9, I used to get up in the middle of the night to go to the toilet. There used to always be a strange atmosphere, like I was being watched by someone. I knew that there was something in that house, particularly around the loft star-way and in the loft's hidden small room and the sitting room that is now not much used.

Several years on and my Aunties friend and her daughter were living with her and my cousin for a while. My Auntie asked me to take a cup down for her, and I did. I was nearly at the bottom of the stairs, and I just happened to look out into the darkness in front of me. The only light was coming from the Television and it was very dim because my Auntie's friend was watching a program there. I looked up into the darkness of the kitchen, and I saw in front of me a horrible gnarled hand. There was something just darn-right evil about it. As soon I saw it, I immediately looked away and rushed to the living room where my auntie's friend was. I was in shock, she comforted me and had to walk me up the stairs because I refused to go out there alone. She believed me because she too believed in the beyond.

This might have to do with my Auntie using a Ouija Board some years ago with her friends. I only heard this from my cousin, she said that when my Auntie (my cousin's mother) asked if there was anyone there, the cup (I think she made her own Ouija Board) violently flew of the table and smashed into pieces . When my Auntie first moved into the house, my cousin was in London at the time so she was alone for a few weeks. I don't know what exactly happened but she claimed that she heard someone walk up the stairs. A few days after that, she had the house exorcised and blessed.

There was a spirit there but I know that it has not gone, even now. I went up there again about 3 or 4 weeks ago. This time, I had several weird experiences. Again I had that strange feeling that I was being watched, even though my Auntie was upstairs and my cousin was out with her friends. I ignored this for a while. But at one time I was in the hall and my Cousin and my Auntie were talking in the kitchen with the door closed. I noticed that the sitting room's (which is hardly ever used even though it is fully furnished) door was open, so I closed it. I went into the kitchen to get something and the door was open again. So I closed it again and went back into the kitchen. The next time I came out, the door was open again, and not only that, the light was on as well. Neither my cousin nor my Auntie had been out of the kitchen at this time. This time, I knew that something was not right because I had that strange feeling that I was being watched.

That same night, I went into the kitchen alone and out the corner of my eye I saw a white light outside in the Kitchen window even though it was pitch black outside. This was creepy. Later on, I had a shower. The feeling that I was being watched was even more stronger this time. Early morning the next day, I took my Cousin's dog for a walk in the Park. I was alone and I was surrounded by paths to other places of the Park. I picked my usual root, and I saw a hooded girl with a black dog running in front of her. I thought it was my cousin for a minute, but then I remembered that she was fast asleep at her home. Thinking nothing of this, I looked in an other direction. It was only like for a fraction of a second that I looked away from the girl, that I looked back and she was gone. She had completely vanished. I looked all around me and she was no where to be seen. She was coming toward me, so I would have seen her. The dog trotted past me paying no attention to my Cousin's Dog. About thirty seconds later, I looked back and the dog was at the end of the pathway I had just come from. The dog could not have gotten to the other end in that amount of time because he/she was trotting.

I just carried on walking with my Dog. I told my experience with my Auntie and she said that I must have seen a ghost. My auntie's other friend, who I am close with, senses something in that house as well.

When I came back down, me and my mother began to have weird experiences. My mother's passport had vanished from where she left it. A week later she found it in a bag in her wardrobe! This was weird. Then her oaster card disappeared for a few days. She had completely searched her bag inch by inch, where she was sure that she had left it, and it was not in there. My Mother thought that she had lost it while she was out. Then the most weird thing happened. It turned up in the bag she had left it in that she had searched! For a while she thought that it was strange, but eventually she told herself that it was just coincidence, I knew it wasn't.

About a week later my mother turned my light out when I had to go to bed. The covers on my bed were all messed up and my mother said that she hadn't touched them. When I came back out of the bathroom, my light was on and my covers had been neatly folded back! Now this was very weird. I usually get up in the middle of the night to go to the toilet, and on all of the occasions I have felt very cold when coming out. As with my Auntie's house, I felt like someone was watching me. I think that something has followed me back because before I went up there, there was nothing wrong with my house, and you hear all of these stories about spirits latching themselves onto young people because they are so vulnerable. My mother and father are reluctant to do anything about it because they don't believe me, like my auntie (only with my auntie, I think that she knows that there is still something there, but she just doesn't want to admit it). I will not dare to use a Ouija Board, it's too much of a big risk.

What to you think that I should do all those of you that read this?

Medium Dreams,"Texas, United States",Psychic / Medium,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Psychic / Medium :: Medium Dreams

I 'm going to make my introduction here short. My name is Miya, and this is an account that I share with my twin brother (he just registered here) Demian . Between the two of us, we have had countless encounters and experiences, so I would like to share one of my most confusing with you first.

A short time ago, my brother and I were living with our mother in Fort Worth, Texas, where we were renting this slightly aged, one-story house. It had been our home for quite some time, and we had known from the very first night we were there that something wasn't right.

My mother came into my room one morning and told me that she had heard something scratching at the inside of her (closed) closet door in the middle of the night. She said she couldn't distinguish what it was, because the noise didn't sound like any animal or a plastic coat hanger scratching at the door, but rather a person trying to get out. The room that was at that time hers had been added to the house as an extension recently (before we moved in), so I didn't understand how something like that could happen.

My mother proceeded to tell me that the noise was really starting to bother her, so after about five minutes of this scratching, she rose from her bed and opened her closet doors. Immediately, the noise stopped, and she couldn't locate the source of the sound.

Shortly after this, I started seeing a small boy (maybe around ten years old) standing in our hallway. The first time I saw him, I was coming out of the bathroom, and he was standing across the hall from me, grinning. The look he had on his face startled me, but didn't necessarily scare me. Because I've spent a bit of time around ghosts and spirits, I knew not to over react, so I walked as calmly as I could back to my bedroom, and then informed my twin over MSN instant messenger what I had just seen. He told me he knew about the boy, that he had already seen him once before, and that he felt that the young child wasn't going to hurt us.

I began having dreams about the boy shortly after this. The first I had was this:

I was sitting on the futon in my room, tying at my computer, when I felt the sudden need to look toward the door. When I did so, the young boy was standing there in front of my door, looking frightened. When I asked him what was wrong, he didn't say anything (we had established at some point that while the boy may move his mouth in speech, no one can audibly hear his words, and yet we still understood what he was saying). I had interpreted his silence somehow as a subconscious message saying, ""Don't go out into the hallway. He's very angry. I don't want him to hurt you..."" I didn't know who ""he"" was, but the mention of him terrified me, and I peered cautiously out my bedroom door to see what was in the hallway that had the boy so scared. There was nothing distinguished in the hallway, but the entire space was pitch dark, and upon seeing this I fled back into my room and shut the door. I turned to the boy and told him, ""Don't worry. You're safe in here, I promise I won't let him hurt you...""

2) At least one of them was violent, or disliked this boy that I had taken to.

Something told me when I woke from this dream that the ""man"" that had so wanted to hurt this little boy, was somehow connected to my mother's closet. The incident with the scratching had already happened when I had this dream, but my mother hadn't yet told me about it.

Again, shortly after this, I started seeing a figure. It was never clear to me, more like a dark silhouette of a person in their late teens, maybe a few inches taller than me (I'm 5'6"").

I never got to see this person clearly, but I saw the dark silhouette of them around the house occasionally, and I felt almost safe when they were there.

My mother had just left for work, and my brother was gone for the day with friends. It was my day off from work, so I was home alone to fend for myself. Shortly after my mother had left for work, I went out into our garage to get a frozen pizza out of our deep freezer. As soon as I opened the door (the one connecting the house to the garage) all I saw was black, and I was terrified by this darkness, so I decided against it and closed the door. However, when I attempted to close the door, there was something stopping it from closing completely. I looked down and saw some kind of gray or white sweatshirt on the floor that had gotten in the way of the door and therefore it wouldn't shut.

When I looked up, there was a man standing in front of me, smiling. The way he was dressed really confused me - He looked to be about seventeen, but his hair was long (perhaps to the middle of his back) and kept in a low ponytail tied with a green ribbon. His eyes were the most vivid shade of green I had ever seen, kind of like spring grass right after it rains. I was astonished by this and couldn't look away from his eyes for quite a while. Then when I realized that I was seated at our breakfast counter, away from the garage, I spoke to him. I asked him who he was, but I almost already knew that somehow he was the figure that I was never able to see clearly - the aforementioned silhouette that I had seen frequenting the area around our garage door and our kitchen. Instead of giving me a answer to the question, the boy just smiled and shook his head, looking down at the floor. So I decided to ask a different question. I asked him, ""Why are you here?"" And this time he looked at me, smiled, and said, ""I think you already know that...""

When I woke up, I was flat on my back, with my arms at my sides. I thought it was strange, because I never slept like that (especially on my futon) - I always slept on my side. I felt like I needed to touch my head for some reason, but when I tried to lift my arm, I couldn't. That's when I became aware of the pressure pushing down on my wrists. It wasn't painful, just THERE, and I became kind of panicky, so I opened my mouth to yell for my brother who was sleeping in the next room. However when I opened my mouth, I felt rather than saw, a hand gently cover my mouth as the pressure on my left wrist disappeared, and heard someone say, ""Shhh...don't..."" The soft, yet commanding tone of voice immediately made me stop, but my heart was racing. I closed my eyes, trying to will the feeling of helplessness away, and when I did so, I felt someone place the softest of chaste kisses on my forehead, and then all of the pressure lift, and I could move again. However, I could still feel the kiss on my forehead, so I didn't move for a while, and I could feel the air around my bed - which had grown FRIGID during this time - slowly begin to gain some warmth back.

These series of experiences are some of the most vivid I have from living in that house in Texas.

I would like opinions and comments on this - do you believe what happened to me? Do you believe that there are spirits who know, and can acknowledge the fact of their death, and still communicate with people in such an earthly manner?

If there is anyone on this web site who interprets dreams, I would especially like you to tell me what these two dreams may mean. I still never found out quite what these two particular spirits wanted from me, or why they grew so attached to me that when I left to live with my father, they went on a search for me through that house, opening doors and closing them, saying my name, and asking where I went (all incidents reported by my mother after I left).

Please share your opinions with me, or let me know if something similar has happened to you.

The Girl in the Toilet,India,Apparitions / Voices / Touches,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Apparitions / Voices / Touches :: The Girl in the Toilet

M y name is Merrisha and this is my experience. I was in the first grade when this happened. We had a show at our school for fund raising. When it was over, our parents were supposed to pick us up, but my parents got late. So I could explore the parts of school I had never seen (Our school campus is really big with many ""no student""areas).

I had barely explored when I felt I had to pee. So I when I was on my way to the bathroom, I felt an unusual chill down my back and a really weird feeling in the pit of my stomach (I usually get that feeling when I think something bad is going to happen) but I ignored it thinking I was hungry and went on.

When I entered the look, I heard someone flushing. Nobody was around, but then I thought it was the staff members. I went into one of toilets. When I came out, the flushing continued for a while. So out of curiosity, I knocked on the on the door. When nobody replied, I gave the door a slight push.

What I saw totally creeped me out so much, I felt nailed to the floor. It was a girl, about 8 years old, in a uniform, flushing the W.C. She turned and looked at me. When I was about to reach out to her she vanished...

I just slammed the door shut and ran out terrified. I just stood there for a while and heard the flushing again. Lost in thoughts, I heard my mother calling out. I was relieved to see my mother. But I wonder, who was that girl?

Old Fashion Ghost Girl Next to the TV,"Idaho, United States",Apparitions / Voices / Touches,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Apparitions / Voices / Touches :: Old Fashion Ghost Girl Next to the TV

I t all started about 3 years ago. Me and my Twin brother Zac went over to my cousin's to spend the night. Let me give you an example of what her house looks like so you can understand my story a little better: you walk in the front door and you have a choice of stairs you can take, you can go upstairs into the kitchen or you can go downstairs to the family room, that's where we were. There's a big TV set on the wall, right across from a big couch and a hall way leading to my cousin's room and the bathroom.

We went to bed at about midnight and we slept in the hall way. I woke up around three hours after we went to sleep, I looked over to the family room because I saw a light. I was kind of freaked out though because I knew that I turned the TV off before I went to sleep. I looked over there and there was a little girl standing really close to the TV with a little white dress on. What was so weird about this little girl was that she was kind of see through. I looked over and my brother and cousin were still fast asleep. I nudged my brother and told him to wake up. He did and we woke our cousin up. We knew what we saw but everyone we told just didn't believe us.

We did our research on it and it turns out there was a little house that used to be there and it burned down about 100 years ago. The weirdest part was there were twins that lived there, a girl and a boy, just like me and my brother.  It turns out that that the little girl died in the fire. We found a OLD paper in the attic. This house was rebuilt 2 years after the other one burnt down and we found a paper that said LITTLE GIRL HAUNTS OLD HOUSE. It said that this little girl walks around singing old songs and always asks where her brother is and where are her dolls, so we really freaked out.

We still like to stay up late on the weekends and see if we can see her, but we have only seen her once since then and we really want to see her again.

Taking my Breath Away,"California, United States",Misc,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Misc :: Taking my Breath Away

O ne day I woke up to go to school at around 7:00am. I walked to the door and opened it. I stepped through and felt like something had just ran through my body. I couldn't breath for a few moments, and I fell to the ground. I looked around and saw nothing, my house was totally silent and nothing was moving except me. This happened in a house where a lot of strange things had happened to me. I no longer live in that house, but yet I still feel as though someone is watching me.

So what's your explanation of what you think happened? My thoughts are either that I am HAUNTED or it just happens that I live in haunted houses. Or that maybe someone or something is trying to tell me something or trying to protect me from bad things. But whatever it is, sometimes it scares me and at sometimes I feel as though I'm being protected by someone or something. Kind of like the feeling of when your little and your parents try and keep you safe, so that you never get hurt.

Loud Bangs,Canada,Misc,"T o start off, I should explain the situation. Over this past summer, I barely spent any time home, and I spent a lot of time at my friend Elijah's. His house has a weird vibe to it and he's told me about some weird things he has seen/felt. Well, there was a span of the summer where I spent 4 straight days over at his house. And the first two nights were weird. On the first night, around 2 a.m., we were awake playing PS2. He was playing a game, while I was on the phone. The room door was shut, but we plainly heard a loud bang come from the basement. We first passed it off as something fell over, but ten minutes later, we heard another, louder bang. We decided not to check, and passed it off. We stayed up, got no sleep, and went down to the basement before his parents woke up, around 8 that morning. Nothing was out of place, so nothing could have fallen over. We didn't know how to explain it, so we thought ""why bother"". He booted up the computer, while I went to a fridge in the back of his basement to get a drink. In the minute I was there, I had the feeling I was being watched. I went back, and Elijah was still in the chair by the computer. We went out with a bunch of friends to kill the day after that and came back around 10. We went into the kitchen around 12 to get some food. While looking through the fridge, I saw something move quickly behind us out of the corner of my eye. Elijah saw it to, cause he whipped his head around to check. With that, we said ""nuts"" to the food and went into the room for the night.

Small Mansion Built in the 1600s,"Ohio, United States",Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: Small Mansion Built in the 1600s

I t all started when we moved into our new house. It was left for my dad when my Grandma passed. The house was a small mansion built by my ancestors. It has been in our family ever since the 1600s. It's a 3 story house with a balcony on the second and third story, and a fountain in the middle of the front yard that doesn't run. The history of the house was very graphic. The house has been passed down through the generations. The ghosts that haunt the house and my family were the very first ones to live in the mansion. The ghosts: Henry the father, Samantha the mother, and their children, David (18), Abigail (15), William (10), Elizabeth (8), Herald (6), and Marie (5) Marrow (I added this information just in case it was important).

According to the history, Henry became very sick and ended up being demon possessed. As the family tried hopelessly to save him, he told David and Abigail that their deaths would be the most brutal. Then one night, as the children were sitting in the parlor, a gunshot was fired. Indeed, it was Henry. He had shot and killed Samantha. As the children tried to escape he killed them off one by one. I'm not got going to give the details just of how graphic it was. After Henry killed everyone in his family, he went out in the backyard and killed himself.

Now back to this time period. A short time after moving in, my parents and I were sitting in the dining room eating dinner when all of a sudden, the table started to shake violently. After it stopped, I looked up and saw something run past the archway. I got up and dashed over to where I saw it, but it was gone. I am an only child and the only pet we have is a cat. The size of what I saw was at least 4 ft. Tall, so I couldn't imagine what it was.

The next night, I was in my room alone. I was getting ready for bed and I accidentally knocked something off my dresser. I bent down to pick it up and it suddenly became cold. I stood up and in the mirror in front of me, I saw what was actually David, standing behind me. I didn't know at the time that this was David. I had no idea who this person was. Scared out of my mind, I turned around and he was gone! I rushed down the hall to my parents' room but they were already asleep.

The next day around lunch, I heard heavy footsteps going up the stairs. I looked around the corner and there was no one there, so I just went back to what I was doing. About to minutes later, I heard it again upstairs right above my head, as if someone were walking around. My parents had already gone to work so I thought someone had broken in. I crept upstairs with a stainless steel candleholder in my hand. I walked up to the door and busted in and all the noise instantly stopped. I started to wonder if maybe the house was haunted.

That night after dinner, my dad walked into the kitchen to get something to drink. My mom and I were still seated at the dinner table when we heard something break against the floor. We went in the kitchen to see what happened. My dad was standing there with the broken glass on the floor next to him. My mom asked what was wrong. He said he saw a little girl sitting in a puddle of blood. He said she had bloody cuts all over her and her eyes were completely white. We all had trouble sleeping that night.

At 12:09 am, I was laying in bed staring at the ceiling when out of nowhere I heard a little boy laughing. I sat up and it stopped. I lied back down and rolled over to face the wall. After laying there for about 2 minutes, I heard my door creak open and footsteps coming up behind me. I rolled over and it was David! He was standing over me trying to tell me something. He had short black hair, old-fashioned clothes, bloody and ripped to shreds. His skin was gray and he to had bloody cuts on his arms and one on his for head above his right eyebrow. His words started to make a little sense now. ""Help uu-s he he's co-me-ing he'll ki-ll he-'ll ki-ll."" And just like that he vanished! I was so scared! I grabbed my baseball bat just in case something tried to kill me. I ran down the hall and burst into my parents' room. They weren't asleep yet. They asked me what was wrong. I asked them if they had seen or heard anything strange. They both replied no.

That's when I decided to research the history of my house on the computer. After I learned everything I realized why their ghosts would still be in our house. They were tortured and killed... completely innocent... murdered. We're used to it now. I must say I've had a lot of different ghost experiences, but those I could tell later. Still to this day our house is haunted. Like my mom seeing a dead boy in the bathtub, and my cousin hearing a girl crying in my closet.

There are so many things to tell that I can't fit into this story. Feel free to tell me what you think. I hope you enjoyed it. It is all 100% true and if you don't believe it than that's ok too.

Just Before His Passing,"Pennsylvania, United States",Family / Friends Visits,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Family / Friends Visits :: Just Before His Passing

M y Father passed away on 4/29/06. He was 77 and was suffering from COPD; that day his heart heart finally gave out. A few days after his death, I was talking to my sister-in-law and she told me that a few weeks before my Dad passed, the last time she had seen him, Dad called and asked how my niece was and asked when they would be coming next because he had not seen her in a while. It was quite a coincidence that my sister-in-law was home, she was usually at work, and also she was off work that weekend and was thinking of taking a drive to my parents' house. They came that weekend and my Dad spent the day with his pride and joy, my niece. That was the last time he saw her.

There was some weird things that happened, but we only realized after the fact, around the time of his death. The day my Dad passed, we received a call from the hospital at about 9:30 AM. He was requesting that his wife come to the hospital. I drove my Mom there and my Dad requested to leave, he looked rather scared. He then asked me for some coffee but I could not oblige due to his condition. My Dad said that if he didn't leave, he was going to die and I advised him if he did leave he WOULD certainly not make it. At that point he asked to be put back on assisted breathing and we agreed he would be more comfortable. My Father, who was not very religious, began blessing himself repeatedly and looking more and more ""concerned"". As the doctors were switching him back to the machine, he expired.

A month after his passing, my Mother decided to make some changes around the house. She painted the living room and was very upset and concerned that my Father would not approve. Also, I had recently bought a dog which my Father had forbade me from getting for a decade or more. That night, as I slept, I saw my Father sitting on his recliner in our living room. On his lap sat my new dog, Murphy, and he spoke to me. He said, ""Tell your Mother the walls look good...""

Though none of these fall under the standard definition of a ghost story I thought that my experiences did give more examples that there is something else out there when we move on. And there is more than one way for our friends and loved ones to contact us.

Poltergeists?,"Nevada, United States",Poltergeists / Physical Manifestations,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Poltergeists / Physical Manifestations :: Poltergeists?

I was home alone ready to go to school that morning. I was left by myself because my Mom had gone to work and my brother was already at his school. Before I get in my shower, I always turn on the TV, just so I could hear noise, because I never really liked silence.

As I turned on the TV, I noticed it was a show I didn't care for. The show was 6teen and it was on Nickelodeon. I turned off the TV and decided to just take my shower. About 20 minutes later, I got out and noticed my TV was now on and it was on the News talking about a murderer under a girl's bed. I suddenly felt a cold breeze down my spine and I quickly got dressed and ran off to the bus stop. It doesn't quite stop there though...

Later that night I was getting ready to go to bed, it was around 9:30 p.m., I was walking up the stairs, and we had a stairway in our new house, and as I hit above the stairway ,I heard a pounding. It didn't freak me out that much... But then I began to hear other noises such as whispering. I was left alone that night since my Mom and brother had gone to a concert and I walked downstairs for food. I knew I left my door closed so my cats wouldn't escape out of my room, I came back up and my door was open. I NEVER leave my door open because my cats would get out and claw at the furnish. I'm not sure what to think now and it still even freaks me out.

Hopefully it's not just my mind playing tricks on me because that rarely happens...

Small Entities With Pointy Hats,Australia,Psychic / Medium,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Psychic / Medium :: Small Entities With Pointy Hats

T his is my friend's story and I'm not sure I should repeat this because she said to me that I should tell no one but I'm worried for her.

Now this girl let's call her ""Faith"". Her grandma is a witch (I don't know what type) and Faith's grandma says that she is also a witch, but Faith doesn't want to be one, so she ignores her grandma. In Faith' house, there are two things that she calls gremlins, but from what I have heard about them I don't think they are. Faith's say that they are small and have pointy hat/heads. Sometimes they leave red marks (she says that it like a liquid blood) on the floor but that disappears on its own. The things speak English because one day she was lying on her bed and it touched her on her leg so she kicked it. She then heard it say to the other one ""you! that person on the bed she kicked me!"" The other replied ""serves you right"". Her house also has 5 what she calls ghosts. Faith only told me about three of them, one stands outside her window and points at her for some reason, she thinks that one want to kill her. The other one look like a boy from school. One of them is nice to her and has blue eyes and the other is angry with her for some reason and has red eyes. They follow her to school. She's the only one that can see them but there are real because one day we were talking about them and a rock comes flying at me and hit me on the back and no one was there. The ghost with the blue eyes said that she was one in a million, saying that she could freeze water and stuff like that. It also kissed her. I think maybe that ghost at the window might be a host but the other to I'm not sure.

The Vanishing Coffee Mug,"Hawaii, United States",Family / Friends Visits,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Family / Friends Visits :: The Vanishing Coffee Mug

A fter many years of being bed ridden because of a massive stroke that she suffered early in her life, my grandmother had mercifully passed on. Not long after, my grandfather gave me some items belonging to my grandmother, some of which were family heirlooms. The most valued item (because of its sentiment) was a Japanese wedding obi which my grandmother wore over her wedding kimono. Several years later, in 1978 (I was eighteen years old at the time), I sold the wedding obi to an antique dealer. At the time, I knew it was wrong to do so, but I sold it anyway because I needed some money. My god, I sold it for only $45.00 dollars. That was one one of the most stupid things that I have done in my life, and I regret it every day.

One of the other things that my grandfather had given me was this old bluish ceramic coffee mug decorated with images of daisies. It was my grandmother's favorite coffee mug. One day, not long after I sold the wedding obi, the coffee mug disappeared. I know for a fact that I put it on the second shelf in the cabinet above the stove. I looked everywhere for it because it had also become my favorite mug, and I used it quite often. It just vanished into thin air.

Two weeks after the disappearance of the mug, I was watching a television show with my girlfriend in the living room. We were laying down beside each other and I remember it being about 12:30am. All of the lights were off except for the illumination of the television. Then out of the corner of my right eye, just above the hallway entrance, I saw a dark object appear on the wall. It just materialized out of nowhere. At first I thought it was one of those large cockroaches that I refer to as a 747. All of a sudden, it fell off the wall and dropped straight to the floor. It made a loud (crack!) sound as it hit the tiled floor. When this happened, my girlfriend and I flew straight up into the air like a startled cats.

I turned on the lights and went to see what the object was. My girlfriend then asked me ""what's wrong?"" to which I replied ""what do you mean?"". She told me that all of the color had drained from my face and that I looked very pale. My girlfriend was looking at my face the moment that I picked up the object, and realized that it was the ear/handle belonging to the ceramic coffee mug. I knew that the ear/handle belonged to the mug because I recognized the color and the partial daisy image that decorated the middle part of the ear/handle. I could not find any explanation for this occurrence, nor did I recover the rest of the ceramic coffee mug. I guess my grandmother's spirit was very upset with me.

Tennis House in Mount Street,Australia,Poltergeists / Physical Manifestations,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Poltergeists / Physical Manifestations :: Tennis House in Mount Street

W hen I was 2 years old, my family and I lived in an old house in Kew, Victoria. It had 2 tennis courts and we lived at the house rent free as it was given to my mother for getting the job as caretaker of the local church (I can't remember events personally but these happenings are what my family members have encountered in the 2 years we lived there). Right from the beginning, things started to go weird, you would always hear tennis balls on the court when no one was there. One night, a shelf in the hall way had been thrown over and down the hallway. The room my parents put me in was always cold and I always screamed and when mum would come to get me I would be abnormally cold. That room eventually became the spare room where family visitors would stay. My cousin complained of the bed shaking, my aunt woke in the morning to find a lump on her head and my other aunt woke in the middle of the night screaming that she saw a green colored man at the foot of her bed. My dad had strong vibes not to go into the room and when he eventually did, his newspapers would be thrown everywhere. There's more to tell but no room left. Can anyone shed some light on this house at all. Very curious to know what happened there.

Grandmother's Message from Beyond,"New York, United States",Family / Friends Visits,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Family / Friends Visits :: Grandmother's Message from Beyond

T his is a true story which happened fifteen years ago. One day I came home and found paramedics on the living room floor trying to revive my grandmother. Twenty minutes before, my mother had entered her room and found her with her mouth wide open and a ""strange"" look on her face. After trying to rouse her and getting no response, she called the ambulance.

Paramedics tried for about an hour to revive her, to no avail. We were informed that she may have been dead for much more than the fifteen-minute limit during which CPR is considered effective. And so she was declared dead and shortly thereafter officials from the coroner's office arrived and took the body away.

Several hours later, returning home from our relatives' after informing them of grandmother's death, we opened the door to our apartment and, much to our disbelief noticed, on the floor in the middle of the living room, a white pigeon. At first I was afraid, but then my mother told me not to worry, that that was ""abuela"" (Spanish for ""grandma""), and that she was trying to send us a message. It calmed my nerves a bit, though I still decided to take a trip to the grocery store while they dealt with this surprising guest.

My grandmother had professed interest in the supernatural throughout her life. Often as a child I'd go to her after dreaming the night before and ask her for the meanings behind the dreams, and she'd proceed to tell me. For example, I once dreamed that I was running from an angel. She'd later tell me not to worry, that it meant that I was being taken care of by a higher force. But her uncanny abilities weren't limited to dream interpretation: Once she told me that the Mets would win the World Series after trailing and coming back, and gave me a final score, which was very close to the actual one.

We no longer live in that apartment. It goes without saying, however, that I still get chills whenever I think of that day. Was it my grandmother, trying to send a message from beyond? I'm convinced that it was. Wherever she is, I'm sure that she's happy, and I'll never forget our encounter with the bird fifteen summers ago.

My Encounter on an Indian Military Ship,India,Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: My Encounter on an Indian Military Ship

T his is a true story...though I still can't believe it happened to me. That's the time when I used to serve on ships in capacity of cadet that was my first and last F.G. Ship (F.G. Stands for Foreign Going). Ship's name was M.V. Spar Ruby. Whole crew was Indian. I still remember, march-2006, we were passing through North Atlantic, heading for Trieste, Italy. We were carrying wheat, in that passage maintenance of hatch covers was due. Hatch covers are opening of holds in which we carry cargo (wheat), same like cover of some box. Weather was very fine so hatches were partially open for no. 1 hold which is located in the foremost part of the ship and painting work was going on, as we could not finished whole on that day, it was kept open so that paint can get dry underneath the cover.

At around 10:30 at night, chief officer rang in my cabin and asked me to close the hatch. I changed in my shoes, took a torch, and informed the bridge (from where control of the ship is done) that I'm going on deck. After reaching there, I started the Hyd. Pump and start closing operation, I closed one cover and went forward to close other, suddenly my torch went out of order, rather than going back, I informed bridge on walkie-talkie to switch on forward lights, 3rd officer was on watch and he informed me that it'll take 2-3 minutes.

Meanwhile I lit one cig, I was enjoying the puffs, when suddenly I heard some scratching noise behind me, I thought there was some malfunction with hatch cover and I turned back with usual alert, but I got completely got frozen to see the view, there was a lady standing in some light clothes, she got short hair and her face was not so clearly visible, I could not understand how I was able to see her in such a dark. I could not make a single move, I wanted to shout but such a thin voice was coming out of my mouth. Suddenly she started moving towards me, I wanted to move back but my foot became like they are nailed on deck. She was continuously moving towards me but with a slow speed, she took around 30 sec. to cover the distance of around 15 yards between us. Now she was close to me like hell. Her face was just 5 inches ahead of mine and I saw her very thoroughly, she was such a pretty lady of about 35, maybe from some South American country. In spite of her beautifulness she was pale yellow. Most strange were her eyes, which were carrying sadness of whole world. Until I got comfortable with the situation, all three lights of fore part were on, I moved my head towards the light in anticipation and in hardly a sec. I looked back to the lady, GOSH no sign of her, I lost consciousness...

I came back with my mind; chief officer was bending over me and asked me softly as I opened my eyes. Chief Officer was a nice guy; he didn't ask a single thing and told everybody to leave the room so that I can rest. He instructed the duty seaman to take care of me in 2-3 hours interval.

Next day, I told everything to chief officer innocently, he told me not to take such things to heart, as it happens due to heavy workload on ships. Even I didn't take that incident seriously and forgot like a horrible dream.

Mid of April, next month, we had just loaded steel coils from Alexandria, Egypt. We were heading for U.S. It was my duty to go inside the hold everyday to take temperatures. It was 4th day from departure, in the evening I was doing the job, almost finished, I entered in no.5 hold, reached to the bottom, put thermometer on floor and start noting the readings. All of sudden I don't know why I turned back; same lady was sitting in the space between two coils. Same outfit but today she was weeping, I clearly could see the wet face. I gathered all my courage and asked her who she was. No answer... I again asked but nothing, I don't know how I could be so brave, I shouted on her and that should have been avoided.

Suddenly ship started rolling, we were in Mediterranean Sea and that was so unexpected. That can be dangerous due to shifting of steel coils, so duty seaman who was outside the hatch took down some steps on ladder and shouted to come up, again that attracted my sense and as I looked back no sign of her.

After that incident that lady became part of my life. She started to appear in the accommodation also. First I saw her near crew's toilet after dinner. After some days in the radio room. Frequency of her appearance increased. I thought this is high time to do something because that was affecting my work also. Thousand of times I asked her ""what you want"" ""in what way I can help you"" ""I have done something wrong with you"" But no answers.

She uses to continuously stare at me. I told everything to 2nd officer now, who was comparatively close to me. He took everything seriously and makes report to chief officer, who was apparently angry with me due to my frequent mistakes in work. He told that I'm pretending to get away from work. 2nd officer was not happy with this because he knew that I'm sincere with my work. Though he was not believing stories completely but agree that something wrong is happening with me.

That day he called me in his cabin and we had some vodka, in that drunken state I started crying and told him that maybe this is all psychological but all is true. And why it is happening to me, I didn't even see the face of that lady before in my life, I haven't done anything wrong with any female in whole of my life, and all that. In that state I left his cabin and came to mine. I just fall on my bed and went to sleep.

After midnight I felt that somebody is pulling my bed sheet forcefully, I woke up and that was worse, she was standing in front of me, lights were on and there was mere distance between us. She was in bluish gown today with some Arabian style of small cap on head. In few moments my body was wet and I felt that my body was heavy, that I can not make a sheer move. My hands started shivering. She took some steps forward, came close to me, sit on my bed and put her hand on forehead. After that she said something in some strange language with a pleasant smile on her face. I could not understand a single word but had a feel like she is saying, ""don't be scared of me, I'll do nothing"" ""sleep, you need that"" she started massaging my forehead softly with lot of love and affection in her eyes.

I forgot all my stress. She was continuously saying something like some lady singing a song for her baby. Her voice was soft and touching. I closed my eyes and suddenly the scene came across my mind when I was leaving the home and my mother was weeping and I saw her face for the last time. I started crying; she quickly got up from bed and went in the corner of the cabin. I asked her to come near but she was so scared like she has done something wrong to me. Suddenly she crossed the bulkhead (partition or separation between two cabins) like a smoke and disappeared. First time I saw a supernatural thing.

I started crying heavily, not because of fear, but this time because she was gone; also some drinking effect was there. Though nobody was able to hear that at that time of the night, but Captain was just passing by, he heard the sound and came inside my cabin. Seeing Captain in my cabin, I stopped crying due to his image but tears were continuously coming out of my eyes. He asked me what happened but I was not able to tell. He took me to his cabin, offered me some coke. He talked to me on various topics and after soothing me a lot, he finally asked me the reason why I was crying as he was expecting this due to some homesickness. I told him the whole story, he was quite angry with chief officer not reporting him such a serious incident. Captain was catholic from Mumbai. He told me not to worry and gave me some religious literature with instructions to use. After that we saw a movie in captain's day-room. In morning, 4 clock, I left the cabin and after getting fresh went on bridge for my watch (my watch timings were morning and evening 4 to 8).

I was quite fresh with new energy, c/o (chief officer) asked me about the change, I told him nothing. From that day onwards I was no more scared, though I strongly believed that some aroma or some energy or something unnatural around me every time. I felt that I'm faster, more powerful, smarter, more enthusiastic that anytime. Every thing was going just great. Everybody was happy with me due to the change.

One evening captain asked me if everything is going fine and after that he advised most shocking thing; ""PRATAP, do not whistle on ships anytime"" And that picture flashed before my eyes when I first saw that lady, while smoking, I was whistling loudly as that is in my habit that if nobody is around me, I start whistling.

I was shocked. But after that, everything was not that bad at least. That great soul was not at all dangerous though she brought me a great change. I never think of her or call her as some devil or 'bhoot' or something like that, though she's been a great memory to me.

It's now almost six months, I left Spar Ruby. Due to my mother's constrains, I'm not allowed to join back and that was my last F.G. Ship. I still remember that gorgeous face with big blue eyes with endless affection.

Unexplained Noise and Movement,"Ohio, United States",Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: Unexplained Noise and Movement

I have had several 'ghost' experiences throughout the years. The first being when I was about four -I was sitting on the toilet and I started yelling for my mom because I saw 'smoke' in the bathroom. My mom came running in, and she saw it also. They checked the entire house, trying to figure out what it was. There was no explanation for it. I maintain that it was a spirit (as does my mother).

Several years later, I was fourteen, and out at my grandmother's house. It was an older farmhouse -built by my great-grandfather in 1945-46 (he also had died in the house... He suffered from seizures -in that time they didn't know enough about them to help him. He was placed on the floor of the living room, where he seized until he passed away). I was up in my grandma's bedroom, talking on the phone to a friend. I was laying on my back on the bed, facing away from the door. She had wooden beads hanging from her doorway, and I heard them rattle. I figured it was the dog, but I turned and looked over. Hmm. Nothing there.

I went back to my conversation, assuming the dog had went back downstairs. A few minutes later, I heard a noise like a pop can crunching. I again turned, figuring the dog was in there after all. But he was a German Shepard -not exactly hard to miss. There was nothing.

At this point, I was getting a little anxious. I sat up, and kept glancing around the room. The top light was off, but it was in the middle of the day, so I wasn't too concerned. I started telling my friend about what was going on, when I heard the noise. The dormers of the house were deep. Deep enough that you couldn't see all the way into them to the windows. The curtain rods were metal, and the hooks on the curtains were also metal. They were rusting and pretty old. They scraped horribly when you opened the curtains. I heard the 'scrape... scrape... scrape'. And my eyes went to the wall where the sunlight was coming in. As each scrape occurred, the swatch of sunlight got larger. Someone was opening the curtains.

I threw the phone, and ran into the hallway then down the stairs.

There stood my grandma at the kitchen sink, elbow deep in dishwater.

She said she wasn't, and I knew she wasn't. There was no way she could have made it down before me, or made it out of the dormer without me seeing her. There was no one else in the house, and the dog was laying in the dining room. The window wasn't open, so the wind couldn't have blown the curtains -furthermore, there was no way it could have- as I said the rod and hooks were rusted, and took a considerable amount of effort to move them.

I told her about what happened, and she very calmly replied, ""We've got spooks..."" And went back to her dishes. I do believe she was right.

Levi,"Ohio, United States",Family / Friends Visits,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Family / Friends Visits :: Levi

I give this spirit a name because we maintain it's Levi. A few things had happened. The basement door opened... The smell of a man's cologne... The sight of a man out of the corner of your eye... Lights flickering...

One day I turned my head and watched a man in a tweed jacket walk into the spare bedroom. Moments later, I smelled cologne. Levi was a man that had worked for my step-grandparents until he passed away. We think it's him because as my step-father was explaining what my mom and I were seeing, his mother said, ""I bet it's Levi..."" It was like she knew in her heart it had to be him.

Levi had always been very peaceful -he'd just stand at the junction of the basement door and the hallway, and he'd watch you cook dinner, or do dishes. He had never given off a threatening vibe, so we didn't mind. If we'd sense him, we'd say, ""Hi Levi..."" He'd stay a little longer, then disappear.

One day, my mom and I were in the basement, and one of the lights started flickering. Hmm, maybe the bulb is loose. It wasn't. And there had never been a history of bad wiring. Some of the others flickered once in a while, but it was mostly just the one. My step-grandmother had been telling us a little about him, and one of the things said was that he loved Christmas. It was his absolute favorite holiday.

Ironically, on that day, we made a connection. The light that almost always flickered was the one above the Christmas decorations. One day, my mom and I both sensed that Levi wasn't quite happy. We went about our business. I was in the kitchen, and my mom was in the basement, ironing her clothes for work. I heard her talking, so I knew she was acknowledging Levi. A few minutes later I heard a ping, and then glass hit.

She came flying up out of the basement, frazzled. The light over the decorations had started flickering, so she said hello to him. The light went dim, almost completely out. Then came back on, slowly, up to full force, then brighter. She told him to stop, he was scaring her a little. It dimmed again, then got bright, then dimmed, and she again told him to stop. More forcefully this time. As she did, the light bulb went completely bright, and the bulb bust.

That was at the point she took off up the stairs. She told me what happened and then said, ""Levi, I've never minded you being here, but you can't be mean. Don't you ever do that again. You scared me..."" We were both hit with a whiff of cologne, then it dissipated.

A few days later, we hadn't seen anything out of him, so I figured my mom made him mad and he left. Who knew? But I was down in the basement doing laundry, and saw something out of the corner of my eye. It was like... a cloud of dust almost, and it drifted straight across, coming towards me. I saw it, and started for the stairs. It went through the sunlight coming in through the basement window, and as it did, the cloud rearranged itself and formed a face. I turned my head from it as it moved faster, and ended up walking right through it. I ran up the stairs and glanced back, and the cloud was dissipating... But didn't drift to the floor... It kind of just... Disappeared.

We haven't seen anything out of Levi for quite a while now. But every once in a blue moon you'll catch him out of the corner of your eye.

Frequent Night Visitors,"California, United States",Old Hags / Night Attacks / Sleep Paralysis,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Old Hags / Night Attacks / Sleep Paralysis :: Frequent Night Visitors

I have experienced something very similar to a story titled - Night Visitor . I have had night visitors every so often over the years, and more frequently for the past 2 years. I'm 27. My visitors always seem to be somewhat threatening in their actions. Choking, shaking by the neck and shoulders and what seems to be an attempt to ""pull the covers off or pull me out of bed"". I Googled ""Night Visitor"" on May 8th, because 2 weeks ago an older woman told me she had a visitor that was trying to choke her. I had never related my choking encounters with her... She just brought it up to me the Saturday morning after it had happened.

She awoke, told her husband who did not believe her, went to the kitchen to drink a glass of milk and went back to sleep.  It happened again. She did the same except for the milk, she drank some tea instead. Went back to bed and it happened again!

Then just this last week while visiting the place I grew up, a friend's daughter who is 17 said an ""entity"" has visited her many times... Trying to hold her down and or choke/shake her by the neck. After hearing the above stories from my friends just recently, I am beginning to believe that what my husband told daughter, may be true... The ""invisible side"" may be reaching out to us for some type of help.

They have experienced an ""entity"" trying to choke them and other types of encounters that made them afraid. The middle one, 23, has experienced it over 9 times. The youngest, 22, experienced it only once. Both of them claim they think/feel like they are ""awake"". My husband has had a lot of experience with this since he is always there sleeping next to me when it happens to me. He has never had it happen to him. Nor ever seen any one in the room when I awaken him in the middle of the night.

He told his middle daughter after her 8th episode, ""that maybe the 'entities' are ""crying out for help"" or are trying to get someone's attention ""on OUR SIDE of the veil"". ""The invisible are maybe trying to make contact with the visible due to some unknown reason on their side"", is what he relayed to her. He told her ""next time it happens to actually stay calm, do NOT put out any fear emotions/vibrations and tell the ""entity"" very clearly that if it is their with bad intentions... To please leave immediately."" He told her then to say to the ""entity"", ""But if you ARE HERE BECAUSE YOU NEED SOMETHING, I WILL DO ALL I CAN TO HELP YOU!""

About a month later it happened again... But after saying what her dad had instructed her to say... She experienced something very different. She said ""she definitely felt it was the presence of a woman... All the other times the entity had been aggressive which made it seem masculine in nature."" But this entity was very gentle with her. It caressed her head, played with her hair by pulling it back and running her hands down the length of the hair... Even though she was lying on her back. She had a sense of oneness with the ""female entity"" that she said ""I have never felt with any visible person."" The experience lasted about 5 minutes. Since it is a 3rd party story... It would be best if his daughter actually wrote about the exact details of what she experienced that night.

She is currently out of town but I will contact her and tell her that I have found this great site to post her experience on. She will have it posted by May 15th under the title - ""FRIENDLY NIGHT VISITOR""

Any one who is Registered can feel free to write me at my email on record.

The holding down/choking/shaking by the neck, seems to be happening ONLY to women... IF ANY MEN HAVE HAD THIS TYPE OF CHOKING ENCOUNTER... Please add your experience to this thread. Thanks!

PS: We should NOT fear something, simply because we do not understand it.

The Real Nightmare,"Oregon, United States",Old Hags / Night Attacks / Sleep Paralysis,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Old Hags / Night Attacks / Sleep Paralysis :: The Real Nightmare

O ne time, when I was living in Montana, I had some ghost experiences. It all started when I was eleven years old, I was going to bed early. I was not feeling real good. I fell asleep right away. I dreamt of a man who was chasing me. He grabbed my arm. I then woke up. When I woke up I felt as if someone was really grabbing my arm. I could not move my arm. It was being pinned down. A few minutes later, it let go. My arm could move. I thought it was just in my mind from my dream. I looked at my arm and I saw figure prints. In the morning I told my mom. She had a similar dream. I had it for several nights in a row. We moved out of the house. I never knew what it was about.

No I never experienced it again since I moved out. I still have experiences with ghosts. In the house I am living in now, every night I feel like someone is watching me. There is a black figure in my room. At night, I can never fall asleep. It feels like someone is on top of me. I can never move. It happens every night. No one believes me. One of my friends said an old couple lived here. The man killed his wife. She died in the bedroom which is my room. It is a weird feeling. My mom does not believe me. We can not move. I need advice from people.

My Friend Is Visiting Me in my Dreams,Georgia,Family / Friends Visits,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Family / Friends Visits :: My Friend Is Visiting Me in my Dreams

I am Haley from Georgia and here is my story! It happened when I was 8 years old. I lived in a small neighborhood when I was little. Everybody knew everyone. It was very peaceful in that neighborhood. But one day a girl that I knew got killed down the street from where I live. She was a very close friend. She died from being burned in a fire.

The next day I had a nightmare about her. She was trying to come in my house. And I was telling her ""no you're dead!"". Then she kept saying ""Oh, no. I'm not dead but you are..."" I said to her ""Of course I'm not dead you died in a fire..."" but then she said ""I know you're alive but you're going to be with me soon!"" Then I woke up screaming my head off! I ran to my parents room and they comforted me and I went back to sleep.

She was a very close friend and she was very nice. I kept having the same type of dream every single night! Had the dream, woke up screaming, parents comforted me. Same thing over and over! I didn't want to do that the rest of my life! So I did something about it! In my dream when she said ""You're alive but you're going to be with me soon..."" I got out of bed in my dream and carried her to the graveyard where her grave was, and put her where she belonged. Those were the scariest dreams I have ever had! Was she trying to tell me something? What do you think?

My Haunting Experiences,"California, United States",A Haunted Life,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: A Haunted Life :: My Haunting Experiences

I 've experienced ""hauntings"" in two family homes. It started when I was 14 while I was taking shower. A cold breeze hit me and at first I thought nothing of it. I felt it again and a weird feeling came into the pit of my stomach. So I got out, grabbed a towel and my clothes and went into the bedroom to dress. While I was drying off/dressing at super speed, something I couldn't see let out a nasty growl on the right side of my mom's bed. I ran out of there.

Later, my bed began to shake at night. I thought perhaps it was me being paranoid and shaking therefore shaking the bed. So I had my brother sleep with me. He woke up before me and then woke me up because he felt the shaking. After that, me, my brother, and sister all slept in my mom's room with the door closed and locked. I would hear things moving around in the front room, see shadows in the hallway, hear whispers...

I was home alone one day and brought my dog inside. I was too scared to go alone to the back bathroom, so I had my dog wait outside the door. There was a loud crash noise from my room and my dog ran away. She wouldn't go back there again.

After we moved from that house, other neighbors started hearing things. This was my first but not the last experience. We later moved into a house a family friend lived in. For awhile I was okay, but then I began having nightmares of things attacking me, making me not able to speak or move. It was horrible. One night a friend stayed over. I never told him anything involving my experiences with ghosts. He saw something in the hallway from my room and asked if my house was haunted. Alarmed, I asked ""WHY?"" He had seen the figure of a black man looking into the room. I was so scared. I liked to pretend I never felt anything in the house. But once he told me this, I couldn't just ignore the ""problem"". His friend came over to pick him up and couldn't believe the activity/evil that was in the house.

He told me two dogs lived there among other things... I have seen one of the dogs on two occasions. Both times I thought at first it was my dog, but quickly realized it wasn't. The first time I saw it, I only caught a glimpse of white legs and paws. The second time I was getting into the fridge and I glimpsed a white dog face to my right. For once, I didn't feel threatened by a spirit.

Later on, I could hear knocking and scratching on the walls coming from outside. There was a loud vortex like sound coming from the backyard. My dog would bark and freak out sometimes. I thought it was odd that never once did my family wake up from him barking. I became too scared to fall asleep and would stay up all night and wait for day break to go to sleep. I later found out from my friend's friend that he just ""knew"" the land I lived on had been a landfill sometime ago. It didn't register to me until I remember a neighbor boy telling me this same thing a couple of years before he stated this.

I now live in apartments by a cemetery (nice choice huh?) and have a daughter. Sometimes she'll watch something in the apartment that can't be seen and laugh or just stare. It scares me for I don't want her to be able to feel/see the things I do. It's awful and horrifying.

Another experience I had was in Fairfield, CA at Rockville Cemetery. A former boyfriend took me there late one night because he was bored. The second I stepped onto the soil I got a bad feeling from the place. I felt as if I was being watched, followed. I didn't see anything or hear anything, but that feeling was overwhelming and I made him take me back to his house. I will never again go back there, a lot of people from the area have told me stories of their experiences. It is a very haunted place.

These are my stories, though they do lack some detail. I became an insomniac and developed a phobia of people breaking into the house and of spirits. I have to have an animal with me wherever I live, for I believe if there is something there, they will know. I sleep only against a wall with my back facing the wall for fear of something coming up behind me and touching me. I could go on and on.

If anybody knows of hauntings in Red Bluff, CA, please let me know! Thanx

"Seeing my Dogs, Always",Georgia,Pets / Animals,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Pets / Animals :: Seeing my Dogs, Always

M y name is Haley and I'm a mother of two kids. Annabelle and Alex. Annabelle is 7 and Alex is 11. We had two dogs Hannah and Liz. Hannah was a Yorkie. Liz was a Corgi. We got them both on the same day. We had them for 2 years. They both died because of rat poison. We were so sad after they died. They were very great dogs.

I was brushing my teeth. Then out of the corner of my eye I saw Hannah. She was whining. I screamed and my husband came up and asked ""What happened?"" I said ""I saw Hannah! She was whining!"" My husband then looked around and he saw nothing... ""Oh my Gosh! I see Liz in the window!""

After I saw both Liz and Hannah. We moved. To get my mind off of them. It was peaceful at our new house. I was still unpacking the boxes of stuff. And I grabbed a whole bag full of dog treats! I thought I threw them all away. I turned around, headed for the trash can when I saw Hannah looking through the window with Liz. I was shocked! I told my family what happened. They told me they haven't seen Hannah and Liz. They thought I was just seeing them because I missed them.

We then got a new dog. Her name was Lucy. She was a Golden Retriever. While I had her I didn't see Hannah and Liz. I wondered why. Maybe if I had a dog they wouldn't show up. After that I knew to always have a dog. I still don't know if I was just really missing them. Or not!

Weird Happenings,"California, United States",Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: Weird Happenings

I 've been living in the same house (duplex and rented) for about 10 years. I moved in with my parents, brother and sister when I was five. I always have had weird feelings and, being a girl, I always follow my intuition. Oh thank goodness for it!

Since we moved in, I have had really weird experiences. From lights randomly turning off, to flicking, to hearing foot steps, to feeling just weird stuff. When I was little, I was terrified to look in the mirror at night. Unfortunately, we had this huge drawer that had an even bigger mirror in it. I had never attempted to look in it at night because of my intuition. One night though, I did. OMG! I got so freaked out because there was someone right next to me! I freaked out so bad! I started praying to God because I was so scared. My mom, being all Catholic and stuff, put up a Maia de Guadalupe and a Last Supper portrait since I used to be religious. I had to pray every night as it was the custom and I would always end with a ""Please God, please protect me...""

As I grew up and finished my ""Primera Communion"", I started to lose the faith in Catholicism. I was more into God than anything else. I figured that praying to all those other fake minor saints and stuff was useless since things kept happening to me. For example, I would be taking a shower and hear the door open (the doors all creak) or I would hear a drawer open and close. I would never see anything though, just hear.

As I grew older, I got more into ghosts and the paranormal. I have always been scared of going in the garage which is also the basement. I get this feeling that I'm being watched. My dog Kiwi came with me downstairs. I was going up and I kept getting this feeling that something was watching me. I was rushing up the stair and something black rubbed against my leg and went running towards the door. I thought that it was my dog so I said ""Kiwi!"" then, I got to the top of the stairs and saw that my dog was sleeping! I wanted to scream but I couldn't. I rushed to the kitchen where my mom was cooking and told her. Her eyes widened and she said ""Oh man, maybe something is haunting you..."" but she was just playing around. I was so scared.

I've had more experiences which I will write about tomorrow...

A Raging Spirit,"California, United States",Poltergeists / Physical Manifestations,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Poltergeists / Physical Manifestations :: A Raging Spirit

I t started in Jan 2006. The first ""sign"" was a jar of peanut butter, found on the rim of the kitchen sink, on its side with a big glop of peanut butter on the counter, and a dripping pool of melted peanut butter on the floor. I thought it was the kids being messy. That was the beginning of a year of dumping, spraying, spilling, slashing, cutting, bashing doors, leaving slippery traps, playing with the electricity.

The first 2 months of 2007 were the worst. It moved furniture. It threw everything it could at my daughter's door, including knives, cans, pots and pans, dishes. It wrote on the walls, it hid things in the vents. We couldn't keep toilet paper, paper towels, soap, shampoo or any kind of personal need in the house. Every time we bought toilet paper, it would dump it in the toilet. It took cell phones, the first was put in the toilet. The second, mine, was dumped in my coffee cup when I fell asleep.

It put the third in the peanut butter jar. It banged on the walls, killed kittens, made us sick with fear and frustration. It punched holes in the bedroom doors using an 8lb mallet, bent the doorknobs. It put fingernail polish inside the lock mechanism of the door knobs. We would go out a door, it would lock it behind us. It destroyed my dishwasher, plugged up the sink and flooded the house.

Every day was some attack in one way or another. We would set the air conditioner at 81 degrees, it would set it at 79. I would turn off the AC at night before bed, in the morning it would be turned on and set at 79 degrees. There were so many things that it did, vile, vicious attempts to interfere with every aspect of our lives. It took every can or jar of flour, salt, coffee, tea, spices, sugar and piled it on the floor, over and over again. It took packaged cake icing and flung it around the living room, on the walls, ceilings, floors, next would be the goodies it found in the cat boxes, anything it could find in the pantry, was dumped, spread or flung about the house. It poured oil on my computer. It would set traps, such as balancing an egg on the bathroom door, that would fall when moved, or piling cinnamon and sugar on the ceiling fan, and when we walked into the room, would start the fan. It would put a lighter in the coffee pot (twice) which would explode. The second time, it blew the coffee pot apart.

We never knew what we would find when we opened a door, picked up trash or walked down the hall. In the beginning, some of the outrageous things it did made us laugh. We stopped laughing very soon. It started to attack our electronics. My brand new flat panel computer monitor was slashed several times. My daughter's brand new Dell had shaving cream sprayed inside it, and other things we have yet to identify. Several times, in a matter of 10 minutes of leaving the keyboard of the computer, we would return to find piles of cat feces placed in perfect round piles on the keyboards. We would find my daughter's bikini underwear up in the branches of the big pepper tree in our front yard.

We have over 500 digital photos, videos of the vicious attacks at my daughter's bedroom door. We reached out, we contacted people. We had an investigative team come up from the San Diego area 5 times with all of the latest equipment. Their conclusions were vague, but informative. There was no solution to our ""manifestations"", only advices. We had a cleansing, it didn't work. Our family dynamics didn't permit the unity needed to make this thing go away.

In March 2007, when my daughter was asleep, it spread toilet paper and paper towels all through the house and set 2 fires underneath them. That was the final straw. We could no longer put off our fear. We moved out. It tried to kill us. We had to move, we feared for our lives. We are trying to heal. We'll never forget.

Highlander,"Minnesota, United States",Psychic / Medium,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Psychic / Medium :: Highlander

F or those of you who have seen the movie ""Highlander"" and the way in which the immortal characters in that movie can sense one another's presence before they can actually see one another, this is the best way I can think of to describe what would happen to me between the ages of 20 and 25. I would be walking down the street, at a concert, in a coffee shop, at a ball game, just about anywhere... And all of the sudden it would be like a homing beacon went off in my head. I could be in mid-sentence having a conversation with a friend, and all of the sudden my hearing would change, I would be tingling all-over, and I would immediately turn in a particular direction to face someone, some THING, staring directly back at me. Sometimes he/she/it was 15-20 feet away, sometimes they were 50-75+ yards away. However, it was almost as though I could both see and sense an evil presence in human form. It was very unsettling each time it would happen, as you could see the ""evil"" inside of them, along with the darkness or hatred in their eyes. Why I was chosen to have those experiences I have no idea, but it is not an experience I care to repeat anytime soon. The last time it happened to me was eleven years ago, which is just fine by me.

A Voice From Beyond,"Idaho, United States",,"I n January 2003 on the tenth of the month, my girl friend, that I was going to marry, past away from lung cancer. Before she died, she told me that if she could contact me, she would. A little over a month later I came back to my apartment about 11:30 pm. As the latch on the door clicked, I heard her voice say, ""If you go to Jackpot tonight you will win big..."" The hair on the back of my neck stood up and I got goose bumps all over. We use to go to Jackpot, Nevada from time to time and 10 months before she had won almost $7,000.00 on a nickel slot machine. I had promised her that I would buy her a head stone as her family could not afford to get her one. Well to make this a little shorter, I got in my car and drove the 90 miles to Jackpot and got down there at 1 Am. At 4:30am I hit a jackpot for $3,743.00 and over the next hour I hit two more jackpots for $1,000.00 each. I came home with over $ 5,000.00 and the first thing I did with the money was to buy her head stone and I helped her kids by putting an inscription on the back side of it.

She may be gone from this Earth but her spirit is still with me and I feel her presence all the time. She will always be with me even if I should find someone else to love.

Ghosts Are True. Believe It or Not!,Australia,Family / Friends Visits,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Family / Friends Visits :: Ghosts Are True. Believe It or Not!

I bet you sometimes ask yourself, are ghost real? Have you ever wondered to yourself and asked yourself where is that thing I put down in that spot and now it's gone. I know I put it there, or I know I seen it there. Mysteriously it's gone. Well let me reassure you that, yes, they are real. I asked myself this question many, many times throughout my life and I always thought that maybe they are true or maybe they aren't! The day came that I can now swear to you, cross my heart, believe me it's true that I have experienced a couple of situations that I have now come to realize that Ghosts DO EXSIST on this planet...

I was brought up in a family of seven children, I was the second eldest. Lived our lives on farms in old houses, not rich and not poor either. I used to think I was imagining things throughout my life and wondered if I truly saw the things I thought I saw. I began to doubt my self.

When I was married and had children of my own, we moved into my husband's grandfather's house. His grandmother passed away in the house years and years earlier, and his grandfather passed away in hospital. We moved into the house, I was cooking dinner one night in the kitchen and out of the corner of my eye I saw two ghostly figures gliding past the kitchen door, it looked like they were holding hands, but that was what I saw out of the corner of my eyes. I looked in at the door and I walked out and looked around to where I had seen them, I walked out to where they had gone and I couldn't see anything, my husband was in the lounge room and that was where the ghost had came from, I asked him ""did you see that?"" he replied with ""what?""

I told him what I had seen and he just looked at me. I thought to myself if this were real and I truly did see this then it must be grandma and grandfather and at least they are together now. I was not spooked but it answered my questions, ghosts are true. Strange things happened in this house, we heard things, we came home to the microwave being on one afternoon, there was nothing in the microwave, it was turned off but it was going. I called out to my husband and we both stood there looking at it trying to figure out what the heck was happening. We looked at each other and thought ""unplug the damn thing"". That is what we did.

Sometimes we woke in the mornings and the fridge was opened and at night when we went to bed we would hear footsteps across the floor, my husband woke one night and said he saw his grandfather standing at the fireplace, I used to sometimes lay in bed and think I seen something and felt the presence of something in the room but I just chose to ignore it and believe to myself it wasn't going to hurt me...

This is so true and I have chills down my spine. Believe me. This is the first time I have ever shared these stories. But as I have learned to live with these ghosts I always believed that they will not hurt you and that they just want to share this world with us.

Accept it and let them live. We can't get rid of them and they don't want to hurt us. We will all be ghosts at some time.

Two Shadowy Kids,"California, United States",Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: Two Shadowy Kids

T his happened when I was about 12 or maybe 11 years old. I was at home on both occasions and there was a lot of light. One day, I was in the kitchen, my sister was really little like maybe 5 or 6 years old and my brother was around 9 or 10. I was naturally taller than my brother and my sister was shorter than my brother. It was a bit late and so we were sent by our parents to brush our teeth. We only have one bathroom so we would usually all go in the bathroom together and brush our teeth together. There's a really long hallway from my room (which I shared with my sister and brother) to my parent's room. In that space between my room and my parent's room, there's the kitchen, bathroom, 2 closets, and the entry door to our house.

So, first I made my way to my parent's room to say goodnight to them. I thought I heard my brother and my sister leave so I was like ""Oh, okay..."" I started walking towards the bathroom and in the wall between our pantry closet and the kitchen I stopped for no apparent reason. I looked up and I saw the light of the bathroom on and two shadows. One looked like my little sister and the other like my brother. They were holding hands. I thought ""Aw... That is so cute!"" I turn to the kitchen and my brother and sister were still in the kitchen! I obviously didn't say anything to them because I didn't want to freak them out. I went to the bathroom and nothing was there. I thought that it wasn't like a bad omen or anything though because it was just little kids.

Another more recent time, I saw another shadow. It was last year. I was in the kitchen and I was helping my mom cook. My mom told me ""Go get me a can of tomatoes from the closet (pantry)"". I told her ""Okay"". I went to the pantry and felt a bit colder. I also noticed that I kind of hesitated to go in the pantry. I said to myself ""C'mon! What the hell would you be scared of? There is nothing there!""

So I go inside and I turn to my left to get the canned tomatoes. Then, I saw a shadow the size of my sister run towards my parent's room. At first I freaked a little. I sprinted back to the kitchen and I asked my mom if my sister had run towards her room. She told me no. My sister was in the kitchen the whole time and hadn't run. I told my mom about what happened and she thought I was playing around! Ugh! I was so mad! I knew I wasn't just seeing stuff! Well, this is my second story.

I kind of know by now that the little shadows are probably kids but I don't know the history of my house. I don't really know how to look it up so could you guys help me?

Faulty Wiring,"Oregon, United States",Misc,"O ne night, I was lying in bed when I realized I needed to use the bathroom. Getting up, I shuffled down the hallway to our small upstairs bathroom. I noticed that the bathroom door was shut but the light was off so I thought nothing of it. I went to open the door but I suddenly heard a loud sound of someone clearing their throat. I figured it was my uncle who had recently moved in with us and decided to wait for him to get out.

I waited in bed for 10 minutes and finally decided to just go to sleep. A few hours later I awoke again and went to get out of bed when suddenly the bathroom lights began to flicker madly! I stepped closer to the hallway when I heard and loud crash in the bathroom and wondered what had happened. I peeked behind me and looked into my brother's room to see him fast asleep. Figuring it was my uncle again I walked up to the door and said ""uncle Gary, what are you doing?"" There was no reply. I stepped back and heard a faint gurgling noise. Listening for a moment I realized it was my uncle snoring fast asleep in his room! Terrified I ran into my brother's room and climbed into his bed for the remaining three hours until morning.

When morning came I asked my mother if she had used the bathroom. She said she hadn't, so I asked my step dad and he told me he had gone to the bathroom. So I asked him why he hadn't responded when I asked him what was going on, and why was he flickering the lights. Then he asked me, ""what are you talking about? I used the bathroom down stairs and I didn't do anything like that..."" Since then we have moved but every night I still check the bathroom before using it.

Did It Really Move?,Liberia,Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: Did It Really Move?

W hen I was 9 years old, I was playing with my father's mobile phone and I was in my room playing with it. I put it down on the floor next to a piece of paper I had drawn on earlier and went out to get something to eat. When I got back, the phone was next to my texters about 3 footsteps away from the piece of paper where I left it. I was sure I left it next the paper. I ran out to my father and told him. He said that I was being silly. I knew it had moved. I went back upstairs and it was next to the paper again. Then I started thinking maybe I was being silly. Maybe I was just seeing things. So I decided to go back down and tell my father.

I started walking down the staircase as I heard my mother and father talking. I stopped and bent down, looking through the bars and listend. They were talking about the little girl who used to live here before we moved in. My father said something like this: ""we can't tell Abi about Ruby because if we do she will get scared..."" and my mother said: ""well if Ruby's silly parents locked her window that night, that man wouldnt've climbed in and killed Ruby, now would he?""

That's then when I knew someone had climbed in the window in the same room as I was in now, and attacked the little girl Ruby. I went back up into my room and walked over to the window. It was open. I went to reach out and shut it but it slammed shut. There was no wind outside either. I knew it was her. I screamed and my parents ran in and I told them I overheard them talking. They settled me down and that night I couldn't sleep. As soon as I closed my eyes, the window slammed shut and open and shut and open over and over. I screamed and my parents came in and the next day we moved.

I am now 14 and still think about it every night. And every night I walk over to my window and lock it...

My Brother's Demon,"Nevada, United States",Apparitions / Voices / Touches,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Apparitions / Voices / Touches :: My Brother's Demon

T his all started when we moved into our new house, we have a lot of weird things going on here. I live here with my mom, step dad, younger brother Darian, 13, and youngest brother Devon, 11, we first started feeling things when we would go into Dev's room, it was always colder than ours, and darker, and it never felt quite right to me. But we would stay in there none the less because it's hot in Vegas... And his room was always much colder than the rest of the house.

When you would go into his room, a wave of unease would just wash over you, it was hard to breath, I've always been a little sensitive with things like that, and I'd had numerous encounters with things of this nature. It unsettled me to no end to feel that THIS was much worse. Sometimes when I would walk in there to watch T.V with my brothers, I would get a horrible pain in my arm, leg, head or stomach, so I limited the time spent in there and stayed in my room, which always felt cozy and safe.

Everything started getting a bit out of hand, when my friend Gena came over after school one day. She is a bit on the sensitive side as well and I wanted to see if she felt as horribly as I did when she entered the room. Sure enough when she walked in, she felt uneasy and wanted to get out... But at the same time we wanted to KNOW who or what was in there.

So we went about making our own ouija bored. Bad Idea #1. We sat on Devon's bed and proceeded. Darian, Gena and myself, Devon had stayed at his mom's house with a friend, we talked for whatever it was that had contacted us through the board. We asked it its name. It spelt out a series of letters we couldn't keep up. Then it said ""Ray"". We talked to it. It claimed to be a demon. Shortly after that I got a sharp pain in my head, Gena told me to grab my crystal and go in my room. I did and the pain quickly subsided.

Later on we decided we were brave enough to try a seance... Bad Idea #2. We chose the garage. We made the circle of salt, joined hands. We decided to call him... Ray. It got cold, it got REALLY cold. And my cat Mystique went insane, she's also my familiar, she was inside, desperately scratching and meowing desperately at the door. What I chose to see, might not have been what my brother and Gena saw. I saw a man, tall, hair slicked back, but it was long, and his jaw was bristled with hair. I couldn't see his eyes, I didn't try to look at him directly, more like PAST him to see my brother.

It turned towards me, I still made no attempt to look at its face. At this point... I was TERRIFYED. I got a hideously sharp pain in my stomach, like someone was turning all my guts inside out. I thought I would die, the pain was unbearable. I was crying in agony. Gena told us to picture it going back into the room and being locked in there. We did, we broke the circle and went inside. Sometimes when I go in that room, I get chills, or when I'm just passing it... but... I know, I never want to experience that ever again.

Bad Experiences at Night,"California, United States",Old Hags / Night Attacks / Sleep Paralysis,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Old Hags / Night Attacks / Sleep Paralysis :: Bad Experiences at Night

S ince I was 14, I have had dreams with unseen entities in them. My dreams are so real, taking place in houses I lived or live in, or rooms I've slept in. I can never see these ""things"" but know exactly where they are in my dreams and can hear them. Sometimes they talk, though I can never remember what they say. I try to scream and cry out for them to leave me alone. Sometimes I try to call out for god to help me, but he never does. I am paralyzed and can't speak. It's as if they take away my ability to make a sound. One time, one of the things got into my mind from my ear. I shook it out and woke up. Sometimes when I am just about to fall asleep, the atmosphere will change in my room and I suddenly jolt awake. It's like my body becomes hyper sensitive to my surroundings and is open to other worldly things. I used to have to battle these things taking over my body. I would throw fits in my sleep and thrash my head around trying to keep them out. I know for a fact that I have done this because an ex watched me do it once and it freaked him out. I don't understand why this happens to me. I want it to stop but am not sure how. I thought I could turn to god for I truly believed he could help me, but he never once made them go away.

Are they really spirits or demons that take the shape of spirits and other forms? I'm lost and scared! Please give me advice!

T his is my son sitting in the floor, opening his christmas gift. This was taken christmas 2001 at my mother in law's home. The tv was off, we sent the picture to be developped, when we got our picture back, there was a man in the tv. It looks to me like the guy was looking over my son. We don't know who the guy is. We sent the picture to ghost hunters and they said it was something, but I forgot what she called it. No one in the family know who the guy is. I told my mother in law it had to be someone from their family because it was not my house, it was her house. But why would this guy be looking over my son for? We lost his great granny that year and him and her where very close to each other, she called him her baby boy. She always worried over him.

Flamboyant Apartments,Puerto Rico,Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: Flamboyant Apartments

T his happened in an apartment in the daytime, around 2:00 PM. My daughter was getting ready to iron. She placed the ironing board to its position, and searching for the iron, which she already plugged and turned on to iron. However, she could not find where she placed it. She kept searching and could not find it. Then she stopped and something made her to look back. She told me, a small boy handed her the iron. The boy had the hot bottom of the iron placed on his hand and handed it to her. She took it. Then she came to my room and told me just what I am stating. I asked her if she was afraid. She said, ""No, because he seemed very friendly...""

I asked people about the place. They told me there was a little boy that had died. However, he did not live in the apartment I was living in... This apartment and few occurrences, but not too many. One friend stopped by with her baby. The baby started string at the hall wall. He was giggling. There was nothing on the wall, not even a picture. It was bared. My friend told me she thinks it was her late husband. Well I don't know, what it was. I couldn't see it as other times.

Once a friend had slept over, I slept with my daughter. Suddenly she came to the room looking alarmed. She told me a passed boyfriend who died in an assault came to her. She saw only half of the body floating. He just stared at her. The next day, her new boyfriend came over, shaken, and told us that during the night, he saw a man, floating and told him to take care of her, he will be watching.

How more coincidental can that get! Believe me, incredible things can happen.

In this building, there were a lot of talks about strange occurrences. A tenants move to the first floor. In this apartment, the teenage kid was fine, but then seemed to be ill looking, got very skinny. Then I heard it was due to strange things in the apartment. He seemed so weak. He said he would hear voices, appliances turned on, well, common ghostly activities. They bought the apartment, then they decided to sell it cheaper. The kid was deteriorating. Hoped he got better.

That is why when one want to seek new living house or apartments, please seek info about the area and previous residents. One can avoid a lot of problems.

Strange and Horrific Faces on my Walls,"California, United States",Photographs / Videos / EVP,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Photographs / Videos / EVP :: Strange and Horrific Faces on my Walls

I moved into this house 3 years ago with my 14 year old daughter and my husband. Soon after we were settled in, my camera phone on a flook took a picture of the carpet in our bedroom, the face were horrific and scary, I started looking with my camera phone all over the house and sure enough there are faces and illustrations throughout the entire home, on all the carpets, tables, all furniture, walls, any thing and everything, I have spent countless hours trying to make sense of this but cannot. The bricks in the fireplace have faces and illustrations, I have taken numerous photos, put them on the computer and used programs to enhance and remove layers, there are people, working, animals, etc... Strange as it may sound the faces change from one day to the next.

Outside, the bricks on the house also have faces and illustrations even all the rocks outside do to. If you pick up any piece of paper and start coloring the paper faces appear and words. Someone came here one day and said a horrible feeling went through his body, he was shaken up quite a bit and never returned.

I was raised in a christian home my parents are still ministers, I called my dad he advised me to take blessed oil and put some all over the house on every door and window too which I did but this is still going on...

I have a 4 and a half month old son who is always looking at certain areas in the house and laughing or smiling, and when he was 2 months old I discovered a really strange thing, when the baby is crying and nothing we do can calm him down, if I walk into the kitchen and stand in a certain spot he instantly ceases all crying, now that he's teething it is even a greater phenomenon that that still works, I know something is going on here I just don't know what...

Dad's Humor,"New York, United States",Family / Friends Visits,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Family / Friends Visits :: Dad's Humor

M y father had a fabulous sense of humor. He was my hero when I was a child. He always knew how to make everyone laugh. My Mom died when I was a teenager. He and I were left and shared many experiences. I was feeling afraid of being without him. He had been a strong powerful person. He was 88 and dying in 2004. It was hard to see him succumb to lung cancer. At one point he looked around the room and said... ""Wow I created this"". It was as if his soul was speaking to me. It surprised me because he was not a religious or spiritual man.

He told me his favorite memory of me and asked my favorite memory of him.

I was thrown by that question. I have great memories and wished I could have thought of a better one than this one. I literally didn't know what to say. I should have said the sound of his voice singing in the shower. But all I could think of was this. I was trying to keep the mood light. I asked him if he remembered being angry with a neighbor that allowed his dog to ""go"" in front of our driveway? My Dad took the dog doo doo on a shovel and put it in front of the mans doorway so that he'd step in it on his way out. My Dad said, ""I am a dying man and you're talking about dog s__t?""

The night before his funeral, I asked for a sign that he was o.k. I was staring at the shadow of the window blinds on the ceiling. I woke up and went to the window to open the blinds and there on the sill were two pieces of my cats' doo doo (with litter stuck to them). My cat was elderly and unable to jump up that high. There was litter stuck to it. How is that possible? It was my Dads' humor... I am SURE of that! I put the 'you know what' in a plant because I couldn't throw it out.

I know he would enjoy the fact that unbeknown his 3rd wife, the funeral director, who knew my Dad, gave me his ashes. My Dad wanted to be cremated and scattered over the Hudson River. The day we were to bury his ashes (her wishes), the funeral director gave me a bag when she wasn't looking. It was my Dad's ashes. I took the ferry boat (that was named for his cousin) and was able to give him his wish. I think he would've enjoyed that he was in my purse at a luncheon with the 'step family' before I was able to grant his final wish. His name may be on the tombstone but he is where he wanted to be and I can see the Hudson from my hall window!

The Black Cat,Grenada,Pets / Animals,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Pets / Animals :: The Black Cat

W hen I was younger, I liked to go 'under the cocoa' (Creole Engish-Back Yard Garden). I still do. There are many trees up there, but there is one that blossoms very often, twice yearly. This is the plum tree. I love plums.

One day I went to pick some, I think it was a Sunday and plum season was coming to an end. I pick what I could and ate them on the tree. When I came down I saw a black cat. I never saw a cat so black in my life, it did not even have speck of white or any other colour, just completely black.

When I saw it, I said ""Oh no"" because I knew if my three beautiful cats saw that black cat, it could be dead meat, so I threw a stone at it to frighten it away and make it run off for its own safety, but in return, I was the one that got frightened. When I threw the stone at it, it ran into the bushes so I waited to see if it would come out to frighten it again, but instead, the stone I threw was thrown back behind me. I ran down to my house in fright.

Luckily, the house was close, so I did not fall while running to break anything. Was the stone really thrown by the cat? I may never know. But I know it was not someone, because the bushes were to thick, and even if it was I would have seen them.

The three cats I use to own died, but and one of them was older than me. It was a year older than me. It died at the age of 11. The other two cats was its sons. I can not remember when they died. I have two cats now, they are the descendants of the three that died. May 16th is one of my cat's birthday, it will be three and my cousin's birth is two days after.

Some of my Supernatural Experiences,"Illinois, United States",Psychic / Medium,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Psychic / Medium :: Some of my Supernatural Experiences

H ello! I have had many paranormal experiences throughout my lifetime, and some close friends including my husband, believe I have a psychic ability. I would like to start with my most recent events and work my way down if I have the room. Earlier this week, I had a dream with my deceased Grandfather who died in 2004. In the dream, he was holding my newborn son, who I am still pregnant with, and I knew in my dream he was a spirit. The next day, my Grandmother, (his ex wife) had a bad stroke and is currently in the hospital. I have a feeling that his visiting me, was to forewarn me of what was to happen, and to let me know he will be watching over his great grandson when he arrives.

Besides the usual psychic experiences I have, I believe in the supernatural and have done a great deal of reading and learning on the subject. My current home I live in with my husband is haunted. He has lived here for a while and has told me of light bulbs constantly blowing up on him when he would freshly change them, and the distinct movement of a dark shadow behind him. These events haven't happened to him in a while but they have happened to me since the second day we moved in.

That second day, I had no clue that any of these things had happened to him. I was feeling very lethargic and decided to try and take a nap in our bedroom. Now our bed was located right next to the doorway so you would have to wait until someone walked into the room to know who it was. As I was saying, I was laying on the bed, home alone, and I heard a car door slam right outside in our driveway. I thought that was odd because no one that we knew would be visiting us. After this happened, our side door opened and I heard footsteps walk around our kitchen! I did not know how to react because I thought it was a burglar at first. I just laid in bed frozen from fright of being attacked and/or killed. Finally the footsteps stopped and I waited. I grabbed a heavy object and snuck out into the kitchen, only to find no one there. If the person had left I would have heard the door close again. But I heard nothing.

A while later, still shook up, I returned to bed and started reading a prenatal book. Again, I heard the side door open from the outside and a person walked inside. The footsteps came right up to our bedroom doorway and stopped. I was so scared that I couldn't move. I looked but no one was there. Suddenly my cat jumped down from the bed and ran into our hallway and stared intently into our bathroom which is right next to our room. I was so scared I called my husband at work and told him and he laughed and said ""I was wandering when you would experience something!"".

Since this experience I have had a few others here. Nothing as scary as that, but I soon started seeing dark shadows pass out of my peripheral vision. We will have items disappear from where we thought we put them, and show up somewhere completely different. Too much creepy stuff.

Before living here and meeting my husband, I was a maid for Merry Maids. We had a ton of houses to go to on a weekly basis and a few houses I have been in once and that was it. One house in particular was of an elderly gentleman who lost his wife quite a few years ago. He lived alone in his home and we came there weekly to clean. While I would be cleaning, I would get the impression that someone or something was watching me. I asked my maid partner if he had cats or anything and she said no. So every time I would be vacuuming a room or cleaning the shower, I would have an intense feeling of being surveyed. I ran out to my partner and told her about it. She said that she has never experienced anything like I have, but she has gotten bad vibes from there.

He was a sweet old man and I'm sure his wife was too. I just somehow got the feeling that she wanted the home left alone, and disapproved of my presence. I've had other experiences at other houses, but I will write them at another time. I still have more to tell from my high school years at my parents home.

My parents home is relatively small and was built in the late 1970's. My family is only the second or third that has inhabited the home so I never thought to experience a ghostly experience of any kind.

One day after school, I was reading my English homework and was home alone. To my right, in the doorway to the kitchen and the living room where I was, I heard a man and woman standing 6 feet away from me and bickering to each other intensely. I couldn't decipher what they were saying because it was kind of muffled, but it was right next to me! It was like recorded in time! My dog sitting at my feet got up and stared at the area and barked and growled like crazy. I checked the entire house to see if we had any tvs or radios on, but nothing.

A few months after that occurrence, I was at home, and my father had just left for work. I was then left home alone and was in my closet searching for a pair of shoes. My closet door was right next to my bedroom door that was opened. I then heard my father's heavy work boots walk down the hallway towards my room and they went into our den instead and the door slammed shut very hard. He had already left so I said ""Dad did you forget something?"" And I did not get a reply. When he didn't come out after a few minutes, I thought it was odd because he was going to be late for work. I opened the den door and he was gone! No one was in there. I looked outside and his truck was still gone, he never even came home! The window was closed so there was no draft for the door to slam shut as hard as it did.

Sorry this is a lot of things to read. I will write again later when I have more time. I have had more experiences as a maid, and throughout my life in general.

The New Big House,"Florida, United States",Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: The New Big House

T his happened in Jacksonville, Fl when I was about 11. I lived in this huge house that my grandparents paid for. I had always wanted to live in such a mansion-like place, but my sister resented the idea totally. The first few days were fine, except I was separated from my sister for once, and I thought I kept hearing noises, like creaks, giggles and footsteps outside my door. I told my mom about it but she said I was hallucinating. I hated when my mom didn't believe me!

The following week, things got more strange. I always felt cold and as if someone was watching me. Every time I took a step, my shadow would always be a half-step behind me, which wasn't supposed to happen. But the strangest thing was that I would set things down, like, for instance, my mother and I would be baking, and I would put down the mixing spoon for a second to grab the eggs, but when I gave them to my mother, the mixing spoon would be gone, and I would find it later, in the fridge, or on the ground. I was totally freaked out by the time a month passed. I couldn't go to sleep, because I heard childish laughing, and creaking, and my door would open, but I couldn't convince my mom to move out!

Finally, the ""things"" attached. The invisible monsters hit me, and tried to smother me with my pillow, I screamed and screamed, and it finally stopped once my mother turned on the light. My sister checked me for damage, and I was covered in wounds and red marks. I still have scars to prove it. We moved out the following day. Even though 4 years have passed, I never forget to lock my door.

Missing Objects,Canada,Misc,"A couple of weird things have happened recently involving items disappearing. I go to sleep knowing the last place I left the object, but wake up to find it missing. Usually happens after I have had too much to drink but they are things that are so habitual, I know exactly what I do with these things. First my glasses. I will take them off and put them by my bed, on my dresser or in the bathroom ALWAYS. I wake up they are gone. I looked EVERYWHERE behind, under in stuff, I cleaned my whole room... Gone. Still haven't found them. The next one is an even more personal item. My rings... I have 3 turquoise rings I ALWAYS wear, I take them off only for work. When I take them off, they go in the pocket of my pants I'm wearing and right back on when I'm done work. Or in the little pocket in my purse. I never take them off for any other reason... To shower or when I go to bed. The strange thing is there is a new ring I got to remind me of a friend of mine who passed. I take this one off leave it around, etc. But the other 3 I have had for years... Family gifts. So this morning I wake up and the 3 turquoise rings are gone. Right off my fingers... While I slept! But one ring was left, the one that was to remind me of my friend.

So either I'm sleep moving stuff, one of my roommates is screwing around with me, I have a ghost or when the aliens abducted me I left that stuff on the ship, or I'm losing my mind... Any thoughts?

The Guy in my Recurring Dreams,"Texas, United States",Misc,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Misc :: The Guy in my Recurring Dreams

H ello, I'm a 17 year old girl who goes under the alias laelah. I'm a devoted firm Christian who has had some supernatural experiences in my life. I need some help figuring out who or what this one dude who keeps popping up in my mind and my dreams is. I have even heard his voice once or twice when I was by myself. He looks like he could be Italian, Greek, or something from the Mediterranean area. He looks about 6'4""-6'7"", like I said before he looks Mediterranean, has shoulder-length jet black hair kept in a ponytail, and oddly these lime green colored eyes. He usually dresses in red and black.

Every time I start to think of him or journal about him or when I wake up after dreaming about him I sense a cold, uncomfortable presence around me or feel like someone is watching me. Many times in my dreams he's tried to sleep with me. He only twice tried to kill me in dreams. I called on Jesus' name on the two attempted killing dreams and he painfully retreated. Other times I can't get rid of him, no matter how hard I try. I've heard his voice in my room two times and he said something I couldn't quite make out except something about ""asleep"". I've seen a guy who looks just like him drive by my house one night and it scared the crap outta me! Who and or what is he? What does he want with ME?

Dark Figure in the Mirror,Viet Nam,Old Hags / Night Attacks / Sleep Paralysis,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Old Hags / Night Attacks / Sleep Paralysis :: Dark Figure in the Mirror

I remember clearly about this event when I was in Vietnam visiting my relatives. I am now 21 years old. It was around April when I was either 15 or 16 years old. I remember that day me and my two sisters shared a room, they got the bed facing the door and I got the bed facing the mirror. In Vietnam, it doesn't matter what season it was, the sun will set down at around 7pm or something and it will be completely dark around 9pm.

The sun will rise up at around 5 to 6am. I remember that one night when I went to sleep at around 10pm or something. I was passed out completely sleeping on my back, so basically I can see the ceiling. Then suddenly I woke up at around 12 or 1am, I can't clearly remember what the time was. I was half conscious and half awake if that's what you call it. I couldn't move, I was calling out for help from my sisters but they couldn't hear me.

My body felt so heavy and I could barely open my eyes. But when I got it to open slightly I look at the mirror and I saw a dark shadow looking back at me. I couldn't see her, I could feel it was a girl and all I saw was the eyes, I can't remember but the eyes were either red or pitched black eyes. After all my struggling, I finally awoke after like 10 to 15 minutes from that trance like state of mind and looked at the mirror but nothing was their. It was one of those big mirrors where you can see your whole body when standing.

After that event, I never had it again when I was still in Vietnam sleeping in front of that mirror. Can anyone tell me what I've experienced?

Ghosts of a Couple,India,Apparitions / Voices / Touches,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Apparitions / Voices / Touches :: Ghosts of a Couple

I was in college and was required to stay in Bombay India with my maternal uncle. Since the accommodation was short, I was required to stay on the room in the terrace at the end of the staircase. The lights in the terrace were put off after 12 midnight. I did not get good sleep so I came out of the room and tried to spend time outside the room on the terrace. I saw a young couple standing in the corner of the terrace. I thought that they were real human beings and tried to go near them. The nearer I went to them, they vanished and that made me scared.

I turned back and wanted to go into my room when I could see the same couple standing in my way to my room. I avoided looking at them and ran into my room. I closed the door and got myself inside the bed sheet to keep myself away from the couple ghost. I had no guts to go out of the room until the sun rose on the next morning. The watchmen of the building had seen the couple ghost earlier on many occasions and they told me to avoid looking at them, ignore them and do my work without interfering with them. I feel that the couple ghost were nor harmful if you do not get into their way. If you try to get into their way they may harm you.

Girl in the Mirror,"Massachusetts, United States",Apparitions / Voices / Touches,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Apparitions / Voices / Touches :: Girl in the Mirror

O ne Monday afternoon as I was sitting in Math class, I had to use the bathroom. So I asked the teacher and she said ""Okay"". As I walked to the bathroom I heard someone creeping up behind me, but no one was there. I ignored the sound and kept walking to the bathroom. As I finished, I washed my hand, I looked up at the mirror and a girl was standing right behind me. I turned and no one was there. The girl said ""Frank"" I started freaking out, ""your mom is dead"". I didn't believe her and sprinted out of the room and went back to math.

Though the whole time I told my self not to believe the ghost but part of me told me to. As I finished class and got on the bus home I panicked even more. I went home and as I arrived the door was open... Scared to death now I walked inside the house. All I could see was my mom (on the floor). I called 911 and they came but it was too late... She was dead.

Until this day I can't believe what that ghost did. But I won't even go in the stall anymore. About a month later I moved into my grandparents house and the ghost revisited me... But I try to move on... Past the day my mom died.

So if you ever see a figure in the mirror, don't talk to it like I did. My lesson has been learned and you should follow my footsteps.

Abnormalities in my House,"California, United States",Poltergeists / Physical Manifestations,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Poltergeists / Physical Manifestations :: Abnormalities in my House

T his story is very hard to believe, but you'll just have to go with it. I'm going to say that my house is haunted. You want to know why? Because of these multiple abnormalities.

My friend Chris and I were in my house, playing Halo 2, when suddenly out of nowhere a pencil flew across the room and nearly poked my eye out. We checked around to see if my other friend, Perry, was playing a joke on us. This is no joke. We tried to set up mirrors around the house to see around corners without being in the room so we don't alarm the spirits. There was a couple of other rooms that had this. Also, I think this is not a coincidence, but you might. On the walls, there were little strokes of light and one of them was in the order of ""Yru'eo xeNt"". We decoded it only to reveal ""You're Next"". Creepy enough? How bout reaching for a box of baking soda and the whole thing moves away and falls off the counter? My house has way too much abnormalities.

Oh yeah, before I leave, one last thing is that from that pencil incident, I had a very bad cut on my eyelid. Ouch! It hurt like the dickens and it will happen again. I'm sure it will. Post comments if anything like this has happened to you before.

Ghosts at my Husband's Parents House,"Illinois, United States",Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: Ghosts at my Husband's Parents House

H i its me again! Today I am writing of a very recent event that has happened to me. My husband and I were visiting his parents for the weekend up in Northern Illinois. We usually stay on their couch in the living room, but since I'm very pregnant now, it's hard for us both to fit. So the last time we stayed, I slept on their sleeper sofa in the room adjacent to the living room. A sitting room is what I guess you could call it. My husband stayed on the couch in the living room.

That night, around 3:00 am, I woke up from a deep sleep and right next to me, was a figure of a man staring down at me. I kept blinking really hard and looking and he still stayed there. I was so scared, because the room's atmosphere changed to bad vibes. Also, he was standing where a piece of furniture was, so no human could stand there. Very freaked out to say the least, I got up and grabbed my husband's flashlight headlight, and he was gone by the time I got back. Although, he was visibly gone, I could still feel his presence there. I would try and think of happy thoughts such as friends and family to calm myself down. But when I thought about my father, the air around me seemed to feel angry again. It really scared me. I even got angry at the entity because it shouldn't get angry at my own father.

The day after this happened, I told my husband as I usually do because he always listens and has suggestions. Well it turns out that my husband's family has all seen, heard, and felt strange things in their home that is 106 years old now. He has experienced as a youngster, his door being kicked in at night while he was reading and footsteps running down their upstairs hallway. Also, both his parents have said they have seen a man who will stand at their side door on their front porch or sometimes the front door. I have seen this too twice since I have visited them over the past few months. It's usually very brief and he will walk away and disappear.

Also the next day after my scary experience, the family had a party there and I was on the staircase talking with his Aunt, who is scared of going upstairs. She avoids it like the plague. As she was talking to me, I would look up and see a shadow dart across the hallway in and out of bedrooms. It was so fast though, but a distinct black shadow.

I think with the age of the house, it is no surprise that there are hauntings that happen. Its a very cozy home and I love going there. The house has beautiful architecture and is a perfect family home. I just hope that whatever was there that night, won't haunt me like it did before. That was a little too much for me.

What Did my Mother See?,"Florida, United States",Apparitions / Voices / Touches,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Apparitions / Voices / Touches :: What Did my Mother See?

T his is my first story, it's all in the new house that we just moved into like about a few months ago, my mother has been telling me that she has been seeing things in our room, which is where my sister, cousin and me sleep in, so it kind of freaked me out. One night my mother had fallen asleep in our room, since we didn't want to wake her up, we went to watch t.v. In the living room. While we were watching t.v. my mother scared us with her screams, we ran as fast as we could to the door and asked her what had happened but she didn't tell us since she was so frightened of whatever she saw.

The next day I asked her what had happened to her and she told me only, everyone else was in my aunt's house. My mother said that she saw someone or something come out of the bathroom and (we got the master bedroom) walk to her while she was sleeping, she felt someone shake the bed and suddenly so she woke up and when she did, she saw someone walk up against her and try to kiss her or lean over and hug her.

After that day I always tend to close the bathroom door since she told me that. You never know if someone or something did it to my mother, it might do it to me to and she is christian, so it's kind of weird. I just want to know what tried to communicate or try to touch my mother.

Bloody Creek,"North Carolina, United States",Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: Bloody Creek

T he year was 1984, when my mom graduated. A guy, named Kevin, whom she graduated with, died at his house just a few weeks after graduation. He was in a car wreck, and was about sixteen or seventeen. He still lived with his parents and siblings. Hhe was driving home, even though it was really early and nobody was home, when all the sudden he lost control of his car he immediately wrecked. But the bad thing was he wrecked right beside the creek in his yard. He was seriously injured and was bleeding really bad. No one was there to help him, so by the time his family had got home he had bleed to death.

I learned this because seven years ago we became their neighbors, they still live there, but I didn't know this immediately. There were events that lead me to believe something had happened there and just a few days ago someone told me that his son had died there and the pieces just fell together. My friend lives right beside me so she comes over a lot, and we were playing in the woods when I noticed a vehicle in my neighbors yard. As we got closer I noticed there were two vehicles, a badly beaten up car and a hearse, well this freaked us out a little and I looked away, but when I looked back it was gone.

So we went inside my house. Later when the guy was out, we went over and asked him if there had been an accident, but he said no so we dropped it and he went inside. Right when the door closed, the vehicles were back and funeral music was playing. It would get really loud then really low. And there were camera flashes as if someone were taking pictures of a body that wasn't there. All these things were happening and I got scared so we went back to my house and stayed inside the rest of the day.

The next day we went back there and there was the hearse and the car, the music, and this time there was what looked like blood around the car. One minute the hearse door would be closed, the next it would be open, then it would close and open, and there were the sound of crying. We never told anyone, and anytime we would ride our four wheelers, the guy would instantly come outside and stand by the fence and when we drove by or stopped to see what he wanted, he would say these exact words every time, ""You better be careful, we wouldn't want an accident or you to get hurt..."" The way he talked was so weird that it frightened me so I would avoid going back there for a while.

But then I learned his son died there and well everything kind of came together. We still won't go back there. Other things were like the sound of a car running, then a loud crash and nothing. Just Little things like that. Also shadows, peoples voices that you don't know what they are saying. This happened a lot and it wasn't just me and my friend who saw it, it was two of my other friends too, and my cousin.

Singing Child,"Indiana, United States",Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: Singing Child

W hen I go to my grandma's house and my cousin is there, we go out in the horse field. One time when we were out in the field, I heard a little girl singing and swinging, but when I turned in the direction, there was nothing but sound. I asked my cousin if they heard it too or if I was crazy, but they said they had heard it too.

Now every time we go out in the horse field, she is there singing and swinging. Sometimes she even cries out for help, and there will be what sounds like a really bad lighting storm around this ""ghost"", but it is a perfectly clear day. My theory is that a long time ago, a little girl went outside to swing on her swing set, and started singing, then a horrible lighting storm came out of nowhere and she cried out for help, but got struck by lighting before she could be helped and now she is stuck and swings and sings all day long. Occasionally you can hear the swing creak.

There is another part to this ghost and it is the tug boat ghost. A tug boat crashed in a river the same night the little girl was outside. You can hear the tug boat coming down the river then crashing, but they are not harmful ghosts. You can sometimes hear the tug boat's horn around the time the little girl is crying for help in the storm.

Mystical Creatures,"Texas, United States",Old Hags / Night Attacks / Sleep Paralysis,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Old Hags / Night Attacks / Sleep Paralysis :: Mystical Creatures

B efore I begin with my story, here is my background. I am a female teenager in Austin, Texas. I have read many stories about ghosts and ghostly experiences. I enjoy folklore about mystical creatures and since the age of seven I have been awaiting with one such encounter. And I finally had one. It might not be the scariest but it was scary for me.

Some time around ten or eleven I went up the steps to my bedroom and laid down in bed without locking my bedroom door. As I started to dose off I heard this noise in my room like the sound of a big dog sniffing the ground. And I saw eyes. I quickly pulled the covers over my head and huddled in my bed until I felt safe. I fell asleep.

In the following weeks after I didn't forget to lock my door until that thursday. I left my door unlocked and when I fell asleep, I was woken to my bed shaking. I couldn't move at all. I was paralyzed with fear and didn't sleep at all that night, just laid in bed until morning. I was so afraid that I couldn't sleep for a few weeks after that day.

I still don't know what was happening but I can't sleep unless my bedroom door is locked and my closet door is closed.

Smelling a Ghost?,"Minnesota, United States",Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: Smelling a Ghost?

T his story is a bit strange, but we'll see if any of you have had any similar experiences. My wife and I moved into our current home a few years ago. The second summer we lived here, I began to regularly experience what I would call a strong ""old man smell"" in sections of the first floor of our home. The smell was always highly-localized (in no more than a three-foot by three-foot area), and would be found in all sorts of different locations of the first floor, but never in more than one place at a time. My wife always told me that it must have just been some random smells from an old house or a smell from outside that got in through an open window. However, the smell was HIGHLY localized (you wouldn't smell anything and then BAM, you would walk through a small area with a very strong odor). I told my wife ""I think it is one of the former owners of the home...""

After doing a bit of research, we learned that a former owner of our home lived out his final years of the home bound to a wheelchair on the first floor, renting out the upper floor to other tenants. I of course have no way of proving it, but I am convinced that it was his spirit. It was the first and only time I think I have ever ""smelled"" a presence, so I am curious to learn if anyone else out there has ever had a similar type of experience. Thanks!

Orbs at a Party,Australia,Photographs / Videos / EVP,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Photographs / Videos / EVP :: Orbs at a Party

T his is only one of my many stories I would like to tell, it might be hard to read because I was very tired when I was writing this and I'm only 13. I was going to my mates party and I brought my digital camera to take some photos of my mates. I got very bored so I started to take some really random photos. My mates house is in east Ipswich, Queensland. At her house there is a tree in her backyard. I thought I would make a great photo.

So I took a photo and when I was looking back the the photos on the camera, I noticed that it had orbs in it, so I was telling my friend about it when the girl that was hosting the party sister overheard us. She went on to tell me that their house was haunted so the girls parent, the sister and a few other girls went in to the house.

They told me that an old man had died (he had a heart attack and tried to crawl and call for help but he couldn't) where the hallway started (it use to be the front door) and sometimes they heard steps. The cats and dogs will jump over the spot we took some photos but nothing came up, the only other thing that happened that night was that my brand new batteries became flat. The photo I took can't be dust or anything because I took a couple and that's the only one that had any thing in it.

The China Dolls,"Pennsylvania, United States",Poltergeists / Physical Manifestations,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Poltergeists / Physical Manifestations :: The China Dolls

I t was a warm summer night when my friend Jen and I decided that we where going to watch movies in my room. We went down her house to pick up her VCR since I did not have one of my own. Since I lived in the basement at my house, we decide just to take the basement door from the outside to get in. We opened the basement door and walked across the basement to where my room sat.

To give a layout of the basement, when you walk into the door, you right away see the stairs to the left, going up stairs, beside you are a washer and dryer, if you walk to the right, you'll run into the bathroom. My room my located right across the doorway. The basement floor was half plywood and half concrete. The back half was concrete and that was where my room was. The concrete was separated from the plywood at least two inches apart, in the sense that they met at the same point but the concrete sat two inches higher than the plywood. In my room, my bed was against the right corner with the dresser beside it. Right next to it had a floor model television with four china dolls sitting on it. My couch my directly in front of the television. Which was right against the line on the concrete.

We get to my room and set up the VCR so we can watch ""Big Daddy"". Halfway into ""Big Daddy"" the power starts to flicker and we just figure it's bad light bulbs because the television was not affected. Out of nowhere, the all four of the china dolls turn their heads to the right to look at us. As soon as that happened, the lights (including the television) went out. We ended up flipping the couch off of the concrete and running up the stairs. None of the rooms upstairs lost power or flickered but Jen and I decided not to go downstairs for the rest of the night.

I got rid of those china dolls right after. Never again will I ever display china dolls. I can't even stand china dolls displayed somewhere else, they creep me out.

Ghost Press,United States Minor Outlying Islands,Old Hags / Night Attacks / Sleep Paralysis,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Old Hags / Night Attacks / Sleep Paralysis :: Ghost Press

W hen I was a child, my grandfather always told me about the ghost choke. It's a time at night when you feel like you can't breathe, you try to scream for help but nothing seems to come out of your mouth. Then after a while, you slowly start to catch your breath. This is what they called the ghost press or the ghost choke. Here in hawaii, we believe that it is not good to sleep with you feet facing the door, because it is believed that if you do sleep with your feet facing the wall, then you will come across the ghost press and you will have nightmares.

Recently as I was sleeping on my couch in the living room, I had a dream that I was being choked by something and I saw my mom walking to the door with a candle late at night. I tried to scream so she could help me but nothing came out of my mouth. Then I fell off the couch. And then I could breath. But when I hit the ground I woke up and I still was on the couch, it seemed as if nothing happened... So I tried falling back asleep and when I did the same thing happened. Me not breathing, my mom with the candle and me falling. I was so scared and after that I couldn't sleep. I woke my mom up and told her the story. She told me that it could have been the ghost press. I was scared...

The Girl that  Follows,"Texas, United States",Psychic / Medium,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Psychic / Medium :: The Girl that  Follows

S ince I was a little, I always used to see a girl. Sometimes she would hurt me, and sometimes try to play with me. I never knew that I was the only one that could see her. She would try to choke me at times, and I would run screaming at my mom that a girl was trying to choke me, and she would never see her. My mom did believe me, and she was scared for my life, and how this was going to affect me in the future.

So we moved from the house, and I still have recurring dreams of this girl. Sometimes, she will look just like me staring out the window of our old house. Other times, she would threaten me that I will soon bring her spirit back. I have also had dreams of waking up in that old house, and her laughing in the background. This does not only affect me but also my mother and younger sister. This only happens every once in awhile, but it still scares me to death. Ever since I had my own children, more and more things seem to happen. I had dreams of bringing the same bassanet home and putting my daughter in there. The same bassanet that would bring the girl to life.

Things like these still scare me but I try not to let it show. On occasion, I still hear my kids toys go off in the middle of the night. I just pray to God that she will soon leave me and my children alone.

A Phone Call from a Dead Friend,"Idaho, United States",Family / Friends Visits,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Family / Friends Visits :: A Phone Call from a Dead Friend

O n October 15th, 3 years ago, I and two friends drove to Boise, Idaho so that I could have open heart surgery. I needed to have four bypasses done as my arteries were 90% plugged. When we arrived in Boise, we had to find a motel room to stay in over night, as I had to be at the hospital at 6am the next morning. My mom and brother were also going to be there but they would arrive a couple of hours later.

We found a motel and checked in. We went to the room and took in our things for the night. We were sitting in the room for about 20 minutes when the phone rang and my care provider answered it. She got a funny look on her face and she said the phone was for me. No one knew where we were staying as I had not contacted anyone to let them know where we were staying. I took the phone and a spanish sounding voice on the other end asked if this was me. I said yes and he said ""don't have your surgery tomorrow, it's not your turn to die..."" I was floored, no one that knew I was to have my surgery had been contacted. I asked ""who is this?"" and he said, ""it's Oscar"".

The only person I knew by that named had died the year before of cancer. I had worked with him at the factory and he would stop every shift and talk to me. In the background I could hear hundreds of voices and I asked him where he was at and he said, ""I am in between Heaven and Earth..."" Then he told me again not to have my surgery, as it was not my turn to die and the connection went dead. I could hardly believe that this had happened and I told my friends about the phone call. I called my brother and told him about the call, they were still about an hour away from Boise, he knew this friend as he worked at the same factory as we did. He told me that I better take the call seriously and they would see us in a little while and we would go eat.

We discussed the phone call over dinner and my mother and brother both agreed that I had better talk to my doctor about it, at least about my concern. The next morning we went to the hospital just before 6am and they started getting me ready, I asked to see my doctor and they told me he would be there in a few minutes. I looked through the door a few minutes later and he was pacing back and forth in tight circles in front of my door.

Then he came in and before I could tell him what had happened, he said that my surgery had been postponed for a week and that the head doctor of the department would be in to see me in a few minutes. When the other doctor came in, he told me that the doctor that was scheduled to do the surgery had lost the last three patients he had and they were all from my area. He had rescheduled my surgery for one week later and that he would be doing the surgery.

One week later, I had the surgery and went through it with out any problems. I thank God that he allows our friends to warn us when it's not are turn to die. I also thank God for giving me a second chance and for giving us friends that care enough to change the future.

Phantom Truck in Rural Oklahoma,"Oklahoma, United States",Misc,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Misc :: Phantom Truck in Rural Oklahoma

I live out in the country, but not like the deep woods or anything. We have neighbors that live close by. Although, there is a cemetery about a mile away (walking distance). About six or seven years ago I decided to start riding my bike for exercise. Just to the entrance of the cemetery and back.

One early evening I decided to go bike riding. I decided to go straight rather than turn towards the cemetery. When I was coming back, I saw this old green and white striped chevy pick up. There was a pretty young guy driving it. I didn't hear the engine, but it was coming right at me, then it turned all of a sudden toward the cemetery. There was no dust flying up from behind it or anything. This took place during the summer, there should have been dust and the sound of a motor, but nothing!

He started to loop around and I pedaled my bicycle as fast as I could. I have never been so scared in my life! It was just so creepy. Needless to say, I never rode my bike out that way ever again.

I never saw that truck again until 2005. My sister and I were outside. It wasn't quite dark yet and we saw the same truck coming down the road. It reached my mom's house and then disappeared. We kept waiting and waiting, but nothing. We were pretty freaked out. I had just finished watching a spooky show with her and we got to talking about scary stuff. I had mentioned the truck incident to her and then we saw it. For three nights in a row it would come down the road with its lights on and those overhead lights with one light out.

Well, on the fourth night, with no sight of the truck we decided to find the truck. Fortunately for us, we didn't find it. I have not seen that truck since then. I will probably see it tonight just because I mentioned it. I'm afraid that it may be an omen or something.

If anyone from rural Oklahoma has seen a truck similar let me know. I'm quite interested in knowing it's origin (if there is one).

Courtner Road,"Colorado, United States",Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: Courtner Road

C ourtner Road in Pueblo is THE place to be on Halloween night. Everyone goes there, freaks each other out, goes home and gets drunk. That's all there is to do in Pueblo. But, on any other night, it's just a regular road, with regular houses. One morning, at around 1:00 a.m. my cousin Matt and I were goofing around after hours, thinking we were cool. We drove by the old Courtner house. It was really scary. I had been past it a few times, but I had never really looked at it. It's burnt down, and half of it is gone, but the basement is still there.

Matt parked the car. He turned off all the lights and told me the story. ""Old man Courtner lived there with his wife and two kids. He was a member of the KKK. He would kill African Americans in his basement. One day, he went crazy and killed his dog. When his wife asked him about it... He chased her through the woods around their house. Finally he caught up with her, and shot her. He shot his son too... But the daughter, he hung her in a tree, so people driving by could see her..."" I could feel shivers and I told Matt to drive the car.

He took off slowly. He glanced in the mirror to see cars behind us. He hit the breaks and smacked the rear view mirror. He looked at me and then kept driving. Nothing was said... It was too scary for the both of us. I glanced up in the mirror and saw the scariest face looking at me from the backseat. I turned to the backseat and it was gone. Matt kept driving. We were WAY TOO AFRAID to tell each other what we saw. We drove a little further, and we saw a little girl... Walking across the street in a light pink dress. I started to scream and Matt swerved so he wouldn't hit her. We wrecked right in front of the tree that Courtner hung his daughter in.

I checked the gas gages before I passed out. They were flying from 20 to 90. Back and forth. Matt was flying around the entire car. I had my seat belt... For some reason, it unbuckled and hit me in the face. Just before I hit my head on the dash I saw Courtner. I know it was him. Standing in front of the car. Our car jolted, and I was knocked out. When I woke up, Matt was sitting motionless in the driver's seat. I asked how long I had been out. ""Only a few minuets"" he said. He got out of the car, to check the damage. We had hit and electric fence, and two barbed wire fence and a tree. The car had barely any damage. We were about to back the car out when the back end lifted up. Matt got out and went to check what we were stuck on... Nothing. We drove home.

A few night later we had to prove to our friends that the Courtner stories weren't just talk... They were real. Matt was in the back seat with his friends Trent and Clint, and my friend Jennifer was up front with me. I pulled the car up to the entrance to the house. I shut it off just like Matt did. Our plan was to go in the basement, but when we all got out... Matt didn't. We thought at first that he was scared, but his door wouldn't open. We pulled on the lock with pliers, and tried to pry the door open. It wouldn't budge.

Finally we all decided to get back in the car. We drove a little ways down the road, and I saw Courtner in my review mirror. Jennifer saw him out of her side mirror too. He stood watching us, in the middle of the road... Behind our car. I didn't want to scare Matt. He was already shaken up. A little while later, my seat belt tightened. Now... It didn't just pull... It tightened so hard that my seat got knocked backward. I started to cry, and threw the seatbelt off of me. We couldn't believe it. We finally got back on South road. We went to take Trent, Clint and Matt home. When we got out... We saw from the outside on the back window. ""Matt and Courtney Courtner road""

Ever since that night... If anyone mentions Courtner road... Matt can't see out of his left eye and I get a bloody nose. Every time. Never again will Courtner be viewed as a party place on Halloween. It wants me and my cousin to go back... And never come home.

"My Great Grandfather, the Joker",Australia,Family / Friends Visits,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Family / Friends Visits :: My Great Grandfather, the Joker

I live with my mum, brother, sister, nan and pop in a two story house, before it was my great grandfather's house, he died, we believe that it's him haunting the house because he was a joker.

Heaps of thing happen here, lights on and off, doors shut them selves, we hear things and see things out the corners of our eyes. The washing machine turns off, a fan turned on by it self things, disappear and reappear in places we have looked, mum sometimes wakes up to some one whispering her name urgently like they are trying to wake her up.

One time, me and my mum were home alone and we heard the garage door close and the door leading to either the laundry or the granny flat close, we were thinking my nan was coming home from shopping and no one was there.

My mum had locked the screen door and the wooden door. Went into the kitchen table (which you can see the door from) and started to read the paper. After a while, she looked up and the doors were open, she looked back down then remembered that she locked them so she went to lock them again, but when she looked again it was closed.

One day, mum was having a nap on the lounge. When she heard a bang, she went to look for the source when she looked in my room. In the middle of it was my Navaho doll with my porcelain doll on top, with its head pointing to the wall with the shelf. Which is impossible considering that if that doll fell it would topple forward and land with its head pointing away. The stuff in front of it would fall, the doll would have to fall diagonally to get to that place and the Navaho doll is at the other end

One time I saw a shadow that was walking right in the middle of the walkway following my mum into the kitchen.

Screaming House,"Louisiana, United States",Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: Screaming House

T his story takes place back in 1988. I was 5 years old. My family and I lived in a big white house in Cotton Valley, Louisiana. My sister always told me stories of the house being haunted. I would always run to my mom and get my sister in trouble. My mom had given my sister her own room and I had my own.

After my sister moved out of my room and into hers, it was after everyone had gone to bed one night. I slept in the room right by the kitchen. I started hearing noises coming from the attic which sounded like chains raddling and all of a sudden, I heard a girl scream. I jumped out of my bed and ran to my mom's room and woke her up. She said it was just my imagination and she put me back to bed.

I kept hearing the same sounds for a month. I was so scared that I would sleep with my teddy bear in one arm and a flash light in the other. Then my step sister moved in with us. Me and her shared my room. She said she heard it too. Then it all stopped one day. It was quiet in our house for a couple of months and I was sleeping again.

One night in September, it was around eleven pm, after we all went to bed, aAll of a sudden the whole house was woken up to the sound like someone was in the kitchen breaking every dish in the house and then heard people screaming at each other. My mom turned on the kitchen light and there was nothing happening. All the dishes were in the cabinets and everything was fine.

We heard and saw weird things like that until we moved out in early 1990.

Fallen Farmer,"Louisiana, United States",Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: Fallen Farmer

T his story takes place in 1992, in springhill, louisiana. I was 9 years old. My mom, dad, and I had moved into this cute little house on some beautiful land in the country. The lady who owned the house had told my mom that the old man who lived there before us had walked in the door, one day after working in the yard, and died of a heart attack. She thought nothing of it. I over heard her and my dad talking about it a few months after we moved in. But I gave it no thought. And I knew after I went to bed my mom would come in and cover me up and after that she would shut my door.

Well a few months down the road, I wasn't in a deep sleep so I could hear my door open, and I thought it was my mom checking on me and one night I thought I would open one eye and peek to see my mom. My door opened and there was no one there, but I heard foot steps coming toward my bed and I closed my eye right quick. I felt my blanket covering me up, but there was no one there. And it happened a few times.

One morning before my mom got up to get me up for school, I heard her scream. She said there was an old man standing in front of her closet looking at her. She said he was about 60 and he was wearing a green and black flannel shirt and blue overalls. She called the lady that owned the house and asked ""the old man that died here, do you know what he was wearing when he died?"". She said ""yes, he was wearing a green and black flannel shirt and blue overalls"". My mom freaked out.

No one saw the ghost for a few weeks. It was 3 days after my birthday. I heard my door open again and no one was there and I felt my covers cover me up again. And every night when I went to bed, I would say good night grandpa. And I knew I was safe because I knew he was taking care of me.

Little Girl on my Bed,"Wisconsin, United States",Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: Little Girl on my Bed

I grew up in a very haunted house in Hazel Green, WI. There was a lot of strange things that happened during the 18 years I lived there. The one thing that I remember the most was when I was a sophomore in High School. I was laying on my bed in my bedroom upstairs and had just fallen asleep. All of a sudden I felt my mattress sink a little bit by feet as if somebody sat down on it. I immediately assumed it was my sister trying to steal my cell phone that I had sitting on a shelf at the edge of my bed so I just ignored it and and tried to go back to sleep.

I then woke up about five minutes later because I had felt that weight lift off of my bed as if somebody were standing up. I got up and immediately walked out of my room to confront my sister as I thought she had taken my cell phone. When I opened her bedroom door, she was asleep. I went back into my room and my cell phone was still sitting on the shelf.

I thought it was a little strange but was tired so I laid back down to go back to sleep. I was only lying there for about a minute when I felt the weight at the end of bed again as if somebody had just sat down. I got so scared that I did not even want to move. All of a sudden a little girl's voice said, ""Hey, hey, are you awake?"" I just laid there in horror not knowing if I should move and too afraid to look.

Finally I jumped out of bed and ran all the way downstairs. Although I have never been confronted by that little girl again, one of my friends said they were standing by my door one day and looked out and saw a little girl standing by the tree in my front yard. I don't know what happened or why she is there but I am just glad I moved!

"Harrisons Graveyard in Kinston, Alabama","Alabama, United States",Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: Harrisons Graveyard in Kinston, Alabama

O ne night, my uncle took me, my sister, my brother, my cousin, and my other uncle to an old church graveyard on a long skinny dirt road way back in the woods. There, I witnessed things that I will never forget. I was only 6 or 7 and it was a full moon, you could see everything real good on the dirt road. We arrived at the old church and graveyard between 12 and 1 am. My uncle told us the story that if you touched all 4 corners of Grady Harrison's grave, he would come out and give you his fiddle. My sister and cousin were a lot older than me and a lot braver, they decided to get out of the van and touch the 4 corners of his grave right when they got to the grave, the clouds covered the moon just like in the movies and we heard something calling all of our names.

We started to see orbs pop up and moving in the woods in all kinds of directions, we called for the girls to come back to the van but they didn't hear us, when I looked up I saw Grady Harrison right at them, it was like a white shadow or fog but real detailed, he was playing his fiddle and dancing a jig, finally they saw the ghost and ran back to the van.

But this story isn't over yet, the van wouldn't start, not only that, but at the old church, there was an old walking cane hanging out the window at least 5 eeft and turning all different ways, and the orbs started getting closer, and making strange noises. Finally the van started, it was a brand new van, and we are heading out of the graveyard.

All the kids are in the back of the van made crosses with of close pens, we looked out the window and there is a DEMON, yes I said demon, it had four legs a black body, a black and red face with a fire mane kind of like a lions mane, and fire eyes, it was running right beside the van. I looked right at it, and I felt something that literally made me sick. Once we made it to the paved road, it was gone.

I have seen ghost before, we visited all 13 alabama ghost but I never went looking for them after that. I believe in God but after witnessing what I did on that night, I also believe in the devil and all the bad things he produces.

So if you are ever around Opp, Alabama, just on the other side is Kinston, if you want to believe yourself just go visit Harrison's graveyard on a full moon night but don't say I didn't warn you.

The Ghost of my Dreams,"Utah, United States",Misc,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Misc :: The Ghost of my Dreams

A bout 4 years ago when I was 8, I had an assignment in school to talk about scary things that have happened to us. Well, I had one I would I would never forget. I was getting into bed when I felt this strange chill, even though it always happens to me, for some reason this one was different. I ignored it and I went to sleep.

In my dream I saw this man telling me to wake up, but I really didn't have control over that. Then I woke up, nothing. I went to sleep and the same man was there and said ""wake up..."" By now I was a little creeped out. I woke up again, but this time my little sister was right by me, when I asked her what was wrong, she said she saw a scary man in her dream, so I let her sleep in my room. When I went back to sleep, I saw the man again and he said the same thing, but he added onto it, he said ""I won't leave until you get my message..."" By now I was flipping out, but when I got up the third time, at that moment, I realized what he meant, I need to wake up my sister and hold her hand while we sleep, so she got into bed with me and we held hands while we slept, but before that, she said she kept on seeing the man, scary.

Was he a dead person who had a grudge against me and my sister and came to haunt our dreams, who knows.

Breathless,"Minnesota, United States",Demons / Possessions / Exorcisms,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Demons / Possessions / Exorcisms :: Breathless

W hen I was a freshman in college, I had what is to this day the most terrifying experience of my life. One night I had been up hanging out with friends until around 1:00am, when I decided it was finally time to get ready for bed. I lived in a freshman dorm, with LONG hallways of bedrooms and common/shared bathrooms in the middle of each floor.

I walked into our floor's bathroom and started getting ready for bed, brushing my teeth, washing my face, etc. While I was washing my face, I instantaneously had the wind knocked out of me and struggled to catch my breath. Nothing physically ""hit"" me, but I felt such a tremendously overwhelming feeling of evil behind me that I literally was paralyzed with fear. I couldn't move. For several seconds, I could not breathe.

I remember the pressure in the room changing and my ears literally popping. I knew that some ""thing"" was behind me in that room, and I swear to you, I ""knew"" that if I would have looked into the mirror to see what was behind me, I would probably be institutionalized (it was THAT scary!). I basically sprinted down the hall and into my room once I could move/breathe again, literally hiding under my covers and pillow until I FINALLY fell asleep quite some time later.

Approximatively 6-7 years later, I was talking with another man who graduated from that same college three years after I did. We had a lot in common, and had served as a Teacher's Assistant for the same professor. This man knew a bit about my family's history with ghosts and spirits, and asked me to share some of my stories. When I told him the story of my experience in that residence hall, he was stunned. He told me that the professor we both had worked for had told him years earlier that the campus had been struggling with a demonic presence at the same time I had my experience. He also said that our professor had an identical experience to my own in his office late one evening.

I have NEVER felt pure, POWERFUL evil like that before, nor have I ever felt as scared in my entire life. Part of me wonders what I would have seen had I looked up into the mirror, but I am mostly thankful that I did not.

The Woman in my Closet,"Pennsylvania, United States",Family / Friends Visits,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Family / Friends Visits :: The Woman in my Closet

T his happened when I was 9 years old. My parents and I had moved to this house that summer. The house was an original coal miners house. I guess my parents have lived there when my mother was pregnant with me and they moved when I was 1 1/2 years old.

My room had a closet that had a sliding door on it, but the closet door didn't go all the way to the floor. It was at least two feet from the ground before the door on it started. But that closet door seemed to never shut right. It was always open about an inch or two. My bed sat right across from the closet, so every time I went to bed, I could stare directly at the closet.

One night I woke up for no reason at all that I remember and the closet door was open about six inches to a foot. And there was a woman in the closet staring at me. It freaked me out, so I ended up screaming for my parents and they came running in to see what was the matter. I told them that there was a old woman in my closet staring at me. My dad dismissed it and said I was dreaming but my mom said she would talk to me in the morning about it.

The next morning she asked me what she looked like. I told her it looked like a woman with gray hair, and beady eyes. Then I asked her why she asked. My mom told me that two years before I was born, her and my dad were taking care of my grandmother (my mom's mom). She lost her hair in that house from cancer and then died a year before I was born. My mom told me it was probably her just checking on me.

Now, I think my mom was right about it being my grandmother but I can't sleep with any kind of closet open. I'm half expecting someone to be there.

Farmer's Cart,United Kingdom,Apparitions / Voices / Touches,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Apparitions / Voices / Touches :: Farmer's Cart

T his happened 5 months ago (roundabout). I live in the country. One night I'm driving down a country road (called the Causeway) to my (then) boyfriend's house. My ex boyfriend was driving in front of me (we had taken both our cars to my house) but being a typical guy, he speed off ahead.

I carried on at a reasonable speed when I came up behind this pld fashioned cart being pulled by a horse. Now I drive this road everyday and most nights and I have never seen this cart before. As it was night time, there was also a lantern sat by the driver at the front. I didn't think it ghostly, just strange as I know most of the farmers round our parts and none have a cart they pull by horse or would use a lantern.

There soon came a pullover point which the cart kindly used, so that I could pass. As I drove a bit down the road I looked in the rearview mirror and noticed I couldn't see the cart anymore. I just reasoned that maybe the lantern had gone off and so it was too dark to make out the cart.

It wasn't long when I came up behind my ex boyfriends car. When we got to his house I asked him if he had had a look at the guy driving the cart back on the causeway (so that he could tell me who it had been). He replied that there hadn't been a cart at all on that road. I even described it to him just in case he didn't understand what I meant. But he was adamant there was no cart.

Also the causeway doesn't have any junctions off or on to it. So the cart could not have just pulled on behind his car! I ain't sure whether it was a ghost but I can't explain it otherwise. I don't know of any stories about any farmers that have died but my town has been around for a VERY long time so you never know :)

Being Psychic is a Troublesome Gift,"Kentucky, United States",Psychic / Medium,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Psychic / Medium :: Being Psychic is a Troublesome Gift

S ince I was a little girl I have been seeing and hearing things that most people can not. I am 24 years old now and this hasn't gone away. I awake in the middle of the night only to find things or what used to be people, I guess, staring at me. I see shadows, I never heard any of them talk to me, but I can sometimes on occasion hear weird noises. I can tell people things that no one else would know but them. Am I different? I am starting to wonder if I'm losing it. I would like this gift, as most people would call it, to just go away.

I just bought a house 4 months ago and I'm starting to have dreams or, I guess, nightmares about the basement. I'm seeing dark shadows walk around the house and hearing things drop at night. The house is 47 years old. I can't walk into a hospital without feeling overwhelmed. I feel like things are surrounding me and it's very cold when it happens. I'm starting to feel helpless. What should I do?

My mom says that this is just a gift that God has given me, but I'm not quite sure I want it. I'm never afraid of these things but fear some day I may be. I won't tell anyone about this except my mom. I guess you could say I'm ashamed. I don't want to look like a nut case. I've read all the books and watched all the movies but still can't figure out why. Can I get rid of this or am I stuck with it? Will my children have the same problem? My youngest daughter is two and I've seen her do things that I use to do, like stare very focused on something before she will walk into a room. I have also heard her talking to someone who is not there. And the shadows that I see seem to want to stay in her room more than the rest of the house.

Dolls Looking at Me,"Washington, United States",Poltergeists / Physical Manifestations,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Poltergeists / Physical Manifestations :: Dolls Looking at Me

I went to my friend's house a couple of months ago to stay the night. We thought it would be fun to try and watch movies all night. She didn't have a bed at that time so she took a futon mattress and folded it up in her closet and used that as a bed. Above her tv, about three feet up, she has 3 china dolls on a small shelf. About half way through the movie, I got bored and was looking around the room. I looked up at the three dolls and looked away, I looked back at the doll and it was looking at me... I knew that the first time that I looked at it, the doll was looking a different way. I told my friend about it and she covered the dolls up... I still couldn't go to sleep that night.

The next time I went to stay the night at her house, the same thing happened but the story was a little different. Again we were watching movies. We thought it would be fun to get some of our ""OLD BOYFRIEND"" boxes and burn ALL the stuff that they had given us. So we drove to the burn pile and we started to burn the stuff. We started to get cold and so we went back to the house and started watching movies and stuffing our faces with junk food... You know how girls can get after you do this. We were watching tv and for some odd reason, we both had a feeling that someone or something was watching us. And we both had a feeling that it was the dolls. We looked at the dolls for a sec and the one closest to us turned its head and was staring at us. We were so scared and didn't know what to do except run out of the room.

I have had many scary things happen to me whenever I go to my friend's house and every time it has to do with the dolls.

They Are Everywhere,"Washington, United States",Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: They Are Everywhere

B efore I start my story, I will tell you of the setting of the room. I am 15 years old, and my bed was set up where the bottom end is inside my closet, and I had a blanket over my closet since there was no doors, I was talking on my phone with a friend, and I was facing towards the blanket. After a few minutes, it got really cold and I saw the blanket ripple as if the wind was blowing it, that is not possible since my windows were closed, but as the blanket rippled, I also felt like something was floating over me, and I heard my name being said but in a very quiet raspy voice and it was echoing very softly...

Another time I was home alone, at my computer, and I heard a door slam and the hall light came on and then went back off, and when I got up to go look down the hall no one was there, I was alone, no one could have done it...

I rearranged my room a few days ago, my bed (which is now just a futon mattress) is now inside my closet, my head is in between to walls while the rest of my body is out in the open basically because I no longer have the blanket hanging down, and no doors... And

from the wall on my left I heard a knock. I didn't do anything, then a heard a knock from right, but this time there was two knocks, I started getting a little freaked out, then I heard my name and I told it to please stop cause I was trying to sleep. I felt a lot less scared if I try to be funny... So that's what I did... And it stopped.

[note from the webmaster: the following paragraph seems to be related to this story ]

Another time, me and my friend were sleeping in my room, well we weren't quite asleep, you know how teenage girls are, I'm sure, we were talking about guys and a bunch of other stuff and we both noticed that my doll (I have 3 porcelain dolls on a shelf), the one closest to us turned its head, and now, to this day is still looking toward my bed, it used to look towards my window...

The last story I have to tell you is one time the power was out, the whole house had no power, it was during the day about 7:00 am, I was waiting to leave for school, and the only light was from the sun. We had all the light switches on so if the power came back on we would automatically know... One light flickered on and then off, and it was cold only around that lamp... Which was sitting to my left, then I heard my bedroom door shut lightly and then open and I heard my light switch going on and off, (we have big switches and they have a very noticeable sound) but when I went back there, there was no light on and my door was shut.

One more thing I wanted to add which is not really a story, but there is a shed that we have on the side of our driveway and it always sounds like there is people in it talking and they usually sound very clear, most of the time I can understand them but not always... I have become used to having them around.

Dad's Help,"Pennsylvania, United States",Family / Friends Visits,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Family / Friends Visits :: Dad's Help

S ome of you may have read my first story regarding the events surrounding my father's passing in April of 2006. I had put so much energy and so much of my life into helping my father, along with my mom, get better and get to his appointments, that when he passed I suffered a nervous breakdown.

I went back to work 2 weeks after his passing. I lasted a week back on the job before my emotions and life's pressure took over and I burnt out. At that point I was diagnosed as having a nervous breakdown, which they call something more ""PC"" these days. I spent about a month at home with my Mom just getting things in order and putting life back into perspective. I even went out and got a puppy to help take our minds of things.

These weeks that I spent at home were bitter sweet. I was home for a good portion of the summer but unable to bask in the warm sun as I did when I was younger. Instead I sat and thought and hoped and prayed and just waited to feel ""normal"" once again.

I began having bad dreams, nightmares if you will, and they were the same each time. There would be a different scenario in each dream but the focal point would be, me, trying desperately to save my Dad but, ultimately, being helpless and watching him slowly pass away. Knowing that I had done everything I could for my Dad, this was upsetting and I wished that the dreams/nightmares would subside.

I spoke to my Dad every night and I prayed for a sign that he was proud of me and these dreams were just a subconscious wish that I could have done more.

It was finally time to head back to work. After a few days of being back I realized that my position was way too stressful so I decided to apply for another position inside the company. That night I went home to prepare my resume. I kept it on my little Sony flash drive. As I settled down to freshen up my resume, my flash drive was gone. It was in none of its former homes and I tore the house apart.

I finally gave up and decided to go to bed. I was in the bathroom, brushing my teeth, and I said to my Dad in my mind ""If you aren't busy up there tonight, can you please help me find this thing because I need a new position..."" After brushing my teeth, I went into my room to get my clothes together for the next day and then -BANG- suddenly something hit me and told me to check the pockets of my jeans. Now it was late summer and I had not worn my jeans in at least a month or more. As I debated this in my head I got a cold, yet soothing, chill down my back. I decided to check my jeans. I tried the right pocket and it was empty. Thinking how foolish I was being I tried the left pocket. Guess what was in that pocket? My flash drive. I felt so comforted and freaked out at the same time, I dropped my pants and ran outside to gather myself :)

What an amazing feeling. My Dad was ALWAYS there for me, and I guess he still is.

Funeral Home Ghost,"Texas, United States",Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: Funeral Home Ghost

I n late October, my husband's step grandfather passed away. Earlier that month, I had a baby girl and we went to the old funeral home located downtown of San Antonio, Tx, named M.Rodriguea Funeral Home, where my husband's Grandmother had the services. It was around 4 pm on a Wednesday that we went to pay our respects.

As we walked through the chapel doors, we were greeted by his relatives. They were glad to see my daughter as well. We walked through the aisle to go towards the casket and I just had this weird feeling for some reason. My husband kneeled at the alter, where the casket was, to pray (like we catholics do) and I turned and asked my husband's Grandmother to watch my daughter, and I turned towards my husband, put my left hand on his right shoulder and, next to the casket, there was a wooden pedestal with a picture frame made out of brass and his step grandfather's picture in it.

The picture was facing towards the relatives and when I started praying, the picture rubbed against the wooden stool and turned towards us. My husband looked at me and said, ""Did you see that""? I said, ""Hell yeah I did""! But he told me to be quiet. I turned right away to go to the restroom there and as I entered the restroom with my daughter, in the mirror there was a man standing right behind me with old clothing from the 1800's. I just froze and started praying like we catholics do, and he was gone when I turned to look for him.

As we left the funeral home, right away I told my husband that I do not want to go to that funeral home anymore (even if he had a loved one that passed away).

Why is it Still Happening?,"Florida, United States",Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: Why is it Still Happening?

I just recently wrote a story called What Did My Mother See? , it's about my mother who fell asleep one night in my bedroom and woke up screaming in the middle of the night, and the next morning she told me what had happened. There was a figure walking toward her as though trying to do something to her.

Well this story is similar to what happened to my mother. That one night we all came home from a party that was made by my aunt for my grandmother. After being so exhausted from all that partying, I had to do the dishes or else I wouldn't be able to go to the vacations my family was planning, so I did it. After that, I decided to watch a little bit of t.v. (as always). All of a sudden the t.v. just automatically turned off, when I looked behind the furniture, the cable was disconnected, the scariest part was that everyone else had fallen asleep and my older brother didn't get back home until the morning. If he did disconnect the plug, I would've seen him since the t.v. is in the middle of the living room.

Since the plug being disconnected didn't scare me that much, I just plugged it back in and continued watching t.v. When I went back to sit down on the sofa, I saw someone or something transparent walk through the hallway and go to the bathroom and that was impossible since, in my room, there was a bathroom, so it would've been really stupid to go to the bathroom outside when you have one in your room.

Since that day I barely watch t.v. late at night because I don't want to see that figure again, and I only watch t.v. when someone is there with me watching it or else I won't go.

I just want someone to explain to me what is happening in my house and who will be next to see what my mother, and what I saw?

White Dressed Lady,"Florida, United States",Apparitions / Voices / Touches,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Apparitions / Voices / Touches :: White Dressed Lady

I was staying at my friend Mel's house (her name is really melissa) and we were the only people there. Her parents were divorced and her dad lived in Nevada so it was only her mom living there. But that night her mom was working late and wasn't going to be home until 5 in the morning. We were up in my friend's room when we heard a noise down stairs, we thought her mom came home early. We went downstairs to say hi but her mom's truck wasn't in the driveway. At that point, we thought it was just her cat but when went back up to the room the cat was there, sleeping on the bed. We were really scared now, but we quickly forgot about it.

About an half an hour later, we heard another noise, upstairs, this time. We went in the guest room (where I was going to sleep that night) and we saw the body shape of a lady that was pure white! As soon as we saw her, she was gone. At this point I was crying because I was so scared. We went down stairs and started watching tv when the channels started flipping by themselves. I started crying again. My friend decided it was best if we went up stairs and went to bed. So we were going up stairs and my friend looked back and saw the lady's face outside the window and she screamed. I looked back for a second and looked back to the top of the stairs and saw the lady and pointed to the front door. Me and my friend, practically peeing our pants, ran to my friend Kelesy's house, who was next door, and we told her all about it.

The next day we went back and told my friend's mom what had happened and she told us that a woman had dropped dead in that house! I never went there at night again.

The Shadow in the Cornfield,United Kingdom,Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: The Shadow in the Cornfield

I was about 9 at the time, and I was just being slowly allowed to go where I wanted in my small village. Me and my friends spent our summer holidays going to new places that it seemed no one had been to, it seemed adventurous but of course, we were only going about 4 miles away from home to where farmers would regularly throw us off their land and threaten us with the police (they never did do anything, even if we were caught again and again). We would also take my gold hearted husky (wolfie), he was our bodyguard I suppose.

We were wondering around the outskirts of the village looking for somewhere to go, we had pretty much been everywhere, when we came across this path, it wasn't like this path that appeared like magic and we had never seen it before, we had seen it every time we had set off for a walk, but it just looked boring, it was just an old road with a few bushes and a house about a quarter of the way down.

To be honest it was painfully boring, there was a field full of junk, we had fun in for about half an hour. After about 2 hours, we came across this cornfield, it was such a relief, it was great, the corn was taller than our heads and had a warm comforting glow about it. We decided to have a game of hide and seek which I suggested because I could cheat by using the dog. After about 4 games, I was the seeker and I was traveling through the vast amounts of corn, using wolfie to track them down. He would sniff his way there and bark once we were there.

He was pulling me towards the prize, when he froze and began to whimper, I had never seen him like this. He was running behind me and barking and crying, it scared the hell out of me. Suddenly it went freezing cold, the temperature was about 20 degrees and there I was, shivering like a leaf. A black figure swooped past me in the next row of corn, wolfie pulled with all his might in the other direction yanking me to the floor. He pulled free of his collar and ran off.

I laid dazed on the floor, oblivious of what had just happened, when I heard Clarke (one of the 3 friends I had with me that day, also my best friend) scream. I shot up and followed the noise, when I got there, he was on the floor shaking, rocking backwards and forwards like a mad man, I didn't dare approach him, he was freaking me out. At this time, he still hadn't noticed I was there until I shouted for angus and chelsea, he turned around and shouted to me to stay away and picked up a rock and threw it at me, cutting my head open. More than anything I was shocked it didn't hurt but I guess that was the shock, I just turned around and ran, I don't know what I was thinking, about halfway through, I saw angus and chelsea holding wolfie, put wolfies collar and lead back on, told angus and chelsea to run and set off running again.

Usually I was the slowest runner of my friends but I was miles in front of them, I ran for about an hour when I finally got out of the long path, I collapsed on the pavement out of breath with wolfie nuzzling his head into me, also panting desperately. Chelsea and Angus shortly followed, without Clarke, we sat on the pavement for 2 hours waiting for clarke, by this time my face was a crusty red scab with red hand smears, then we saw a staggering figure stumble out onto the road. It was clarke, his face was torn to shreds as were his clothes, I ran towards him, yet again he shouted at me to stay away, so chelsea asked what was wrong, he answered to her. He told her that a man in the field had told him that I would be the cause of a death of someone close to him, and that a woman dressed in rags had attacked him.

We never spoke to Clarke after that, he became just another face, but his mum and my mum were friend and they would regularly meet up at my house, and this one time when clarke's mum was at my house, I was outside messing about on my bike, she was just getting in her car to go home when a car flew round the corner and sped towards me. She ran up, pushed me out the way but sadly she was hit and died 2 days later in intensive care.

2 years later at school, I was in toilets throwing up when clarke burst in and grabbed me by my hair, dragged me across the floor and banged my head on the floor several times, shouting he said it would happen. Angus burst in and grabbed him off me and restrained him while I picked myself of the floor, I ran and got help.

After that we never saw him again, he moved away the next day, that's why he had done it that day. The last I heard of him he had moved to Texas and tried to kill himself, but failed. To this day I miss Clarke and I will never go in that evil field ever again.

The Creepy Empty Room,"Florida, United States",Misc,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Misc :: The Creepy Empty Room

T his story has to do with a creepy empty room next to my room. My room used to be a dining room and was attached to that creepy room, both rooms were empty for a while, then I took the dining room as my bedroom to escape from my sloppy little sister. My mom had french doors put up to separate the rooms. Later I got a bed, computer, and many stuffed animals in my room and that room got a television and couch. One day I was watching the movie Twister in that room and was reading a book, too, I fell asleep because books put me to sleep, then I woke up to the television off and the movie and book was gone, I found them in their original spots before I took them, so that made me confused.

Later that room became empty again and it was summer and got very warm in my room, that room is always cold so I opened the french doors to cool down my room, then something weird happened, I suddenly fell into a deep sleep and I would hear my name being whispered into my ear and wake up feeling wide awake and terrified with my heart pounding and a strange feeling in my chest, that kept happening until I closed the french doors, I don't really know why that happened when the doors were open.

Sometimes when I have my dog, Peanut, sleeping in my room with me, I would see her looking into that room and looked like she was watching something moving around in there, but when I looked I didn't see anything. Sometimes I would go in that room to put some stuff in there just to move them out of the way, like christmas decorations and donation stuff, and every time I go in that room it's freezing cold and creepily silent. Rarely, my little sister and I would hear a thud in there and find nothing there. My sister told me when she fell asleep in my room with those doors open, she would experience the same thing that happens to me when those doors are open.

When I went in there to move some empty boxes in there, I would hear the glass from the window cracking and would hear loud wind and wind chimes, which was what it sounded like when I was in that room when we were going through a hurricane and a tornado was coming, it's like repeating that same sound for some reason, I don't really know why that happens, my rat was also killed by my dog in that room. I think that room is probably creepy because of my worst memories take place there, but I don't know the exact reason.

Knocking on the Walls,"Washington, United States",Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: Knocking on the Walls

M e and my little sister share a room, I'm 15 and she is 13. I sleep close to the closet. I had a friend stay the night one night and my sister went to a friend's house. Me and my friend have both had really weird experiences with the paranormal and have had many encounters with the paranormal as well. We were watching tv and we heard knocking in the other room but we didn't think much of it.

After about three hours of watching movies we got really tired and so we went to my room and we tried to go to sleep and then, we were almost asleep and it sounded like there was someone walking around in the room that we were in! Our house is BRAND NEW... No one has ever lived in it... So you would think that there wouldn't be any paranormal activity or any entities in there. And the noises sounded like someone was walking around us in a circle and the floor would make really little squeaks and so we got scared and so we got on my bed... Then we started to hear knocks on my closet door... KNOCK, KNOCK, KNOCK! And it sounded like someone was in the closet, knocking on the wall facing my little sisters room...  It kept going on for about five minute and it happened every 2-3min.

Then finally I was brave enough to get up and go to the closet... I opened it up and there was nothing in it and I couldn't see any orbs. I went to turn on my little night light and went back to bed. It started to happen again, after about an hour or two and then we just went out in the living room and went to sleep there.

This story is very scary to me, I don't know if it will be as scary for you but anyway... If you have ever had this happen to you then please leave a comment and if you did do anything to make it stop please tell me.

The Haunted Farm House,"Idaho, United States",Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: The Haunted Farm House

I n 1982, I was doing some carpentry work for a farmer in Elk Point, SD, on a house that had been moved from town to his farm about 6 miles from town. Almost as soon as I started on it, I noticed things occurring that I could not explain. I would be working in a room and go to get some materials and the lights would be off when I returned and lights would be on in rooms where I had not been. I worked there for several days and these things kept going on.

On the fourth day, I was working in the kitchen, putting up paneling and I had a ladder sitting in the middle of the room with a box of panel nails sitting on the paint shelf of the ladder. Suddenly, the ladder started sliding across the floor and it tipped over spilling the nails all over the floor. I could smell Jasmine Perfume real strong, the room had gotten very cold and it was 90 degrees outside. I had not felt the house shaking nor were there any trucks going by. I picked up the ladder and got down on my hands and knees to pick up the nails and out of the corner of my eye, I saw a shadow moving from the bathroom in to the bedroom. Then I heard the stairs squeak and I got up and went to the stairs to the upstairs bedrooms. I could not see any one so I went up the stairs and looked through the bedrooms but I could find no one up there.

I went back down stairs and finished picking up the nails. A few minutes later the farmer came in to see how I was doing. I told him about the strange things that had been going on and he started laughing. He said, ""You just met our ghost,"" and then he told me a story about the house and why it was moved. He said the house was originally in town and the old woman that lived in the house had killed herself by hanging in the basement. He took me to the basement and showed me the beam that she hung herself from and where the neighbors found her. No one had been able to live in the house since she had died, as they could not handle the pranks she would pull on them.

We went back up stairs and he told me that she had never been violent, just that she liked to turn lights on and off and move things around. He told me to talk to her and she would leave me alone. Then he told me that when they moved the house they thought the ghost would stay in town but she did not and now he was stuck with her. As he left, he said that she would not harm me but she would continue moving things around and turning the lights off and on. I continued to work on the house and a few days later, I finished the kitchen. I saw her shadow in the bedroom looking towards me and I said, ""I hope you enjoy your new kitchen..."" I was there for almost a week after that and I did not have any more problems with the lights or anything else.

When the job was done and I had moved on to other work, I talked to the farmer several times and he told me that the old lady was not bothering the people that were currently living in the house. He had no explanation as to why. Believe me, this scared the heck out of me and I hoped I would never have this type of experience again, but I have, as you can see by the other stories I have written.

The School That Was Built on a Cemetary,Canada,Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: The School That Was Built on a Cemetary

I 'm kind of new to to this site and this will be the first one I'll post, I have a lot more though. This one isn't the scariest but it's still one that I'll remember clearly when I think of 'ghosts'. It happened about 5 years ago. I was 9 years old then and I still can remember this very clearly. I moved a lot of places and went to a lot of different schools, but this one... Was just different from the others somehow. I had heard rumors from some people that it was built on a cemetery and that it was haunted. So when I heard that, I had chills down my spine but I didn't quite believe it. I told that to my parents and they said that it was nonsense and that I had no reason to worry about it. So I slept through it and forgot about it.

Then the next day, I went to my new school for the first time. Everything was fine and everyone seemed nice. Also, the school was kind of small so they didn't have enough space for all the classrooms inside it and some were outside. I don't know how to call them but anyways... I was in one of the outdoor ones, I felt reassured. Although when it came to going inside the school for Music class, the bathroom and stuff like that I had this feeling that something there just wasn't right. So I tried not going inside too often. I never actually went in it alone, only with classmates and teachers.

Well, one day we were inside our classroom doing some work and I didn't go to the bathroom for a while, I was holding it in and I really had to go so I gave in and asked my teacher if I could. Of course, she said yes. I ran off to the school's front door (the classrooms are in front of the school in rows). I pulled the door open and walked to the bathroom, not looking behind me. I had that strong feeling of being watched. I was so scared. I then came up in front of the bathroom and opened it. The feeling was even stronger now and the bathroom was icing cold. I just ignored it. At least, I tried to. I just went into a stall when I heard the door open. Of course, I thought it was somebody else that entered the washroom, so I didn't pay attention. I then heard some footsteps, they were unusual though. Not the kind an actual person would make. I started to shake and the feeling of being watched just grew stronger and stronger. Then, I heard someone pulling some tissue paper. I still told myself it was nothing, it was probably just someone else.

When I was about to come out of the stall, I was still hearing footsteps. I came out and everything grew silent. No more noises at all. It's as if the thing that was there just vanished suddenly. I got so scared and opened the door slamming it to the wall to get out. I was about to run off when I just froze there. Some white flash mixed with some colors passed by me so fast that I couldn't notice what it was. It was just so fast and so sudden. It gave me a huge chill, I was freezing. When I could actually move, I ran off and pushed the school's front doors open. I think that was the fastest I'd ever ran my whole life. I came back to the classroom trying to take my breath back and everyone just stared at me with a surprised look on their face. I sat there as if nothing had happened.

Then things kept happening when I was in that school, I tried not to go inside but sometimes I had to. Like to go to the library to go get a book for my book report. So that day, I went and I stared inside the library looking at the bookshelves searching and when my classmates were in another area of the library. I was in between two bookshelves alone when I see someone on the other side of the bookshelf. I thought it was another student. But then I went to the other side only to see that the 'person' had disappeared. It was a girl with shoulder length brown hair, she looked like she was in her teens. I was so scared, stuff still kept happening. This time, smaller things. Like footsteps, unusual noises and etc... But other than that, nothing too scary as I'd experienced before.

I moved from that place since then. I thanked god. I didn't want to be in that school any longer. Just after that, my friend had told me that someone killed a girl in the bathroom I used. I never ever want to go back there again. Those troubled spirits probably never rested in peace. People just ignored the fact that they were there but everyone knew they were. I have no idea what had become of that school after moving. I feel so relieved that I didn't have to spend another minute there. I didn't actually tell anyone what I'm telling you right now but I feel as if if I ever told anyone, they would just think I was crazy.

Well, that's it. Sorry for making it so long... It might have not sounded that scary but trust me, it was!

Also, I'm not good at writing stories but I still hope you had fun reading this and I'm just wondering, does anyone know what that weird white flash might have been? Do you think it was an evil or a good ghost? Maybe it was the girl...

Spiritualist,New Zealand,Psychic / Medium,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Psychic / Medium :: Spiritualist

I am different from most people who see ghosts. I see them everyday of the week, every month of the year and so on. You may think this is a bit odd and that I should go and speak to a psychiatrist, but I have. She says it is a perfectly normal thing for me considering the fact that my mum and my grandma and her mum and so on see ghosts as well.

It all started when I was about seven. I started to hear thing and see things float around my house. I didn't really think this was that odd but now I do. Last year my grandma died. I saw her ghost about twice in one night. That's when I started to see my first ghosts. I've seen it all. Cats, mice, people. I know the names of three different ghosts living in my house and before I see the ones that stay, I dream about them and why they died. It disturbs me. A lot of people say that it would be really cool to see a ghost but I know that they're wrong. It's absolutely horrible with terrible consequences. I haven't been able to sleep properly since I was 9 and I've been in hospital with terrible headaches which I still have.

I hate to be a party pooper but generally seeing ghosts is not a horror story and unless you want to, don't believe them. I don't have any proof that this story is true but if you don't believe me, so be it. I know what's what.

The Ghosts of the Balkans,"Macedonia, the Former Yugoslav Republic of",Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: The Ghosts of the Balkans

M y parents are from a village called Capari in Macedonia. I was born in the States but on occasion I visit the motherland, usually staying in the village of Capari. I have heard a million superstitions, ghost stories, etc, from my folks and others in Capari. It's not that I don't believe in these occurrences, it's just that I never witnessed them for myself.

In the summer of 1995, while on a two month vacation in Capari, I saw and I now believe. My grandma has a stable of horses in the barn, next to her house. One morning, the horses were dripping wet, sweating like Patrick Ewing in a overtime game, and the manes on all three of the horses were braided into hundreds of braids. It would have taken years to do the braiding, yet it happened overnight.

When I asked what had happened, my grandmother and mother responded, as if it weren't that big of a deal, ""the beli ubai are out."" Apparently, the beli ubai are lady ghosts whom died over a hundred years ago, trampled by horses that the Ottoman Empire Soldiers were riding.

A few nights later, I was walking home from a Pub (keep in mind, Macedonian villages do not have street lights and it is pitch dark at night - scary enough). I heard a woman whispering in my ear. I quickly turned around and saw a woman (she appeared illuminated) run away quicker than Carl Lewis. I was freaked out and sprinted the rest of the way home. When I told my grandma what had happened, she told me only horses have to be scared, they have never harmed humans. Whatever? Also, if I was to get scared, before leaving to go outdoors at night I had to chant, beli ubai, beli ubai, beli ubai. This, as I was told, would keep me from seeing them. Beli Ubai translates to White Nice in English, however, it makes no sense.

There are so many other ghosts in that village and so many stories to tell. I do not know if this is interesting reading for anyone of you, I just wanted to share one of my stories. If you want to hear more, just comment, it was a weird summer.

Usually, only a few people might see an individual ghost. Yet almost the whole village of Capari is able to see the ghosts that I am talking about. I wonder if it's because no one is scared of them and nobody pays them to much attention. People there don't even talk about it, as if it isn't unusual?

Please Help Me Understand,Australia,Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: Please Help Me Understand

I am hoping someone might be able to help me/us understand what we are experiencing as I think we are getting a little nervous about the situation. I have one sister only, who has 4 children and her eldest is 23 years old. On a few late nights I would visit their house after visiting mum in hospital. When I was sitting in the lounge room, I caught a glimpse of a smallish dark shadow (very quick). When I turned my head my sis asked what was the matter and I said I thought I saw something. When I described it, she then explained about their experiences, which we now are more conscious about and I think we are scaring ourselves.

To give you examples, they have been in all different areas of the house, seems to be small size as on one occasion my sisters partner thought it was one of the kids hiding under his bed. He called out, ""what are you doing?"" On separate occasions my sis has felt a presence of something and seems to be weighing her down in bed and then woke up face to face with a very old, scary looking woman very close to her face. My niece (without any knowledge of her mum's experience) had a similar experience, she sleeps downstairs on her own and felt pressure on her chest and this old woman staring at her.

Now on the same night that I caught a glimpse of this shadow, when I was ready to leave the house, I reached for the door handle and found that it jiggled. I was a little hesitant at first but eventually grabbed it and walked out the door. On another night again, when I was going to leave her house, I heard a knocking on the door (it sounded like a noise from a door softly banging in the breeze, as my kids tend to leave the bathroom door open and it sounded identical). It didn't stop until I opened the door and found no one there as well as a very still night, no breeze. I thought how weird. Now, two nights ago my niece stayed the night to look after my son as I would be working the following morning and all was well, until she told me the following morning her experiences in my house. She feels strange in my eldest son's room (7 years old) and has seen more than one dark shadow standing in front of her while she was laying on my sofa bed. I don't know what this all means but I REALLY am curious to read all suggestions.

When my eldest son was a baby I know that he would look up and have a great giggle. When I would try and look for whatever it was, nothing, eventually I put it down to his angels are watching over him and as long as he was happy, all was well. Now that his little brother has moved into that room after he was born, I am finding that he too some nights is having giggling fits and I just say at least he is being looked after.

Sister: purchased approx 20+yr old double stories house. Found out from neighbors that they had a young son who suffered a battle with cancer and he passed away in the house.

My house: Built from scratch, we are the only owners. The area was farm land, cows grazing on the pastures.

Hope you can shed some light, to help us understand what exactly is going on, what we should do etc.

The Radio Turns On by Itself!,"New York, United States",Family / Friends Visits,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Family / Friends Visits :: The Radio Turns On by Itself!

F irst things first, I entered a story back in March called "" My Haunted Home "", but it was before I got a username on the web site, under the name of Ally, if you would like to check it out. I said in it that I had more ghost stories to tell about my home, because I think that it may be haunted by my great-grandma. I think that's because she died when I was a year old, and my baby picture was put into her casket on her funeral. I have three pieces of her furniture in my bedroom.

Here's one of my many (and more to come!) stories! I have an alarm clock radio near my bed. One night, my friend slept over my house and we were just sitting around talking. It was a little late, only 11:30-ish, and all of a sudden my alarm clock radio turned on! We just looked at each other, thinking something like, ""What?"" and I got up and walked over to my radio to turn it off. It has an alarm function that will make the radio turn on instead of a chime. But the alarm was off. It has a sleep function, too, but it's only activated by pressing a button. It happened a few times after that, once with the same friend over, around nine o'clock-ish, once with another friend, in broad daylight, and another time, one afternoon, I was home alone in my room, and once again, the radio turned on, no alarm, no sleep function, nothing. I threw down my book and said, ""OK, that's enough! Please stop it!""

Dead Pilot?,"Virginia, United States",Apparitions / Voices / Touches,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Apparitions / Voices / Touches :: Dead Pilot?

I was a long haul trucker for many years. In December of 2004, I had a delivery in Winchester, Virginia and a second stop in Washington, D.C. At my first stop I was delayed and didn't get unloaded until after 2:00 AM. I left Winchester heading east on Highway 7. Around 2:30 I came to the intersection of Highway & and Route 601 near Bluemont. At a gas station, I pulled in to check my map of Washington in anticipation of my delivery. The station was closed at that hour. There was virtually no traffic going by and it was a cold, moonless night. While I was sitting there, someone knocked on my door, startling me. I jumped and turned off my interior light so I could see outside and rolled down my window.

A man was standing there in an airline flight crew uniform. He had four stripes on his shoulder epaulets indicating a Captain. He was without a jacket on a very cold morning. He climbed up on the step of my cab. He smelled like he had bathed in kerosene. When he got close to my face, I could see that his cap had the TWA insignia on it.

""Could you give me a lift?"" he asked in a voice that seemed raspy. I assumed it was from the cold. I was really taken off guard. It was odd. I was in a dark, rural area on a freezing night being asked by an airline pilot wearing short sleeves for a ride. I asked him where he was headed.

""I work for TWA. I gotta get to Dulles to work a flight, please give me a ride, I'll pay you,"" he responded.

""Well, how about I give you a ride to the next open store where you can call a cab?"" I offered.

""Okay, thank you, thank you,"" he mumbled. ""He said that we could descend...""

I didn't know what he was talking about but I didn't want the guy to freeze out there. ""Go around and get in,"" I instructed.

He climbed down and shuffled around the front of the truck. When he passed the first light, I was struck by the fact that he seemed to have long sideburns, a la Elvis. When he continued on to the right, he totally vanished. I don't mean faded away; he just ceased to exist.

I jumped down out of the truck and looked all around with a flashlight, even under the truck. He was just disappeared. As I continued on toward Washington, I remembered something odd. TWA had gone out of business over two years ago. What was going on, I wondered, totally perplexed and shaken by the experience.

When I got home, I did some online research. What I found has totally turned my beliefs upside down. I've always thought that ghost stories were hokum, but with what I learned, I'm no longer sure.

It turns out that on December 1, 1974 a TWA Boeing 727, Flight 514, descended prematurely through a low cloud deck and slammed into a rocky outcropping on Mount Weather,VA. The aircraft disintegrated with all 92 people on board killed. The flight had originated in Columbus, Ohio and was supposed to land at Washington National Airport. It was diverted to Washington's other airport, Dulles International, because high winds had closed National. According to cockpit voice and flight data recordings, the crew mistakenly believed that air traffic controllers had cleared them to descend to 1800 feet from their previous altitude fix of 7000 feet. This error, combined with strong downdrafts, caused the aircraft to hit the mountain at 1670 feet above sea level. At the last second they broke out of the overcast only to see the rocky and snow covered mountain looming in their windscreen. The captain's last words to his co-pilot were, ""Get some power on!"" just moments before the recording abruptly ceased.

The place of impact was less than a mile south of where I encountered whoever, or whatever, it was that I saw almost exactly thirty years later. I don't want to definitely say it was an ghost but the fact remains that there was someone who appeared to be an airline pilot with a very dated hairstyle wearing a uniform of a defunct business.

I no longer am a trucker, but this has troubled me for over two years. If anyone would have any insight into this, I'd appreciate your help. Thank you.

Something Grabbed my Feet,"Missouri, United States",Poltergeists / Physical Manifestations,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Poltergeists / Physical Manifestations :: Something Grabbed my Feet

W hen I was about 14, my friend Kayleigh and I were staying at our friend Kiley's house out in the country. There was an old house near that we wanted to go explore. It was night time, my friend Kayleigh was too scared to go and stayed at the house. Kiley and I got a flashlight and walked out, it was a long walk to get there. It was dark so we couldn't see a lot with our one flashlight, but it was a very run down house and there were toys all over the yard.

There was a beat up car and a shed. We tried the door to the house and we decided to go inside. The first room was a kitchen, and to the right was a stairway. The walls of the kitchen had holes in them and reddish/brown splatterings of things on the wall. We weren't sure what it was, but it was on the refrigerator too. We opened it up and found the same reddish/brown stuff inside. We got kind of freaked out and went outside again. We heard something and we took off running back to her house.

When we got there we told our friend Kayleigh about it and decided to go back the next day while it was light and check out the upstairs. We decided to go to sleep and my friends Kiley and Kayleigh took the twin bed, and I was lying on the floor. I had been trying to sleep for a little bit, with my back turned to my friends. Suddenly I felt my blanket by my feet moving. I sat up because I thought it was Kiley's cat, but the cat wasn't in the room.

So I asked my friends if they messed with my blanket and they said no and laughed at me. I didn't believe them, so I laid on my back this time and kept my eyes open so I could try to catch them. Suddenly the blanket was yanked down on my foot strongly, my toes were forced to the ground. I screamed and got up onto the bed with them and turned the lights on. There was no way they did it because I had been watching them. They didn't believe me, so I ended up just sitting on the bed with the the lights on and staying up all night while they slept. I was so mad that they didn't believe me!

The next day, when we went back to the house, we saw a large circle of stones around a large mound of dirt with a cross sitting on top of it. There was a tire swing that moved back and forth, though there was no wind and even the leaves weren't moving. We went back into the house to show Kayleigh the reddish/brown splatters, but she wasn't convinced of anything. We were too scared to go upstairs, so we came back outside and I stepped off the porch onto what I thought was another broken step. When I looked down it was a headstone. Why there was a headstone laying by a porch, I have no idea. When Kayleigh saw that she started to believe. Kiley and I went into the shed and there were really weird drawings and markings all over the walls that were glow in the dark. I started getting really scared, and started running back to the house, my friends were close behind me.

I'm just wondering if maybe something followed Kiley and I back the first night and was messing with my foot. I know it happened, I wasn't dreaming, no one else could have done it, and I was terrified. My friends still don't believe me to this day. Has something ever happened to any of you, and no one believed you?

Little Boy Outside my Door,"Missouri, United States",Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: Little Boy Outside my Door

W hen I was about 12 or 13, I was sleeping in my room and my mom came and woke me up for school. It was winter so it was pitch black outside and dark in my room, but the hallway light is always on. My mom opened my door about a foot and told me to wake up, but in those light conditions, she just looked like a black shadow. So I sat up and said ok, and she moved away from the doorway, leaving it open. Behind her was the shadowed outline of a little boy and at the time, I had a nephew about that height and size, so I figured he was at our house for some reason. I laid back down and a few minutes later, I went to get up and the little boy shadow was gone, so I figured he had gone downstairs. I got up and went downstairs and it was just my mom. I asked her why my nephew was there, and she looked at me funny and said ""why would he be here"". And I said ""you mean he ISN'T here?"", and she said yes, it was just her. I didn't tell my mom what happened because she wouldn't have believed me. And I never saw the little boy again.

But our house is haunted, so I wasn't too worried about the little boy. Lots of things happen at our house, mainly having to do with the upstairs and our stairway. The house is about 100 years old, so I kind of think maybe something happened on the stairway. Directly under the upstairs stairway is our downstairs stairway which leads to the basement. For months I had a recurring dream about being chased by something and hiding under the basement stairs. When I would get under the stairs I would wake up. My friend thought that maybe my dream was trying to tell me something, and there was something under the stairs. I haven't gone under them since she said that because I'm afraid I will find something.

Possession,South Africa,Demons / Possessions / Exorcisms,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Demons / Possessions / Exorcisms :: Possession

M y name is Andrea and I want to share with you briefly my experience of demon possession. I had a demon follow me for most of my life. I of course was not aware of this at the time but after I was released from the demon about two years ago, I actually was able to do a very fascinating thing. I was able to communicate with the demon and hear from him when he started following me and influencing my life. This was done simply put after the demon had released himself from his application through forgiveness and is now just another being working in the dimensions (heaven) to assist us here on earth. More can be read about the transformation of heaven and the release of the demons through forgiveness at desteni-universe.co.za .

It started soon after my father died at the age of eleven, when all aspects of my life and 'personality' started changing drastically. The demon used my father's death to turn my thoughts against 'God' and created a relationship (unknowing to me) to the stark reality that a lot of children face when they experience such a loss. From that point on, I questioned religion, God and the meaning of why we even bother being here when we're going to die lonely, miserable deaths.

A couple of weeks after my father's death, his closest friend and wife came to give my mother their condolences. That evening after everyone had gone to bed, I sat in the lounge chatting to my father's friend. Next thing the demon integrated into this man and he out of the blue started fondling me. You can imagine my shock. This event of course spiraled me even further into a darker side of my personality as it was clear to me that not only can God not be trusted but neither can people. So the demon was preparing me to distance myself from God and all of life by showing me the 'evil' side of God's people. That indeed people who were supposedly from God's creation were nothing but evil, supposedly dressed as Christians. So my dislike for religion (especially Christianity) increased ten fold.

As the years went by, I went into a quieter, emotionally unstable personality. During my high school years I found myself becoming distant from the other children and seeking different values to theirs. Things that they considered precision I laughed at like boys, religion and education. This of course had a lot to do with how the demon was influencing my thought processes and my beliefs. I saw things clearly from the perspective of religion and how people are slaves. I understood many things which when discussed with other children, caused them to label me as 'weird'. I asked them (which the demon admitted he did through me) why do they go to church when people die horrible deaths all in the name of God. Now as you can see that is quite something coming out of the mouth of a 17 year old?

When I finished school I was very much anti religion already, yet I found paganism quite an interesting concept. I met somebody who was a Wiccan and together we delved into the art of magic and speaking to the dead (Ouija board). This became my life, a devotion to God's, Goddesses and creating spells to punish people that did us wrong. The funny part of it was that the demon told me he was the only being that I had ever spoken to on the Ouija board, due his ability to block all other beings. You see this demon was no ordinary demon, he was quite powerful and his 'mission' was simply to create a world for me in which my focus was always on him. He had the ability to control my actions to such a degree that all decisions that I made were under his control. Any job that I took would fail and I would be unemployed again, sitting with my friend, playing Ouija board. When I did finally find a two years job it was on a secluded farm where my main focus was just to work, with very little interaction with people.

After two years I met a guy and moved in with him. This of course was not so much to the liking of the demon as he saw me as his possession, so he decided it might be a good idea to control our relationship as well. The relationship became abusive to the point that I was constantly under verbal attack and sometimes physical. The demon would integrate into him and start accusing me of seeing other men, and then the next moment he was fine again. Sometimes he would become violent, picking me up by my neck, throwing me up against a wall and then minutes later he wouldn't remember what he did. This strange behavior went on for about three years and finally I allowed the demon to possess me just to get away from the pain and fear.

The demon openly admitted to me that he was jealous and that the 'other' man was only there to pay the bills. You see by this stage, I had started having a relationship with this demon. He presented himself to me as a God and I believed that he was going to take care of me in this world. We shared an understanding about this world and had decided to walk this world together. It was however not easy for him to watch the other man having to provide for me as he did not want him in my life.

So day after day he would ensure that I hated this man by created the abuse and also ensuring that he was the one that I loved. Strange to hear a person talk about loving a spirit, I know, but if you can imagine you and I walking and talking without physical bodies and yet I was able to see and hear him. I had a serious contempt for humans and related completely to this demon's experience of himself. However once things became too much in the relationship with my ex, I decided to leave and it was the effect of having a possessive ex-boyfriend and a possessive demon that I finally allowed myself to be fully possessed. This was very gradual but by the time my ex decided to do something and take me for an exorcism, I was sitting on my bed day in and day out possessed by this demon. When my ex would visit, I would sit there naked speaking as the demon (in a man's voice), I had fully given up and was allowing this demon to speak for me.

Luckily for me my ex realized something was wrong and convinced me to go for an exorcism. This of course was very entertaining to the demon as exorcisms are not very successful (the demon just moves on to another body). However at the time it assisted me and I 'released' myself from the demon. It was not an easy process as the reason for me becoming possessed in the first place (depression, loneliness and the inability to relate to humans) was still with me.

Therefore about six months after this I yet again communicated with the demon, as I one day realized he was still with me, yet keeping his distance. I again allowed for him to step back into my life and it was quite a story to not allow myself to get killed by this demon. Occasionally, if I was not careful around him, he would pressurizing me into committing suicide and once it was a close call.

The experiences that I had with this demon were rather fascinating and now that I have the ability to talk to him he explains to us (we work with demons that have been released as I have mentioned) how demons use to work and why. So if any of you have had similar experiences and require assistance, please feel free to speak to me. If you are not sure if you have been demon possessed but you suspect so I can speak to the demons (if any) and find out.

Often people don't realize they have had demon involvement in their life as they don't even realize the extent of demon possession. I am not religious, I work however with all beings in heaven (we speak to them through an interdimensional channel). I speak to the dimensional beings in 'heaven' as it is now (a lot of changes have taken place) as they are now working with us to assist man kind.

The Blue Eyes Lady,Mauritius,Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: The Blue Eyes Lady

I t was my winter break from school, when I stuck on the unsolved mysteries of this lady whom I had met in a hotel in Mauritius. My parents and me along with my brother had stayed in the hotel for about 4 days.

Once, when my parents and my brother had gone out to the beach which was a little far but in front of the hotel. I was writing a letter to my best friend when suddenly I heard a loud spooky music from the room next to mine. I was disturbed and so went to the next room. I then knocked on the door, an old lady walked out who had many wrinkles and deep dark circles on her face and had scary BLUE EYES and looked weird! Thinking that she was a normal and a very old lady, I asked her to kindly slow down the volume of the music which was disturbing me. She then replied with a weird voice, ""OK"". I went back and continued with my letter but a little after the same music disturbed me which was even louder this time. I got very angry and went to the lady again, she then replied the same and quietly went inside. I then again went back, but this time when the music was so loud that one could not bear it. I had to again go to that BLUE EYES lady's door, but this time she did not open the door. I peeped inside the keyhole of the door, I saw everything BLUE! (the lady was also peeping from the keyhole).

I was very scared and ran up to the reception and told the man present there about what had happened. The man replied, ""An old lady with blue eyes did used to live here but she had died about 3 years ago"".

This mystery of that blue eyes lady is still unsolved in my mind. What would have actually happened... Was she a ghost?

Visit Me,"Texas, United States",Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: Visit Me

W hen I was little, my mom would tell me stories about a little girl who died of a ship crash. I would get scared because that girl lives in my house. Sometimes you could see a shadow in the mirror in the hallway. She said her name was Elizabeth and she said she was on a ship to the gold rush. She also at the time wrote something that said ""visit me"". She would freak me out. One time, she played with a pillow and hit me in the head. My mom was scared so she called a priest. Once he got there, he said a lot of weird things and I could hear Elizabeth screaming. I cried because she was my best friend, but my mom said ""she'll be happy now"" but I still see her in my dreams. She came back and said Jesus is proud of me. I had a cheerful expression on my face and I asked her ""will you tell my dad I love him because he died?"" and she said ""ok"", we hugged and I cried tears of joy!

My Spooky Graduation Trip,"North Carolina, United States",Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: My Spooky Graduation Trip

I 've always been fascinated with ghosts and the supernatural, so for my high-school graduation gift, my grandmother arranged for the two of us to stay at a supposedly haunted bed-and-breakfast, just outside of Asheville, North Carolina. The B&B was in a beautiful, completely renovated Victorian house that had been owned by a doctor when it was first built. The owners actually showed us some bloodstains on the floor in a small room in the back of the house -they told us this had been the doctor's operating room, and that they'd tried everything to get the stains out but hadn't had any luck. I asked them if they'd had any ghostly experiences recently and they said no.

The next morning my grandma and I went down to breakfast and one of the owners greeted us with ""You must have woken them up!"" When he came in to start breakfast, he had heard someone come down the stairs and say ""Hello!"" but when he turned around there was no one there.

Late that night I was lying in my bed almost asleep when I heard someone laughing in the hallway. I didn't think anything of it until I remembered that Grandma and I were the only ones staying downstairs that night, and that there was only one couple staying upstairs -and they'd gone up for the night hours ago. I knew it wasn't the owners because they lived in a little house out back of the inn, and I would have heard them coming in. I almost wet the bed when I realized that nothing human (at least not a living human) was in that hallway. But the more I listened to it, the more I decided it was just friendly, mischievous laughter and not anything evil. Eventually it stopped, and I went to sleep.

The next morning was our last day there. My grandma got up early and took a shower while I was still in bed. She was adjusting the water when she felt someone snap a towel across her back -not hard, but playfully. Of course she thought it was me and came out of the bathroom to yell at me -but I was still asleep!

All in all, it was an interesting experience but not really a frightening one. I think that the spirit (or spirits) there are friendly. I've met a few ghosts before and since, but so far not any malevolent ones -and I hope it stays that way!

Attacked by a Dark Entity,British Indian Ocean Territory,Demons / Possessions / Exorcisms,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Demons / Possessions / Exorcisms :: Attacked by a Dark Entity

M ost of you are regulars here and know me quite well. You know I am not a man prone to flights of fantasies and I am pretty well grounded. I offer advise freely and with out malice or judgment. I have had a few heated debates with a person here, whom I will leave nameless, and this person they hate me, for what ever reason, though I harbor no hate or malice towards them.

Now after the event that took place on the night of the 14th of May 2007, I do have a strong dislike of them. I was attacked by a lower level entity on that night. An evil being of total darkness and filth, I don't even know how else to describe it. It was darker than any black you could imagine and in the form of mist. I wasn't afraid of it, something just told me not to fear it, not to feed it the energy it needed.

It tried to enter my body, not once but twice, it was the most revolting thing I have ever felt, I felt disgusting and dirty and worst of all violated. This thing had my stomach doing loops and churning like crazy and my heart rate zoomed. I was asked by a friend if I heard voices or anything while being attacked, to which I replied that I was unable to hear anything, it was like being in a void, no light and no sound, whether this was from the concentration I was using to fight this being or because it some how blocked all the light and sound, I don't know.

I was able to defeat this entity and banish it back to where it came from with the light of the ONE, surrounding and protecting me. At least I hope I banished it. Afterwards, the feeling I had was one of joy and inner peace, which lasted into the next day; still have those feelings whenever I recall the end of that battle. I don't know what the purpose of the attack was supposed to be. Whether to frighten me, change my beliefs, or to take possession of my soul, but what ever it was it didn't work. But at the moment of its attack I knew, don't know how or why, but I just knew where it came from. It was from that person, whatever this thing was, it was somehow associated with the person I had mentioned earlier.

It wasn't experiencing sleep paralysis or hallucinations as I had just turned the light off and didn't even have a chance to close my eyes before it happened. I hadn't been drinking or taking any drugs legal, or ""otherwise"", either. Now I have never had to deal with anything like this attack before in my life. Yes I have had spirits hold me down or show themselves to me, yes I have seen and heard things that would cause a normal person to lose control of their bodily functions or go screaming from a room, but this is the first and hopefully last time I have ever been personally attacked by anything like this.

It is definitely not something I would wish upon anyone no matter how much I disliked them. You are probably wondering why I waited so long to post this story. Well, I wanted to give things a chance to settle down and return to normal before posting it. I am sure it will draw a lot of fire from some individuals, and support from others, but either way I am putting it out there so I am not keeping it to myself and allowing it to fester in the ""I wonder what others would say about this"" section of my mind.

It Dripped from the Wall,"Montana, United States",Poltergeists / Physical Manifestations,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Poltergeists / Physical Manifestations :: It Dripped from the Wall

A bout 4 years ago I went to one of my friend's house in Lewistown MT. They had just moved in 2 weeks prior to my visit. This was a big house, 3 floors, it sat atop a steep hill, and it gave you the chills just looking at it from the outside. And the year before during the winter, a child was killed in the alley way just behind the house while sledding.

I was 15 at the time of the incident, and our parents decided that they would go out that night.

They left around 8 pm, and left my friend, his brother and me alone in the house. We were all upstairs watching TV. My friend had bought a new poster earlier that day for his wall. I knew what was exactly on the poster because I had the same one. So I watched him hang it up, we sat back down in front of the TV, 5 minutes later we turned back to the poster and to our horror a face about the size of a small plate had been drawn on to the poster with black ink.

We all ran up to the poster to examine it, his little brother touched it and said it was still wet, that's when we realized it was running out the eyes of the face and down the wall, and then discovered the ink was soaking out through the wall, we ran out of the house immediately, while we were leaving, the TV began to flip through channels, we never went back in until our parents arrived. They moved out 1 month later.

After this had happened, we discovered on the other side of that wall was his little brother's closet and inside the closet there is a crawl space which all over on the sides appeared to be scratch marks from finger nails.

I know this is something, because I don't get scared very often but every time I tell this story or even type it out like I am, my eyes begin to tear up. And that only happens when I am severely freaked out.

Old Lady in the Cemetary,"Wisconsin, United States",Apparitions / Voices / Touches,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Apparitions / Voices / Touches :: Old Lady in the Cemetary

I was at my friend's house who lives right by the cemetery. We thought it would be a good idea to look at the graves. On the way to the graveyard, Rachel, my friend, all of a sudden stopped and pointed at a grave. I followed her gaze and saw an old lady bending over a grave. I said, ""So what it is just an old lady..."" Rachel told me, ""It's not her in general but look at her feet..."" Even though I was suspicious, I looked over at the lady's feet. I felt a chill go through my bones because the lady wasn't standing, she was floating.

My friend grabbed my hand and looked back at the lady. I looked at the lady again and I saw her slowly disappearing. My mouth almost dropped and I almost screamed when I saw her face. The whole body was regular but when you saw her face, even you would scream. There were scars and burns on her face, one eye was closed, and she had a gapped tooth smile.

I felt like my feet were nailed to the ground and the look on Rachel's face told me she felt the same. As the old lady drew closer my back straightened. She didn't even go around us but instead walked through me. I was so freaked out by then that I grabbed Rachel's hand and started to run. By the time we got out of that place we were breathless.

Even though we were tired, my friend and I ran as fast as we could. When we got to her house we told her mom what had happened. She didn't believe us and told us to go to bed. I couldn't sleep because whenever I tried closing my eyes I saw her face. By the time I fell asleep it was already dawn.

It is four years later and we still hate that cemetery. Now I think the lady may be fake but whenever I go by that cemetery, I still have a chill. The psychologist I have been seeing says it was a figure of my imagination. I thought that too until I saw her again in my room. Now I can never pass a cemetery without being scared. And I am weary of old ladies, I can barely look at my grandma and she thinks I am weird. Now I am trying to forget but it just doesn't work.

I don't think I will ever look at my grandma the same way again.

Strange Memories of Dollie and Doll,"Virginia, United States",Misc,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Misc :: Strange Memories of Dollie and Doll

I 'm 17 now, but when I was 10, I lived with my parents and my brother at my grandma's house. My grandma got me this interactive doll (Dollie) and a porcelain doll (Doll). Dollie would learn to talk and walk as I played with her. I always played with them both, but my favorite was Doll.

One day Dollie stop talking, I ran crying to my brother saying Dollie's dead and he said the batteries were dead and that he'd buy new ones the next day. Later, I was playing tea party with Dollie and Doll. Dollie fell and started talking in gibberish. I got scared and grabbed Doll and ran crying to my brother. He picked Dollie up and hit her head and said everything was better.

After that, I started playing with Doll and left Dollie in the corner and I heard this girl's voice say, He hurt me. I grabbed Doll and got scarred and said ""who was that?"" and the girl's voice said, ""Me, Dollie"". I screamed and was huddled in the corner. My brother came in there and asked what was wrong, I said, ""Dollie talked"". He told me I needed some fresh air. He took me to catch some turtles. When we got back, I went up stairs and put the turtles with my other ones. And I heard Dollie say ""I'm not trying to scare you, but I do want you to kill your turtles"". I yelled, ""No go away!"". Dollie said, ""If you don't kill those turtles I'll smash Doll"".

I got really scared and picked Dollie up and put her at the bottom of my trunk and put all of my toys and books on top of the trunk. Then I went to eat with my brother. After dinner, I went upstairs to my room and started crying because Dollie was on my bed under the covers and Doll was smashed up in the floor and all my barbies heads were ripped off. When I told my parents what happened, they didn't believe me. But my dad said I seemed really scared of Dollie and that he'd take her to the dump right away.

Between now and then we've moved a few times. Everyonce in a while my dad would mention Dollie and I get scared (when I was 12 and 13). The last time we moved was last year and I was going through some old boxes and found Dollie. I took her upstairs and asked my dad why she was down there. He told me he thought I would come around and want her back. I took her to the guest room and sat her next to some books. I figured I had just imagined it all.

Me and my niece (6 at the time) were sleeping in the guest room, because my room wasn't finished yet. The next morning I woke up and got dressed and I helped my niece pick out some clothes. She told me that, last night, Dollie scared her and that she said she wanted us dead. I freaked because no one in my family talked about Dollie and I never told her Dollie's name. So I ran in the room, grabbed Dollie and threw her outside in the burnpit. I got some lighter fluid and torched Dollie.

Me and my niece sware up and down we heard yelling coming from the fire.

Schools Ghouls,"Virginia, United States",Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: Schools Ghouls

I go to this creepy high school. Everyone knows it's haunted, there's a girl and a guy in a black coat. They did a show about it on X-files. I'm not a big fan of the supernatural ever since Dollie (she's in my other story). I prefer to ignore things like that. Well, I was heading for class from the nurses and I heard this girl crying and asking for help. I went in the bathroom and she was in the corner crying. She had an old kind of clashing dress and blonde breaded pigtails. I looked at her and said ""What's wrong?"", she didn't look at me. Then she collapsed on the floor. I got my phone and texted my friend Nina ""HELP!, in the upstairs bathroom"". I got down and pushed the girl on her back. While I was trying to find a pulse, Nina came in there and asked what was wrong. I told her that I got a pulse and that I was going to do CPR. I told Nina to get the nurse. I got up to get some paper towels to put on the girl's forehead and Nina said ""What if the nurse...Where's the girl?"" I turned around and the girl was gone. We bolted out of there and back to class. The teacher said that we looked like we saw a ghost. And Nina's big mouth said ""WE DID!"" And the teacher asked ""Was it the girl or the guy?""

A few weeks later, I was waiting after school for my boyfriend to get out of detention. I told him I was going to walk around and see if any doors are unlocked. Well, I went to my drama class and the door wouldn't open so I walked away, then the door opened and I figured I'm weak. So I was going through some of my grades changing them (shh...), when I saw this old guy in a long black trench coat. He was staring at me, the door opened and my boyfriend came in and asked ""who's this old man, Kirsten?"" And the guy just started at us with these evil eyes. They give me nightmares sometimes. Because they were black and narrow and he just disappeared.

The Ghost on the Bus,American Samoa,Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: The Ghost on the Bus

T his story was about 3 years ago. Me and my family lived in California. I had to transfer schools from Alabama. My mom read to me all the schools in the newspaper and she let me choose which one I wanted to go to. She said one has a haunted bus and it was a bunch of myths, so I went to it. And tomorrow was my first day.

When I woke up the next morning, I got on my bus, the lady welcomed me and told me to go to the last seat on the very last boy row and so I did, and when I sat down, an old friend of mine turned around and told me I should ask to move, I asked why and he said ""back in 1896 an old man from the KKK killed a little girl on this seat"" and I said, ""that didn't happen"". He said ""oh yes it did. OK, don't believe me"".

That afternoon I went to my bus to go home and when I got to my seat, for a second I thought I saw a shot little girl laying down in my seat. She was mumbling my name. When I got home I told my mom what I saw. She talked to the bus driver about it, the bus driver told her it is just a imaginary thought. My mom agreed. When I got home she told me to stop thinking about it and I did.

The next morning I got on the bus and when I sat down I looked out the window and the little girl was holding a gun and she was mumbling a word, but I never went back to that school.

The Skinned Dog,"Ohio, United States",Apparitions / Voices / Touches,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Apparitions / Voices / Touches :: The Skinned Dog

I know this story is going to be a little unbelievable but most of my stories are. I was 17 years old and was staying with my best friend Anna. It was a pretty average night hanging out in her living room. We had just put her son to bed and were having a great time laughing and talking of old times. Now the way her house is set up is you walk into the living room. From this point in the house you can see the hall that leads into the bathroom and kitchen. I was sitting on the far side of the room and had a perfect view of down the hall. I sat against a wall on the floor. Anna sat across from me completely facing me. I wish she had seen the thing I did.

As I said, we were laughing and were happy. The next thing I remember is looking in to the hallway because I thought I had seen something move from out of the corner of my eye. At first, I thought that somehow her son had climbed out of the crib and was moving in the hallway (which at the time was 3 months old). I looked, expecting nothing, but I was wrong. I had to look twice, almost like a double take. The image I saw didn't quite register in my mind and still doesn't.

I looked and I saw one of the most horrifying things ever imaginable. And it takes a lot to even spook me. There in the hall, starring me down, was what appeared to be a skinned dog! It was still bleeding and had some attachments of skin stuck to it. I could see every muscle. Its eyes were locked on me and it seemed to be growling but it had no lips to be growling from. They just weren't there. Its eyes looked so angry and it didn't move its gaze one inch from me. I can still see the image in my head as if it is still happening. It did not move its position any closer but did not retreat either.

When I saw this creature, I immediately stopped laughing and jumped from the floor. Anna kept asking what is wrong. She didn't see it. All I could do was point at it. I don't know why but I was too scared to speak and didn't dare move. All I could think is ""what is it?"" Anna had grabbed my arm and pulled me close to her. I guess she had seen my face. It was as if I was frozen. Then I finally spoke and tried to frantically tell her what I had seen but when I looked, it was gone. I was speaking so fast by this time she couldn't understand me.

It had taken me hours to calm down. And finally was able to explain what I had seen. It was unbelievable. I didn't sit in the same spot ever again and never walked in the hallway alone after that night. I never saw it again after that but I can see it perfectly in mind everyday. I even have nightmares sometimes.

The very odd thing about this, and I don't know if this is related, but after that I think anything is possible, my beloved german shepherd's chain was found in the back yard three weeks later snapped at the end. No dog to be found. The chain was pointed into the woods. My dog was not the type to run off. Even if he got loose, he would always stay in the yard. My father said he may have chased some coyotes into the woods. My dog never returned.

Sometimes I think the image was a warning of some sort about my dog. Until this day I don't know. It is a burned image in my mind. Not many believe me except for my friend that was there that night. But I know what I saw!

Glimpse of a White Figure,"Florida, United States",Apparitions / Voices / Touches,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Apparitions / Voices / Touches :: Glimpse of a White Figure

I 'm skyler cox, when I was 13 years old, I saw something I'll never forget. I was with my uncle mark, posting a house up for sale. We were locking up and I saw a black cat so I decided to chase it out of the house, the tile was wet and I was in my socks, the cat went down a hallway and I caught a glimpse of a white figure, shaped into a 7 year old girl. The residence from the house stated that a girl died from a small fire coming from the lamp in her room.

That night I couldn't sleep. Having a dream of the girl scared me so I woke up. I went to get a glass of water, but the refrigerator was opened for me and a full glass of water was sitting on the counter beside me. I rushed to my room and got my four wheeler key, and drove to my next door neighbor, tyler busbee. I finally got my glass of water from his house, and stayed the night with him.

That morning I went home but the doors were locked and my parents were still gone on vacation. So I went back to tyler busbee's house and waited until my parents got home and when I told them about everything, they didn't believe me. The refrigerator door was closed and there was no glass of water on the counter.

I can guarantee that what I saw was real but I really don't know. Now I'm 14 years old and I have never experienced anything like it.

In the Company of Orbs,"Florida, United States",Orbs / Lights / Mists,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Orbs / Lights / Mists :: In the Company of Orbs

W hen I was about 7, I used to see this orb. It was a dimly lit ball of light, about the size of a grapefruit. I saw it every single night for about 2 months. I could watch it for about 5 minutes or so, before it would disappear. It would stay within 10 feet of my bed. Sometimes, it wouldn't move much at all, and other times it would move slowly across the room.

One day, I asked my dad if he would sleep in my room so he could see it. That night, the ghost appeared within 2 feet of my face, I was scared at first but then gazed into it for about 10 seconds, I only saw light slightly moving inside, nothing particular. But I nudged my dad awake, he was half asleep an rolled over with his elbow outstretched, and hit the ghost by accident. The ghost disappeared and never came back.

I moved to my mom's house and when I was about 14, I was awakened one night in a panic, for no reason, drenched in sweat and saw a large orb at the end of my room, oval shaped like 3 feet long, and it was there about 4 seconds before disappearing.

I'm 23 now, I would like to see the ghosts but I'm actually really scared of them because they always appear at night for some reason after I'm already asleep, and it scares you when you wake up, wondering how long they been watching you. I think in some ways I have blocked them out somehow since it's been so long now since I have seen one.

How can I go from seeing one every night to none at all for like 9 years now? I'm kind of curious about them and scared at the same time. If it is indeed because of mental walls I have made against them, or something, I would like to work on removing them and getting another chance to see one. Or maybe it was just the house I was living in, I'm not sure.

One time in the same house, 3 other people saw the same ghost at the same time. We were all playing around in the living room, and out of fun I blurted out ""look a ghost is coming out of my brother's room!"" Wveryone looked and laughed because they knew it was a joke but sure enough, a ghost started coming out of my brother's room!

We all ran out of the house. But that goes to show it must have heard or been watching us because it responded to what I said. Weird huh?

The Man On The Bench,United Kingdom,Apparitions / Voices / Touches,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Apparitions / Voices / Touches :: The Man On The Bench

H i, this is my first post, I hope you enjoy it. This happened to me a few years ago in my home town, Driffield, and I remember it was on Valentine's day. Me and my friend, Kerstie, were walking to her house one night. I forget what we were doing, but on the way to her house we had to pass this memorial garden. It has a few flowers, and a bench that faces a monument from the war, it's quite a nice place with a small river. There is a path that runs behind the bench, and this was the path we had chosen that day.

It wasn't quite dark and I remember it was around 6pm because there is a church not far from the garden, and the bells struck just before we walked by. We were both quite happily talking away until we came close to the bench. Then we both went silent, and turned to face the bench. It was very strange because we both did this at the exact same time, in mid sentence, and just stared for what seemed like ages. There was a man sat on the bench with his back to us. He seemed to be wearing a rather large coat, with a biggish collar, it was a greenish color, and he had a large bag next to him. I originally thought the bag was a small child huddled on the bench until I realized how large it was.

After what seemed like ages, but was most likely a few seconds, we both realized we were staring but we didn't seem to understand why. Then, at the exact same time, we both realized the guy had no visible head (I know it sounds lame but honestly it is true). Kerstie started to scream. She ran across the road and waited for me on the other side. I didn't quite know how to react and just continued to stare in shock. The guy didn't seem phased by Kerstie screaming, and this creeped me out a little. I thought maybe he was leaning forward, and his head just wasn't visible, so I slowly walked round the side of the bench, to see a front view. The whole time, he didn't move an inch. As I got closer, I saw that he wasn't hunched forward... He really didn't have a head... Just a gaping collar with blackness. Yet he had hands, and feet and everything else. He just sat there with his hands on his knees. At this point, fear got the better of me and I ran after Kerstie. As I caught up with her I paused and looked back... The guy was moving his arms... We then ran all the way to her house.

When we actually got home, it was the first time we spoke since we went silent and she said to me ""You did see that didn't you?""

We then talked about the whole experience, and we had both witnessed the same thing... A headless man in green, sat with a bag on a bench. She also said that she thought the bag was a child too... I thought that was kind of odd. We thought maybe it was a guy from the war waiting for his lover, or grieving for a friend lost in the war, but I doubt we will ever know.

I know it seems unlikely but this really did happen, and if it wasn't for the fact that Kerstie saw it too, I'd wonder if I really did see it. I have seen other things but this is by far the scariest.

The Night of the Spirits,"Pennsylvania, United States",Misc,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Misc :: The Night of the Spirits

T his story occurred on a warm summer night in 2000. I was 16 years old at this time. My friend Mike, his friend Matt, my step dad Paulie, and I decided to cast some spells that night. This was the first time I met Matt too. We decided to cast our spell down at the old basketball court that was overgrown and not used for years. It was such a beautiful clear night too.

We went down there and set up. You know, the usual candles. We had the candles set up in a pentagram form. I was to lead our circle in our magical workings. I all of a sudden heard words in my head in a different language that sounded like Latin. So I decided to go with it and I repeated what I heard. The next thing we knew was lightening cracked across the sky. It was so bright it lit up the town.

After that happened, we started to see ghosts everywhere. Anywhere you looked, you would see someone that had passed. About 15 minutes later, there were people""s names appearing in our hands. This was freaking everyone out but me, I was unusually calm.

So whe ended up going back to my house and sitting on my porch. As I stated before, I did not know Matt. When we were sitting on my porch, I was telling Matt about when his grandmother died, what she was wearing when she was buried, where she was buried and how old he was at the time. It freaked him out so bad that he was crying.

Around one o'clock in the morning, Mike was begging me to walk him and Matt to his house (which he lived right next to my house). So I obliged him and walked them across the yard.

I don't know what I said that night, I can't remember it at all. But I suggest that if I remembered it, that no one attempt it that isn't magically strong enough for it.

Responses to my Possession Story,South Africa,Demons / Possessions / Exorcisms,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Demons / Possessions / Exorcisms :: Responses to my Possession Story

I would like to respond to the comment made by Shane and bittersweet about my possession story . I realize that I was not very specific in my story about everything I experienced. You see I was telling my story from the perspective of assisting those that claim to understand demon behavior, to start seeing how specific demons are able to be. I deliberately left out the finer details because I was coming from the perspective of telling you that demon possessions are not just about being flung across rooms and drooling. These beings were much more calculated than that. Yes, most were only able to manifest through possessions where they do the 'typical' things, but I am speaking about a very rare type of demon that used to be able to directly influence and direct your life.

Firstly, what I would like to explain is that on my web site you will read that heaven has realized their situation and that they were just as trapped as we are and that they made a decision to stand up. If you go to the section called FAQ's we explain about the white light and how we were all trapped in the soul construct. When you better understand that heaven was not aware that they were being directed, you will realize how extensively we have all been enslaved. Beings such as Jesus and Osho will tell you in their stories that they realized what was going on here and in heaven and that all of heaven had to stand up against the white light that was controlling them.

As for forgiveness, the demons were all released by heaven through the application of forgiveness about a year ago. This was done through heaven realizing that nobody did anything to assist the demons to actually see who they really were and to assist them. So heaven, once they themselves were released from the slavery of the white light, assisted the demons. This was done through the entrapment of all demons and the application of understanding of who the being really is. They were assisted with the release of their applications as demons, one method being to show them what they were doing and were not released until they completely released themselves. What you must realize is that demons are beings like you and I, that have become de-manned. Anger, sadness, grief are but a few 'emotions' that drive beings once they've passed over to become the angriest most furious of beings. So when you take such a being and you work with them dimensionally (remember time doesn't exist in the dimensions) you have quantum understanding and corrective action. What takes humans weeks to correct is done in quantum time dimensionally (meaning everything is corrected energetically in quantum time). This was not possible before because of the white light controlling heaven, demons were left to do what they want because it creates more fear which in turn creates more enslavement of man kind. I used the word creates because now even though they no longer exist, the mind consciousness is able to become any application that is possible.

Secondly, I will mention that my experiences were much more extensive than what I mentioned. My statement was made so that you can understand firstly that demons are no longer. That what you might experience now are consciousness mind creations that can duplicate demonic experiences, hauntings and channelings. If you read articles by Kryon (on the web site) you'll see that even channels have been closed as the information that was coming through was pre-programmed by the white light.

Now as for my experiences: When I said: demons are people like you and I that can be seen and heard I did not say I did not see or hear him. What I said was he had no physical body, yet I could see and hear him as you would an apparition. I was often picked up by this demon, held by my neck and flung across the room. He could strangle me until I passed out. Intercourse and molestation happened constantly, hence the fact that I could not even leave my house. I spoke in a man's voice. Often he would integrate into me and attempt to slit my wrists. I would be walking and he would drop me to my knees, standing over me laughing. Intense headaches if I attempted to not interact with him. He was able to integrate fully into me and speak to people as well as walk around in my body. He could put me in a comatose state if he did not want me talking to somebody, therefore I staid mostly at home because unless I was speaking to him, he would put me in a trance like state.

As I mentioned, he was able to integrate into my ex and stand there yelling at me, then seconds later my ex could not remember what he had done. At the exorcism, the people who worked on me saw him and some experienced his effects, even before I told them what he looked like or how ill he could make you. If I did not do what he told me to do, he could make me vomit or pass out. If I left my house he would make me feel so ill that I would go back as soon as possible. When I was going for my 'exorcism', he told me that he would cause us to have a car accident. On the way there, a truck driver looked me straight in the eyes before attempting to push us of the road.

At any stage, I could feel his body energetically, a mass of energy with arms, a face, torso, legs. He could appear at any given moment as any apparition and many people who can see sprits would ask me who this being was that walked beside me. Once again I have given you the basic points, you are welcome to e-mail me if you would like more details. Until I discussed it with him, I was also of the opinion that molestations and job losses were just as you say. Unless you have experienced possession yourself, what I am saying sounds like a young lady who needs counseling hey? As impossible as it sounds, being picked up by dimensional hands and flung across the room is not something I would call issues with teenage traumas.

Like I have mentioned we work extensively with beings from the dimensions of which some of them use to be demons. Not all beings made it when heaven stood up as many of the older spirits would not give up their perceived power. Who we really are is not of consciousness and that is exactly how you've experienced my story. But how can heaven cleanse the demon dimension? Consciousness as pre-programmed systematic response can not fathom heaven standing up or us realizing who we really are. All it took was for us and heaven to see our own enslavement to the white light and consciousness system and from there stand up.

In the FAQ section of the web site you can read about our creators (the Annunaki), the white light and the soul construct. Feel free to discuss this with me some more. E mail me at andrea [at] desteni-universe [dot] co [dot] za

Granddad's Ghost?,United Kingdom,Family / Friends Visits,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Family / Friends Visits :: Granddad's Ghost?

W hen I was younger, about six or seven, I was asleep in my room one night and I suddenly woke up freezing cold. I put my foot on the radiator (as it was right next to my bed) and it was warm, yet I could see my breath. There was a light blue opaque man sat sitting on my bed but at first, I wasn't worried as this man looked familiar, then suddenly I realized that I had never seen this man before! So I called my parents into my room and plunged my head under the covers.

When my parents arrived the man was gone. Ever since, I haven't experienced anything else but recently I have felt a presence in the room and like I am being watched when I am just on my own with my cat.

The man was wearing an army uniform and had shaven black hair. The next day, I went to my grandma's house and saw a picture of my granddad that died before I was born and he was wearing his army uniform from the second world war.

My sister has also seen a man in her room who was wearing a light blue hood, like the one I had bought recently, who was quite tall. She tried to wake her boyfriend but she couldn't, so she hid under the covers and he disappeared.

I think she was imagining this. Does anyone have any opinions about what me or my sister have experienced? If so please write a comment thank you.

Three Black Shadows,"Texas, United States",Apparitions / Voices / Touches,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Apparitions / Voices / Touches :: Three Black Shadows

I forget specifically what night this was on. I was sleeping in my bedroom one night when I suddenly woke up. I had just raised my head when I saw three black shadow / ghosts at the foot of my bed. One of these ghosts was apparently reaching for me when I had woken up. The other two were standing still, maybe a step behind and to either side of the black shadow that was reaching for me. I never felt the ghost touch me, but it was moving away to stand upright when I had seen them. I know that the house that I am living in was originally owned by my grandparents before they had passed away and I am the only other occupant of the house. My grandparents had built the house approximately in the 1940's, I believe.

I think that two of these ghosts would be my grandparents but, since I could only make out figures of what appeared to be that of a normal person and could not make out any distinguishing features. I am not sure who or what the third ghost would have been. Since this house has only been occupied by the family, I highly doubt that if there are actually ghosts, that they would want to harm me in any way.

Even though I never really had the chance to know my grandparents very well before they both passed away, I am having trouble trying to figure out why there would be three black shadow ghosts instead of two.

The White Mist,United Kingdom,Orbs / Lights / Mists,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Orbs / Lights / Mists :: The White Mist

T his is my 2nd story on this site, and it happened on my 9th birthday (I'm now 21). This happened in my mum's house, which I think may be haunted by a friendly spirit, as numerous things have happened there, mostly small things, but they happen quite a lot. It's not the most interesting story but it was my first big experience and the first time I truly believed.

I had my best friend to sleep over and we were both talking into the night, like girls do at that age. The light was out and we were sharing a bed. Then after a while, I noticed a white mass hovering in a corner near the ceiling. It was quite bright, although it didn't light up the room, and it wasn't transparent, it was rather thick, like fog and couldn't see my wall behind it. It didn't appear to do anything, it just hovered there for about 5 minutes. I said to my friend ""Do you see what I see?"" and she suddenly ducked under the covers and started to shake. I took that as a yes and continued to watch it, but it slowly faded away. I didn't feel scared or threatened by the experience, just curious. My friend however, was quite freaked out.

Was this a ghost or some other entity? Anyone had a similar experience?

I never saw the white mist again, but I have since seen other things such as balls of light, shadows and orb type things, also in my home, and many things in other places too.

What Grabbed my Foot?,"Utah, United States",Misc,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Misc :: What Grabbed my Foot?

T his happened to me seven years ago and to this day, I still can't sleep with my legs stretched out so that my feet are near the end of the bed. I went to bed that night just like I would any other night, nothing out of the ordinary, only I awoke at 3:00 a.m. to something grabbing and tugging on my left foot. When I opened my eyes and began to sit up, what ever it was let go, my first reaction was to start yelling at my little brothers for waking me up, but then I realized that my door was still closed and if it had been one of them, I would have heard them running out or they would be standing in there with me.

I slept on a mattress on the floor (white trash I know) so no one could have hidden under my bed. My closet didn't have a door and was so crammed full of stuff that no one could have hidden in it, still thinking that it was somehow one of my siblings, I turned around to look at the clock, it was 3:00 am, this may or may not be important but it is a little odd that ever since then, I wake up every night around 2:30-3:00. Since I was still half asleep and had ruled out anyone in my house as the culprit, I just went back to sleep, which is a little odd since the next morning upon waking up I remembered what happened and was very freaked out and still had no idea what could have grabbed my foot.

There was firm pressure like a hand and the tugging was hard enough to wake me up and it didn't let go until I actually started to sit up, so I really don't think this could have been a dream. Sleep paralysis is something I have experienced a number of times and this was nothing like any of those experiences. I would love to know what other people think this may have been.

Was This a Demon?,"California, United States",Demons / Possessions / Exorcisms,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Demons / Possessions / Exorcisms :: Was This a Demon?

I 'm very close friends with two very ""sensitive"" girls. Sensitive in the paranormal sense. They both told me this story and it really creeped me out. They are pretty sure they saw a demon. The two of them were walking downtown here in the wine country. It was still light out, and they were heading for the brewery. All of a sudden they see this young man, Sam, being harassed by the police. Sam is homeless, talks to himself, has stalked people, and writes about the devil. He is pretty scary to be around.

My friends keep walking after seeing him. Slowly, a car pulls up beside them. In the back seat with the window down is a teenage girl. She is leering at them. She is wearing all black, and is almost green in skin color, much like a dead person. The look on her face was so scary that my friends took off running. One of them started to cry. As they run down the street they see the same girl standing ahead of them. It would not have been humanly possible for her to have gotten out of the car, and run down the street before them. She just appeared. They hurriedly ran into the brewery, and prayed that she wouldn't come in after them. They told me they would never wish the experience on anyone. They both have seen a lot of ghosts, but never a ""demon...""

They are wondering if the demon was connected to Sam. He seems to be interested in witchcraft, and has a very negative energy to him. He actually stalked one of the girls that saw the demon. This was previous to the encounter.

Shaky Sleep,"Texas, United States",Poltergeists / Physical Manifestations,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Poltergeists / Physical Manifestations :: Shaky Sleep

I was about 13 when this happened. I had about two or three encounters with paranormal activities but this was the most frightening. It was already 2:00 to 3:00 a.m so I decided to go to sleep since I was already sleepy. I really didn't like to go to sleep alone so I got my dog Jadah to sleep with me.

My mom had already told me that my sister's old room was haunted by an evil entity, but I wasn't really bothered by it, so I had just started to go to sleep when my dog started to whimper. She sat straight up and ran into the room since the door was open. She ran under the bed and didn't come out for about 10 min. I started to get worried so I called to her, but she didn't come.

By this time I was already scared so I called to her again, she had came out the second time I called her, but I still didn't want her to go back so I shut the door. An hour or so passes and nothing had happened so I decided to try to go back to sleep, as soon as I shut my eyes the door opened and a cool breeze rolled across the sheet. I hadn't opened my eyes yet, a couple of minutes later the bed begun to shake violently at that moment I sat straight up and my dog was growling at me.

Right at that moment she jumped at me and I threw her off of me, she immediately snapped out of it and ran to my mother's room, with me right behind her.

6 Years in a Haunted House,"Pennsylvania, United States",Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: 6 Years in a Haunted House

W hen I was 14, my mother once again moved my family, me, my little sister, step sister and brother into the first home she ever purchased. The expense was cheap, and the year was 1989. The house was located right behind the school we attended, and graduated from.

Nothing happened or felt weird at first. For me at least. My little sister said she felt strange from the beginning, as if she was being watched, and never felt comfortable. The first thing that happened was the handle on my door would turn, the door would open slightly and close. It would continue to do this until I told it to stop. Then whatever it was would do it to my sister's door.

My mother would see shadow figures run across the bathroom wall. I've seen three shadow people by my bed. I just recently found out from my little sister she went to do her laundry when she heard me call her name up from the basement, and I wasn't home. She didn't do her laundry that day. I've heard my mother from the top of the basement steps when I was doing my laundry, and she wasn't home.

The attic window would blow out of the window frame on it's own and land on the roof. One time I heard my brother walk through the house before he got home.

Who Let the Dogs Out?,"New York, United States",Old Hags / Night Attacks / Sleep Paralysis,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Old Hags / Night Attacks / Sleep Paralysis :: Who Let the Dogs Out?

B efore I begin the story, I want to lay the back story that I have never had what I would call a ghost story experience (until last night and I'm now up typing in the wee hours of the new day because I am afraid to sleep again). I grew up in a very conservative Southern Baptist family and my mom got deeply into her faith as she got older and later claimed to often see visions that I had trouble believing.

She was always tying them to her faith, either God telling her something or letting her see dark things. It's a long story but I was close to my mom from child to early college. Things escalated *weird things* with mom once I was a senior in college. I eventually decided all those visions were due to stress of her and my dad that finally erupted in divorce my senior year of college. Some STRANGE events surrounded my parents divorce that drove my mom to be committed to mental health department of a hospital for about a month (I believed that with her husband going and me heading off to Nashville to live, that she had a huge breakdown over losing two people in her life that had always been there).

I ended up growing distant from mom after she really spooked me on my first trip to visit Nashville (the trip which culminated in her hospital stay) and grew closer to my dad after all that happened. My spiritual belief system has gone from solid Christian fundamentalist beliefs (Jesus, etc) to now believing in a core foundation of faith, hope, and love as what drives me day to day but not really sure if I believe in a deity God or the Bible or if we make things happen on our own. It would be accurate to label me in spiritual turmoil and uncertainty. I'm on my spiritual journey and aware of it everyday, looking for clues in many situations/stories/personal experiences.

I currently live in NYC. I will say that recently life has been stressful because I lost my job in January due to restructuring and am about to move to Chicago. I preface my ghost experience (only a little over 4 hours ago) with these statements because with my background of faith and my fuzzy beliefs now, I'm not sure how to react to this and I don't know if this is just my mind sorting out stress/dealing with change, but the following really has me shaken. I journaled it. I will relay my journal entry and then end asking some questions of anyone reading this.

I've just had my first apparition vision. I've fallen into the same mental state (maybe the lucid dream state? I'm not sure) that I've found myself in for this particular experience previous times in this room, but being in the state has never culminated in me seeing an apparition. Previously, it has just been this feeling of a heavy weight that makes it hard to move. I was just aware that I was awake and looking at my room in a state that was not normal, as if some heavy weighted force was inside me and some phantom force was holding my eyes open and it took all my strength to move my head to look around and then I would feel the heavy weighted force suck out of me like someone sipping it out through a straw. Afterward, I'd blink my eyes and then look at the world normally again. As the following happened I was in that mental state that I've been in before...

Tonight, I fell asleep between 8 or 9 pm. Later, I was evidently sleeping on my right side with my left arm draped across and off the side of the bed. I suddenly was aware of something near my hand but it took awhile for me to catch on to it consistently being there. My mental state was very slow to react to the movement near my hand. I came to realize that the source of what was touching my hand felt hairy, so my mind immediately associated it with a dog without me even turning to see what it was. The reason for me mentally to assume it was a dog is because I had a dog named Jinjer, who is now dead, all through childhood and she would often move from my bed to my parents bed or vice versa throughout the night.

When she would come in my room I would be awakened by her jumping up and pawing me letting me know she wanted up on the bed. So in my dreamlike state yet not, my mind still being groggy thought ""oh, a dog"" before thinking ""oh, a DOG?"". I soon became aware of the silliness of a dog being there because I could tell I was still in my room and my mind associated my current room with my current living condition and the fact that we have no dogs here, so without trying to deal with the paralyzing force that made it so difficult for my head to turn to see what it was, I thought, HA, Jinjer is dead, nothing could possibly be there.

I remembered once I was logical about it, falling out of the vision state for a moment like my body and mind finally had let reality sweep away the dreamlike state. So once I felt the heaviness of that dreamlike state leave, I easily lifted my head, scanned the side of my bed, and saw that nothing was there. Not a few seconds later, after contentedly laying my head back on the pillow, the paralyzing force came sweeping into my body again and I knew it, I could tell something wasn't right. My hand was still off the side of the bed and I felt it again. The hair and the movement and at this point, even in the dreamlike state I could feel the strands of fear starting to stir. Whatever it was, was just out of the corner of my eye. It was going to take all the effort I could muscle to move my head with this weighted feeling of force. So I was successful in moving my head one slight bit and I could see the hair, just the hair (oh, and my dog Jinjer was a Lhasa Apso, so they are VERY hairy). At this point my mind was in a ping-pong match of ""get real, this isn't happening"" to ""oh my god, what is going on?"".

The logical part in my brain started wondering if my roommate had let in an animal into our apartment. So I said, ""Why is there a dog in my room? Who let the dog in my room?"" I grabbed for the dog's neck but just felt a huge chunk of hair in my grasp. By this point, I was getting spooked and thought I was hallucinating my dead dog Jinjer. I said, ""Jinjer, is that you? Is that..."" and I got so curious that I finally found the strength to force my head all the way to more than just the hair and what I found wasn't a dog *jesus, I just got chills* It appeared to be a ghost. A young girl. A young woman kneeling at my bed with her face turned down toward my hand and at such an angle that I could only feel her hair as it brushed against my hand.

She was doing something to my hands. I reacted slowly, just like I was in a movie or something... The terror slowly rippled up my chest and up my head and all I could do was whisper frighteningly, stuttering ""Get, get, get away from me. Please get away from me..."" I was too paralyzed to move my hand from her and my realization of it being an apparition overshadowed my taking the time to even notice what she was doing to my finger (a part of me thought maliciously that she was gnawing at my finger, but with it being my first ghost experience, my mental state was so terrified that I can see how I'd imagine the worst). She could have been just caressing it. I didn't necessarily feel pain, just a tingle.

I felt the heavy weight suck out of me like someone sipping it out through a straw and then immediately fell on my pillow awake and leaned up and brought my hand to my mouth and was so scared that I just started crying. I've never really thought about seeing a ghost since it has never happened to me before and maybe I didn't really believe they did exist, but this really shook me up.

I've lived in this apartment for nearly five months and this is my first time to experience seeing a vision like that. I have been in that dreamlike, weighted state before while in this room but never seen anything. Do you think that she could've been there when I was in the same mental state before but I just wasn't curious enough to force my head to move around to look and find her there like I did this time?

I swear I had not been drinking. I've never, never, never taken illegal substances in my life and am VERY picky about the over the counter medications I take as well. I'm all about healthy eating and taking as few medicines as I can. More into holistic stuff, natural stuff.

This experience has really scared me and I know I might should react to her with less fright if I see her again and try to find out what she is doing, but just the idea of a ghost is quite fearful for me.

Do any of you, when you have experienced visions, have the heavy weighted feeling where it takes all the strength you can muster just to move your head?

I'm curious what other people might perceive about this. I will answer any additional questions... I've been up since 11:33. I had to go out and get some juice and a snack at a bodega. I texted a best friend who is a neighbor. I really wish I had a boyfriend to keep me company but not in a relationship currently so I sleep in my room alone so I was frightened to go back to sleep.

It is just now getting daylight again. So I'm about to try to sleep again. I'll let you know if she returns or if any other strange visions occur.

thanks for reading. I will answer any questions you might have.

Lady Ghost Beside the Road,Philippines,Apparitions / Voices / Touches,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Apparitions / Voices / Touches :: Lady Ghost Beside the Road

T his story happened quite a long time ago, and so decided to post it here before I forget. In this story, it covers many things I have seen with my naked eye in which this time, my parents sees it as well. We where driving in this dark highway called ""Daang Hari"" (meaning Kings Road) at a speed of 100 km/h. The highway is newly build and beside it was this really tall grasses and they did not put any street lights in it, so it is like a fast way to go because it is like a shortcut.

We where driving when suddenly a lady walk past in the highway wearing full white dress and looks as if she is lost. We were driving at 100km/h so we almost had an accident because of the lady we saw. When we were about to stop, we bumped the lady and so we had to park on the side and check the lady. When me and my dad got out from the car, we didn't see a lady lying on the ground, but when my dad told me to check everywhere for the lady, I bothered to check and so decided to check in front of the car. I turned automatically at a far end distance, I saw a lady walking towards me with a full white clothes, and a pretty attractive one. When I saw the lady, I was really getting ready to see her proper face. But when she looked at me, it was scary because her face is burnt and could see her flesh.

The Hand Wave of the White Lady,Mauritius,Apparitions / Voices / Touches,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Apparitions / Voices / Touches :: The Hand Wave of the White Lady

I am riya, I am 12, I live in the capital of mauritius-port louis. It was another normal day of my life, but I did not know what was going to happen to me. I lived in a three stories house. There were five rooms in our house, the fifth room was on the top floor, where rarely anyone from my family used to go. That day, I was forced to clean up that room all by myself, it wasn't that I was scared, it was just that I used to get negative vibes from that room.

When I entered that room, the door was opened, but as I took steps towards the boxes kept there, the door shut with a sudden thump.

I got really scared and tried to open the door. Suddenly, I heard some noise from behind me, I slowly turned, and I saw a white lady standing there. Her head was down, so I could not see it. I got extremely scared, and started shouting for help. No one came. I took baby steps towards that lady, and I had the shock of my life! The lady put her head up, and nothing was there!, no eyes, no nose, nothing!

I screamed my lungs out! Slowly, the lady started to wave at me, and suddenly, before I could even think about what was happening, she disappeared!

That day, my family and I went to the landlord of the house, and he told us that our house had been built on a cemetery. The next week after this incident, we left the house. And I could never forget that incident in my life.

The Light Show,United Kingdom,Orbs / Lights / Mists,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Orbs / Lights / Mists :: The Light Show

T his is my most recent major experience, which happened about a year ago. This was also at my mum's house, but in a different room to my old one. My mum converted the attic a few years ago (as we live in a bungalow) and the attic then became my new bedroom. Now attics in general are creepy, but this particular experience wasn't creepy at all, it was actually quite amazing.

I normally close my curtains at night, because when cars drive by, I can see flashes of light reflect on my walls and it keeps me awake. But on this night, I had forgotten to close them. I wasn't asleep, in fact I'd just gone to bed and I was laying with my back facing the window with my eyes open. Suddenly the room lit up for a split second, it was as if the light had come on. I assumed it was either cars or lightening and rolled over to face my window. Sure enough it happened again, but this time something bright appeared to hit my window. Shocked, I thought lightening had struck my window. So I decided to go over and check the frame. There was nothing there, no marks or anything. Confused, I looked outside and was amazed at what I saw before me.

There was a large orb floating around my neighbors garden. It appeared to vibrate, was about the size of a tennis ball and it was bright white. Then it started to moved extremely fast, so fast that all I could see was a white trail behind it. Much like when a child waves a sparkler around but bigger. I watched in amazement as it continued to float around, and leave its trails. At times it moved so fast it seemed to just teleport, and when it did this, the whole sky lit up like lightening... I then realized this was the light from before. After about 5 minutes or so, it finally disappeared with one last flash of light. I felt really sad and stayed by the window for another 10 minutes. The whole experienced just filled me full of joy, and confusion, as I wasn't entirely sure what I'd seen.

The next morning, my mum said that when she went outside she had a strong urge to look up at my window, but she didn't know why. I then explained what had happened and she believed me. I wonder if she sensed something.

Ever since, I've kept my curtains open when I stay at my mum's house, but I have never seen the orb again. But if I did, I wouldn't be scared that's for sure. They seemed so friendly with good vibes.

The Boy Upstairs,"Missouri, United States",Apparitions / Voices / Touches,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Apparitions / Voices / Touches :: The Boy Upstairs

H ello my name is Carolyn and I have a spooky true tale to tell you. My boyfriend and I moved into this 2 story house. The upstairs had 2 bedrooms and a bathroom. The downstairs had 2 bedrooms, 1 bathroom, a kitchen dinning room and kitchen of course. My boyfriend Chip went upstairs to take a bath and well, like most men, he forgot his towel. So about halfway through his bath he called for me to bring him a towel. So I got his towel and started to the upstairs bathroom. When I got to the top of the stairs, I went to the bathroom and he had it locked so I told him to unlock it. He said for me to wait a minute.

So I stepped back against the wall facing one of the bedrooms up there. At first, I didn't see any thing but when my eyes adjusted to the dark I saw something sitting on the bed. It was what appeared to be a young boy. I didn't believe what I saw so I walked closer to the bed and I know that my face turned white because, sure enough, there was a young boy just sitting on that bed starring at me and he gave me the feeling that he wasn't very friendly. There was no one else in that house except for my boyfriend in the bathroom and me.

I started screaming for him to unlock the door and I was crying very hard. He let me in and I told him what was going on so he went to check the room but he saw nothing. Now I know what I saw and whatever it was I think it just wanted to scare me! Needless to say I moved out about a month later. Thank you.

The Blue Eyed Monkey,"Missouri, United States",Pets / Animals,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Pets / Animals :: The Blue Eyed Monkey

T his takes place around 5:30 am. My husband and I were asleep in our room and our two boys were in their room. My oldest son James came into my bedroom and woke me up. He told me he that something woke him up. I told him to try and go lay down for a little bit longer and I will wake him up when it's time for breakfast. He said ok and walked out of the room and down the hallway to his bedroom.

Not even 30 seconds later I heard him SCREAMING to the top of his lungs and running as fast as he could! He ran into my room and jumped into my bed. I asked him what was wrong franticly and he just kept saying over and over ""there's something in my bed!"". I finally calmed him down and asked him what had happened and he told me that when he got to his room, he walked through the doorway to get to his bed and, I know this sounds stupid and unbelievable, but he said that there was a giant thing that looked like a monkey just sitting on his bed starring at him. He also said that it was breathing very hard you could hear it. And then he told me that (and this really freaked me out) that this thing had the same color eyes that he did, which are blue. I asked him how he knew it was a monkey and he described it to me and he looked at me and said I stared at it just long enough that I could even see the hair on it knuckles.

I know that this sounds like crazy talk but my son has never lied to me. He is very down to earth. I also went and looked at his bed and just at the corner where he said that this thing was sitting, there was a very deep indent like something very heavy was sitting in that spot. Needless to say that scared me even more. I do not let anyone in that room and my son now shares a room with his younger brother.

Pinned to my Bed by a Spirit,"Florida, United States",Old Hags / Night Attacks / Sleep Paralysis,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Old Hags / Night Attacks / Sleep Paralysis :: Pinned to my Bed by a Spirit

A bout 10 months ago, in August, I had been having very strange occurrences. Every time I'd go to sleep, I would feel a presence as if someone or something was watching me. There was one night that I was trying to fall asleep, but I couldn't because I heard something else breathing with me. That's when I told my ex-boyfriend, he thought that I was overreacting. I tried to ignore the presence as much as I could, until one night my ex-boyfriend and his friend came over my house at around 2am, his friend said that he thinks the Santeria bracelets [click for picture] that I had on were the reason something was watching me.

He looked at 1 of the bracelets and found that one of the eyes had 2 black dots instead of one. That means that someone had placed an 'evil eye' on me. We burned it and checked if the other bracelet had anything, but it didn't so I left it on.

That night I fell asleep without a problem. I had a strange dream though that the bracelet was still intact. All of a sudden, I woke up laying on my back, which was strange because I had fallen asleep on my stomach and I don't move that much in my sleep. I could hear my brother getting ready for school so I figured it was around 5:30am. Being that early, I tried to go back to sleep but as soon as I closed my eyes I felt something touching my shoulders and before I could even try to figure out what it was, I was pinned so hard that I could feel my bed denting.

I could still hear my brother's footsteps outside my door so I tried to scream but all that came out was a wisp of breath. I began to panic, trying to kick myself free but no use, the pressure on me just increased. I started to hear a strange sound that I can only describe as the sound of wind blowing, it was rushing through my ears, growing louder and louder. I started to feel as if my insides were moving (not painful but not a comfortable feeling either). I felt like it was trying to pull me out of my body. I prayed silently to God to please make it stop, and as soon as it did I ran out my room and went downstairs. My brother was eating breakfast; it was 6:15am.

I checked the bracelet that I still had on again and was shocked to see that one of eyes had 2 dots in it, but when we checked it didn't have anything. I later found out trough my grandmother, who has contact with spirits (not by choice they just come as they please), that there is a spirit (man) that is envious of my body and wants it (an incubus... sort of).

Whenever I let my guard down, that spirit takes the advantage to haunt me in my dreams... He takes the physical form of a friend or family member and has his way with me. He also tried to pin me down again but it never works... All I can say is that ever since that night, I have heightened sense to when a spirit or something is in the room...

For those of you who have had this problem too, here are some things you can do:

1. Rearrange your room (mostly your bed since the spirit knows where you sleep) - what this does is confuse the spirit so it can't find you.

2. Place a small glass of water under your bed (and if not, then somewhere close to your bed) don't be surprised if the water evaporates fast, if you have a spirit in your room that's exactly what is supposed to do. IF YOU SEE IT EMPTY REFILL IT...

3. Place a shot glass of ammonia under your bed (same as #2) - what this does is scares the evil spirits away (they don't like strong smells) IF YOU SEE IT EMPTY REFILL IT...

4. Lavender incense (the real lavender) -it helps you go to sleep.

I don't know about that REM state but I really don't want to find out what would've happened if I just laid there and taken the experience. If it was a dream state then how did I hear my brother walking down stairs, and why did I feel as if something was moving my insides... DO NOT JUST LAY THERE AND TAKE IT.

I Knew,"Missouri, United States",Family / Friends Visits,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Family / Friends Visits :: I Knew

F or the first five years of my life I had unusually high psychic powers. I also have no memories of these five years. My parents, however, have not forgotten at all. I was four years old. It was ten at night and both my brother and I were asleep upstairs. It was at this late hour my parents received a call informing them that my dad's grandmother had died and the funeral would be in a few days.

They discussed things for about an hour before deciding to leave the next morning. As my dad called his work to let them know, my mother came upstairs as began packing some bags. She came into my room and I woke as she started packing. I rolled over and asked her what she was doing. My mother sat on my bed and told me that daddy's grandma had died and we had to leave in the morning for the funeral. I proceeded to say ""I know, I saw her in my dream and she told me not to be scared. She said it would be okay...""

I cried when my mother told me this story ten years after it happened. I cried because I was sad that my memories of it were gone and that my psychic abilities had diminished since then. But I also cried for happiness that I once had that power. Though I can no longer commune with the spirits I sense around me, I hope to learn why these memories are suppressed and revive them if possible.

At the Alamo,"Texas, United States",Apparitions / Voices / Touches,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Apparitions / Voices / Touches :: At the Alamo

S ome years ago, I was visiting the Alamo. The Long Barracks lives up to its name. It is a long, narrow building with entrances at each end and has been converted into an extension of the museum, with display cases along each wall. It was not crowded that day; a loose line of people moved down one side and up the other.

I was about thirty feet from the front entrance when I looked up to see a man walking toward me between the lines. He was dressed in period costume: rust-colored pants tucked into black boots, a brown belt with a plain brass buckle, and a white shirt that had a pointed collar with undone string ties dangling down on either side of the front placket. The shirt did not have proper cuffs. Instead a buttoned pleat fastened the sleeves at the wrists.

He was about six feet tall, with dark blond hair that curled down around his collar. His face was weathered and tan, and although I could not see them well, I believe his eyes were blue. But the most striking thing about him was that he was carrying what looked to me to be a Sharps buffalo rifle. He was holding it properly, the forestock in his left hand and the muzzle pointed safely toward the floor. The rear vernier sight was folded down.

I watched him carefully until he was so close to me that staring would have been rude. I looked down, felt him go by me and saw his shadow pass. Then when I looked up, he was gone. He was so tall and the crowd was so sparse that I could not have lost him in the people around me, and it was so far to the door that he could not have crossed the distance during the brief time I looked away from him. He had simply disappeared.

I am fairly certain he was among the Alamo heroes who fell to Santa Ana's army, but to this day I wish I knew which one.

Haunted Vacation,"North Carolina, United States",Apparitions / Voices / Touches,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Apparitions / Voices / Touches :: Haunted Vacation

T his story happened to me about two summers ago in North Carolina. I was on vacation and staying in a small house on a beach. I was sharing a bedroom with my older brother since the third room was small, very dark, and downright creepy. I was sleeping on the top bunk and my brother was in a normal bed on the floor.

Early in the morning, I woke up and I looked at the mirror on the wall across from me. There I saw a tall man, just a shadow, no face visible, standing. He was wearing an old fashioned hat. I looked at the floor, suspecting my brother or a trick of my eye, but there was no one. I almost died!

One afternoon when we got back from the beach, I was taking a shower. Then, as I was looking through the space where the curtain doesn't shut all the way, a large black shadow passed through the room. I got out fast!

No one else saw anything, but my mom said she got the feeling someone was watching her one late night. I never want to go back there again!

By the way, we stayed near Blackbeard's house, so we went on the tour, which was creepy! The stories they told in front of the graveyard were so scary!

These are the only ghost experiences I have ever had happened to me.

Spirit of the Little Boy,"Texas, United States",Old Hags / Night Attacks / Sleep Paralysis,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Old Hags / Night Attacks / Sleep Paralysis :: Spirit of the Little Boy

I have always had a interest in the supernatural but was a skeptic. My story might not be as scary or even scary at all but to me it was something I would never like to experience. I lived in Austin, Texas and was staying in an apartment complex that use to be a school for the disabled. I would always hear a ball bouncing and a dining table chair moving in the kitchen. When I would approach that area it would stop and move to a different area in the kitchen. The noise continued happening, I just ignored it but there was an incident when I was taking a nap and I felt someone lay next to me. I turned around to see who it was and I saw nothing, just an indention in my mattress, I was so scared I got up and ran to my mother's bedroom and told her about it.

She believed me and told me that the same thing was happening to her. A couple of nights later, I was sleeping in my bedroom. In my bedroom there is a bathroom that connects, I had the light on while I slept because, at this point, I was scared out of my mind. All of a sudden I woke up with the worst pain I ever felt in my life. I was sleeping on my stomach, my face was turned toward the wall. The pain I felt was in my back. It felt as if someone was trying to get up from my back and it was. My whole body was paralyzed, I just couldn't move. I was screaming on the inside but nothing was coming out. I could see something on me, a glowing light.

My brother was sleeping in the living room at the time and I was thinking if only my scream would wake him up, he would come in here and help me, but nothing. The ghost kept trying to get up from my body and the more and more he tried, the more and more it hurt. Finally he arose and I was able to move. I turned around on my bed and looked and saw him, the ghost was a little boy, dressed in white. He had a bowl hair cut like back in the old days. He looked and smiled and disappeared. As soon as he did, I ran into the living room and woke up my brother and of course, he thought I was dreaming. There is no way I was dreaming that.

Now I know who was moving the chairs and bouncing the ball in the kitchen and laying next to me in the bed.

Doggy Ghosts,"New York, United States",Pets / Animals,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Pets / Animals :: Doggy Ghosts

M y nanny (who is really my grandma, but we call her Nanny!) had an adorable, fat, black small poodle named, Mikey. Me, my cousins, and my sister and brother, all grew up with Mikey. When I was around 7 or 8, and Mikey was at the ripe old age of 15, he got very sick, and we made the (hard!) decision to put him down. Poodles usually live only about 15-20 years, and, in this condition, he was miserable. We all loved Mikey dearly, more than you can imagine, and no one would really think so, because, as much as we used to complain about him, the day he was put to sleep, we were all very upset.

A few weeks after he was put to sleep, my nanny was alone in the house watching TV. Her house is set up so when you walk in, you walk onto shiny stone that shines in the sunlight. Then, you turn into her carpeted den/dining room. She heard clicking noises, like nails on hardwood floors, and a jingle, and out of the corner of her eye, saw a black figure. She looked at it disappeared, but it's a little self-explanatory what you might think this was... Mikey! She never really saw anything after that (even though sometimes I thought I saw him in the reflection of the sliding doors leading to her backyard) we think Mikey had just come to say goodbye.

Unknown Soldier,"California, United States",Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: Unknown Soldier

I work at Camp Roberts in California. There is a base there that was built in the 40's used for basic training. The base was built in a matter of weeks and still stands to this day. On this base there used to be a full functioning hospital in the 200-300 block. Nine buildings that still stand from that grand hospital, eight of the nine are in a locked gated area. These buildings take about 2 minutes to walk from one side of the building to the other.

The buildings were at one time connected by covered wooden walkways that have since then been taken down. Only one still shows evidence of these walkways, Bldg 308. They took out the walkway and made steps and put in soda machines on the old platform.

Next to Bldg 308, to it's left is Bldg 307. Behind Bldg 308 is bldg 315. Behind 307 is bldg 305. Diagonally from the back of bldg 307, about 50 feet is bldg 303. Next to 303 is bldg 304. All buildings have entrances on the end of the buildings. Only in bldgs 303 and 304 is the building not built like one giant hallway.

One night, as always, my co-worker and I had to lock up. But on this night we worked late and it was already dark. We had to go into each building and make sure that both doors are locked. I had bldg 307 and 305. He took 308 and 315. I locked up 305 first and went on to 307. When I entered what we call the center of the compound after locking 307. I saw him on the platform of bldg 308 heading towards 315. I went towards bldg 308 to tell him to hurry up. Mind you, bldg 307 and 305 is like 20 ft from each other. He disappeared from my view behind the soda machines. I walked up the platform, no one was there. There is all but open space. You would be able to see anyone get down the other set of stairs. I ran over to bldg 315 to see him walking back from the other end of the bldg. That's when I realized that the person I saw wasn't him and that there is no way that anyone else could be in the compound because it's gated and locked.

When he walked out of the building he looked at me and asked what's wrong. I told him that we needed to leave, NOW! As we walked back, I told him what happened and he laughed at me. We worked there for 6 months. Nothing has ever happened like that before. We started to turn off the lights to bldg 303 since that was the last building left to lock up. He clicked off the light switch to one set of lights that has only one switch. Walked to the other wall to turn off the other half of lights and the switch to the other set of lights turned back ON!.

I looked at him and said, ""told you so. Lets GO!"" He ran to the other side of the bldg to turn off the set of lights that just turned on and we ran out the the building. Our boss doesn't believe that those buildings or any other on Camp Roberts is haunted. But me and my coworker think that's why our boss always goes home before dark.

I found out after telling this story to one of the guys on our base that have been here forever that the hospital was full of people from the war that were there to recuperate from war injuries or diseases they caught, boot camp trainees, and Italian POWs housed at Camp Roberts. The 300 block was the death prep area.

Golden Lady,"South Dakota, United States",Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: Golden Lady

F irst of all, I must tell you that this story is not totally mine. I am a member of a ghost hunting group out of South Dakota. One of my group member's son had this experience in his old house. He is young, probably about 7 or 8 at the time. He would often wake up in the night and see a shadow person in his room as well as the figure of a woman. She was gold in color and hooded. His mother just shrugged it all off as him still being half asleep. She told him that he should just ignore it.

A while later while at a ghost hunting conference, she met up with someone who was publishing a book about shadow people and everything she said about them fit exactly with what her son had told her. She decided to take him seriously after that. She researched the golden lady as much as she could, but she came up with nothing. I myself have looked into it extensively and still have gotten nothing. She left a message on a ghost hunting forum about it and the response she got was ""it is really bad"" but they refused to elaborate about it.

I have seen pictures here about the golden lady and I wonder if anyone can tell me exactly what she is? I would love to go back to that house and investigate if she is a malcontent spirit. Can anyone help me out?

Crapping Out,"Tennessee, United States",Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: Crapping Out

I 'm a fifty-year-old sober, drug-free grandmother. My sanity has never been questioned; not to my face, anyway. My folks settled in the foothills of the Cumberland Mountains in Tennessee, and we have what might be described as a very country way of speaking. Ghosts, or haunts, are 'haints' to us. Around here, the word 'such' is sometimes pronounced 'sitch'.

One winter night, when I was about seven years old, I was at my aunt's house. The adults were in the living room, sitting around the fireplace, talking. We kids (my brother, our cousins, and I) were scampering all over the house, playing hide-and-seek, raising the occasional ruckus, and generally having fun. I was hiding in an old wardrobe when I noticed that the grown-ups had lowered their voices. I jumped out of the wardrobe and, for optimum listening purposes, scuttled behind a bedroom door.

They were telling ghost stories. One, particularly chilling, story involved an abandoned house. It was said that in this house, at a certain time of year, one could hear a baby crying just before midnight, then on the stroke of the hour itself, a coffin, containing a baby, would appear in the parlor.

The grown-ups sat there a moment, looking at each other. Then Aunty reached for my hand and pulled me over to stand beside her chair.

""Honey, we're just sitting around telling a bunch of old stories. Just passing time, is all,"" she said. ""Now, some parts you heard might be true..."" Before I had time to wonder which parts she was talking about, Aunty, looking me straight in the eye, declared, ""but there ain't no sitch a thang as a haint...""

I took her words to heart. They echoed authoritatively throughout several decades of my life.

Many of my childhood friends believed in ghosts. They wouldn't go near a cemetery unless they had to, fearing a haint would get them if they did. Smugly secure in my belief that ""there ain't no sitch a thang as a haint"", I took shortcuts through graveyards whenever it was convenient, day or night.

Later on, when my daughter wanted a Ouija board, I got her one. ""There ain't no sitch a thang as a haint"", so why shouldn't she have one of those Ouija toys to play with?

For some forty-odd years, I lived a happy, haint-free life. But not anymore.

I recently worked for a gentleman who sold repossessed mobile homes. On the lot one morning, Bill, a co-worker, called me on the radio and summoned me to #087, a newly arrived double-wide. I climbed up inside it.

He was standing in front of the tub with a sour look on his face. I walked in, then backed right out. The bathroom stank to high heaven. There were mounds of dead flies on the window sill and on the floor behind the toilet.

Bill shook his head. ""I don't know. But we'll have to find out. Ain't nobody going to buy a trailer with a bathroom that stinks like this...""

Over the next several days, Bill, and I, along with three others, worked on #087. We searched high and low for the source of that stench. We removed wall panels and examined the hidden interior room that housed the furnace and water heater. We poked around between the vapor barrier and flooring. We flushed the drain traps. At one point, in fits of desperation, we even peeled back the bathroom carpet and padding. We found no evidence of any leaks, no dead vermin, nothing.

In the course of these events, we noticed some odd things about the odor. For one thing, it was sporadic. Whenever it showed up, piles of dead flies showed up with it. The smell would dissipate, but the flies stayed behind. We had to suck them up with a hand vac. Also, the odor was strong, almost overpowering, inside the bathroom. One step outside the bathroom door, though, the smell was undetectable.

Now, I've watched the same movies everyone else has watched, and I know that, confronted with this same circumstance, a lot of people would have been immediately clued in that some sort of spook was fiddle-farting around. Not I, though. Huh, uh. ""Ain't no sitch a thang as a haint"".

As a matter of fact, one of the guys did say something about #087 being possessed, instead of repossessed, but he was joking. As far as I know, that's the only allusion to the supernatural that any of us made.

We opened windows. We sprayed disinfectant, and set out air fresheners. We burned scented candles and incense. If it smelled good, we tried it. Finally, three days passed with no odor presenting itself, and we thought we had cured it. Maybe we did.

On a hot, very busy, day in September, I climbed up inside #087 to get started on one final job that had to be done before the home would be ready to sell. A sheet of drywall in the dining area needed to be replaced. I was measuring the wall when the toilet in the master bathroom flushed.

I nearly lost my religion, right then and there. Here I was, in a sweltering, airless trailer, sweat pouring off me, and some idiot, probably a prospective buyer, had just used a toilet that wasn't hooked to a sewage system. It was not unusual for these used mobile homes to arrive on the lot with enough water for a flush retained in their lavatory tanks. And, despite taped-down lids, and do-not-use signs, people sometimes did avail themselves of the facilities.

I dropped my tape measure and went stomping off toward the bathroom. On the way down the warpath, it didn't dawn on me that, until I had entered it, this trailer had been locked.

The bathroom door was standing wide open. The pig hadn't even bothered to close it. He was standing right there in front of the throne, hitching up his pants, with his right side facing me. He was tall, had a beer gut, and a mop of tangled, red hair. He had on jeans, and a gray muscle shirt that looked as though it had seldom seen the inside of a washing machine. His pudgy arms were covered with jailhouse tattoos; one was a pair of dice rolled to snake-eyes. I remember wondering why he hadn't opted for boxcars. Attached to his belt, there was a leather sheath with, what appeared to be, a six-inch boot knife in it.

""Um, sir?"" He went from 'pig' to 'sir' in the span of a heartbeat. A sight like that will just naturally take the wind out of your sails.

Judging from the look on his face, he was surprised to see me, which was puzzling, because he had to have heard my approach. As we stared at each other, his expression changed, becoming sullen. I perceived a threat. He lowered his head slightly, still watching me. His right hand reached for that blade. Then he clicked off. He just wasn't there anymore. It made me dizzy. Either I had just witnessed a ghost, or I had a horribly defective mind.

I said that out loud, hastily departed, and took a break outside, wondering how I was going to get that Ouija board away from my daughter. I decided to do what all parents do whenever a child acquires something she's better off without: I'd buy something bigger, better, and more expensive, and attempt to negotiate a trade. I thought about my childhood jaunts through the local cemeteries. No telling what kind of boogers had been lurking in the shadows back then, just waiting to pounce on my unsuspecting self.

I saw the apparition only once, and I never smelled the foul odor again. The last time I was inside #087, the whole trailer smelled like a smoked coconut, thanks to our dedicated freshening efforts.

Shortly after all this happened, my employer had a heart attack (not haint-related, as far as I know). Resulting health issues forced him to sell his inventory, including #087, to other dealers around the region. It's an attractive mobile home, so it's reasonable to assume someone has bought it by now.

It's a '96 model, 28x48, with three bedrooms, and two baths. It has beige siding. All the front windows, including a large, and very lovely, bay window, are trimmed with red shutters. There is a rectangular skylight in the kitchen. The ceiling in the dining area has a framed mirror with a swag light dangling from it. An identical mirror, sans light, is mounted to the wall behind the pastel yellow garden tub in the master bath.

If this sounds like your home, you might want to arm yourself before going to the bathroom. Or, at least, knock before you go in. Because there is such a thing as a haint, and you just might be living with one.

Family Home,"Kentucky, United States",Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: Family Home

W e lived in this home, I am going to tell you about the place first, when you come in the front door, you had the living room and on the right was the kitchen, on the left was a hallway, you go throw the hall on the right is one bedroom and next on the right was the bathroom and them the big bedroom. You go back to where the kitchen is and there a hall away on the left is a bedroom and then across from the bathroom is a back door on the right. There is the washer and dryer and then another bedroom.

One night, me and my kids were in our living room watching tv. I looked back to where my room was and I saw the hall light on. I went and turned it off and come back and set down. When I sat down, my son said ""mom the light is on"". I looked at my kids, I said ""did one of you go back there, I know they didn't"" I thought I would ask, but they said nope.

I told my son to go turn it off, when he was walking back there he came back running, he said ""mom there a man back there"" I said ""what?"" he repeated ""there a man back there!"". I got up and went in there, no one was there but my back door was open. I got my kids and went to my sister's, she was next door to me.

We called the cops, they came and looked the places over. He said no one could have come in the back door. But he would stay with my sister and tell my husband when he got home. Well, after that, things would happen around the house. We would put things down and go back to get it and it was moved. My son liked his bedroom room door open, but it would close when no one was in there. My sister came and she said ""you all have got a spirit in your home"". I said ""yea more than one"".

Well we lived there for awhile. My kids did not like to sleep in their room and their friends would not come and stay with us. They would get up at 2am crying, they called their mom or dad to come and get them. What ever it was, it never hurt us none of them.

The White Figure Ghost,United Kingdom,Apparitions / Voices / Touches,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Apparitions / Voices / Touches :: The White Figure Ghost

A few years ago, in May 2005, me and a friend were out, still only being young (15-16), we were sitting in a plot of private land. There used to be a house here which was burned down a few years prior to this, the house was supposedly abandoned when it was burned.

It started to rain so we took shelter under a large tree, being lazy we decided we wanted to sit down, however it was muddy. My friend said he knew where a few wooden pallets had been dumped. It was just across the other side of the field over a small broken fence.

So we walked down there and climbed over the fence. As soon as I got over the fence, I wasn't happy, the place felt eerie and uncomfortable, also very cold as opposed to where we had just been. It was quite a wooded area, a grassy hill then leading down into a lot of overgrown bushes and trees where a bunch of wooden pallets lay. We walked down, picked up the pallet and started walking back up the hill, friend in front, me behind him.

We had taken about 5 or 6 steps when my friend turned around to look at me as he said something, and almost instantly, as he looked at me, his gaze was taken away from me and directly past me. He went white as a sheet, dropped the palette, and ran off. Confused, I turned around and, about 10 meters behind me to the left in the trees, there was a white figure. At first I thought it may have been a plastic bag caught in the trees. I looked back to my friend and shouted for him to stop being stupid and help me carry the pallet. I then looked back, however the white figure was now to the right of me and about 4 meters away, and I could clearly see a white smokey figure. I dropped the pallet and ran. I have never gone back to that field ever since. I remember the feeling about the place so well, tingly, cold, uncomfortable, as if you as being watched.

A few days later, we found out that when the house was burned, apparently someone had died in the fire, at this point we hadn't told anyone about what we saw. Also a few people had said where saw this... thing, there used to be a rope swing. Many people had for no apparent reason, let go in mid swing, falling and breaking a wrist, or an arm, most people with just a few cuts and bruises.

But what I ask is, did we see a ghost? Is this why it felt so eerie down there, is this the reason why people were just letting go of this swing? Was this figure the person that died in the fire. Or was it just a figment of my imagination.

We don't speak of that afternoon anymore, every time I think about it, a chill runs through my body, my eyes water, I feel the same feeling I felt that very day.

The Little Boy Upstairs,"Missouri, United States",Apparitions / Voices / Touches,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Apparitions / Voices / Touches :: The Little Boy Upstairs

I n 2005, my boyfriend at the time and I moved into a two story home in the town we were living in. I didn't care for the house to much. It didn't scare me but it did give me the chills. One night, my boyfriend went upstairs to take a bath. I stayed down stairs and was watching a movie. After he had been in the bathtub for a while, he yelled out asking me for a towel. So I went to get him a towel and started up the stairs. At the top of the stairs there is a bedroom to the left and to the right. As I walked towards the bathroom door, I quickly glanced into the bedroom to the right and I thought I saw something but I didn't really pay any attention to it. I went to open the bathroom door but it was locked so I told him to hurry up and unlock it. While he was getting out of the bathtub, I turned to the right and leaned against the wall facing the bedroom.

That's when I saw it or him or whatever it was. There was what appeared to be a little boy sitting on the bed in the room just staring at me. Its body was black, you could see the shape but that was it. I could see the eyes though. I was terrified. I started screaming and yelling for him to let me in. I think that it was a demonic presence because of the way it made me feel. I have never been so scared in my entire life.

He finally let me in and I made him walk me down the stairs, the boy was gone by then and we moved out two weeks later. Before we moved out, I never went upstairs again. I still live in the same town but I will not drive by that house, I am still to terrified.

Summer School Dream,"California, United States",Misc,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Misc :: Summer School Dream

I had gone to California from my house in Florida (which took TWO plane rides) to see my brother, Blake. He was 24, going on 25 next month. This story takes place just barely after my encounter with the evil spirits in my old home. After I got off the plane, I had to get a taxi, which wasn't too hard and went to Blake's work; the Pontiac Hotel. I stayed there for free, in room 221. I loved the room, it was a large, one roomed place with a largish kitchen.

After a week, I decided to stop freeloading and go to summer school every other day. One, mildly warm day, I fell asleep in class. Raven, one of the friends I had made, tapped me on the shoulder, and I tiredly slapped it away. But then it happened again. ""Miss,"" she said. Raven never said Miss. I peered up, no loner sleepy. What I saw wasn't Raven, but a woman in a long dress, a schoolteacher from the 1900's. I fell back in my chair, screaming. ""Miss!"" she helped me back up, and I looked around. Kids. Kids that wore those old clothes off the golden days.

I turned and ran. Of course, screaming. Something was jacked, I remembered I said. I flew through a door and slammed it shut behind me. I remembered my teacher saying that back then, schoolrooms were only one roomed. So what was this? I opened the window and cried for help. No one was there to help. I turned back around and started writing on the chalkboard, in large letters; WHERE AM I? And next to it wrote ""In my world, I want to play with you..."" I freaked out and an idea struck. Jump out the window. Maybe this was a dream and the shock would wake me up.

I took it, and flew out the window. I awoke, and I was in class again, covered in cuts, and bruises from the fall. What fall? It was a dream, wasn't it? I don't know what it was, but I never went back to that summer school. I never fell asleep in school again. I was forever scared of going to school in the summer, so I did good in school. Any advice to what I experienced?

All The Small Things,United Kingdom,Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: All The Small Things

I 've had many small things happen to me that aren't really worth writing separate stories for, so I thought I'd write them all together. Although, I'm sure I'll end up missing a few as I tend to forget about some things hehe.

My great grandma Christine died when I was about 2 years old. I don't really remember her well, only vaguely. She was a gypsy and I remember she used to like to sit on the floor a lot. Other than that, I don't remember her at all. But what I do remember, is I used to play with a piece of string, and I would call it Christine, and talk to it. I started doing this after she passed, and my mum found it quite odd. I also had an obsession with sitting on the floor. I've always wondered if I was somehow influenced by her from the grave.

Another thing I remember is playing in my room one day, I would've been around 4, and I heard a woman softly whisper my name. I knew it wasn't my mum and I was very confused. I heard it twice more and then I continued to play with my toys.

Once when I was at my nana's house, I think I was about 6, I saw a small black shadow dart past me and behind the fridge. At the time I didn't know what it was and I screamed for my nana to move the fridge. She thought I was being silly but I was convinced I saw something. She eventually moved the fridge and nothing was there. I think this may have been a shadow ghost.

Also at my nana's house, on several occasions I heard scratching at night. It used to really scare me and I'd make my nana search the room for monsters. This could've been mice but I doubt my granddad would've let mice in my room.

Again at my nana's house, I was sat watching a video in my nana's bed with her dog, Tuppy. I'd say I was about 10 years old, and Tuppy was asleep on my lap. He suddenly pricked his ears up and began barking at the tv... I was confused and told him to be quiet because I was watching the movie. Then the tv began switching channels on its own, I looked for the remote, it was on the side untouched. All the time tuppy was barking at the tv. I got out of bed to get my nana and the tv went back to the video. Confused, I sat back on the bed and it again flicked through channels, before turning itself off. Tuppy then ran out of the room and I ran after him. After I had got my nana and told her, we went back to the room, and the movie was playing.

I'm not sure if this is ghost related but it was quite strange. This was also at my nana's house. My nana has this stand that it quite tall, on top of it is a big pot plant. One day my cousin was walking by the stand and the plant flew off and hit her on the head. I saw the whole thing and she never touched the stand... I don't really understand how, or why it happened. Luckily she was ok but the pot the plant was in had smashed all over the floor. My nana never put a plant there again.

This one was at my mum's house, which is where 2 of my major experiences have happened, but you need to read my other stories for those. I often hear odd noises at my mum's house, but once (and I'm glad it was only once) something breathed really loud in my ear, I felt the breath on my neck and I screamed. Nothing was there, and no one was in the house but me. I think my ghost likes to play tricks sometimes.

Other times you can hear people walking around, we have a wooden floor so it's easy to hear footsteps. There is never anyone there and my mum gets a bit spooked. The attic has also been converted into a bedroom, and when someone is upstairs, you can hear the floorboards downstairs. I often hear this when I'm alone.

The strangest thing was the doorbell incident. The attic is my room, and right next to it is the doorbell sound box thingy. Every time someone rings the doorbell it was really loud in my room and it used to wake me up a lot. I complained to my mum about it and a few days later, noticed the doorbell box had been removed and the wires cut. Thinking my mum had done it, I ignored it, until she asked me later why I had disconnected it. When I told her I hadn't, she looked really shocked and quite scared. We both put it down to the ghost as no one else had done it. We never did find the box either.

Sometimes our ghost likes to help us too. We've often asked each other to find a missing item, checked the house 4 or 5 times only to find it in a really obvious place that we both checked just 2 minutes before. So now we say thank you out loud when they appear.

It seems to like moving things in the kitchen too, I can sometimes hear noises coming from there, like someone is washing up or making some food, and when I go to investigate no one is there.

Oh and before I forget, the tennis ball! This really scared my mum, but I found it quite funny really, and something I would do if I were a ghost... Or a ghost dog haha. This tennis ball appeared in our garden one day, assuming it was from next door, we threw it over the fence. The next day it was in the exact same place in the garden... So again we threw it back over. After doing this for a few days my mum decided to put it in the bin. The next day it was in its usual spot in our garden, right next to the bird bath. My mum became quite freaked out by this and picked it up and threw it hard, over the fence. As expected it appeared again. I decided to move it to the other end of the garden, instead of throwing it, and again it had moved the next day. I eventually became bored with trying to move the ball and I left it. It stayed there for a few days before disappearing on it's own, and it's never come back. My mum was quite happy about that :D

That's all I can remember right now, but I think I've missed a few. I've also had many strange dreams, are dreams at all related to ghosts? There's one thing I would like to write about but I'm not sure if this web site is the right place.

Pet Psychic,"Alaska, United States",Psychic / Medium,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Psychic / Medium :: Pet Psychic

I have a friend who sometimes sees the spirits of dead pets. Her brother sometimes sees the spirits of animals. For instance, when her brother was two or three, their family was at a cabin. A man had shot himself recently and he had had a swinget in his yard. My friend's brother had been swinging on it (his mom was watching him and my friend hadn't been born yet) and even though he could barely talk, he had suddenly said, ""Mommy, there's a man. There's a man, and (pause) he shot himself..."" Creepy, eh?

Once my friend had been laying on the couch and suddenly a dog had ran down the hall. She felt like it was protecting her. When it left, the feeling of protection went away and later, her mom told her the dog's name. Sometimes, she sees dogs, and when she describes them to her mom, her mom tells her their names, because they were dogs that she had owned. There were others that she told me, but I have forgotten them. However, even though she usually sees dead animals when she sees spirits, once she heard the cookie jar lid lifting up and she thought it was her brother stealing cookies. When she went in there, she saw her dead grandfather, who had loved cookies. She left a letter for him and it disappeared. I have no proof of any of these, but my friend swore that they are true. She is not the sort of person who would lie about things like this.

My Sister in Law's Haunted House,"Idaho, United States",Demons / Possessions / Exorcisms,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Demons / Possessions / Exorcisms :: My Sister in Law's Haunted House

I n 1988, my second wife and I were living in a house that I had bought from my brother and his wife. Her first husband had committed suicide by shooting himself in the master bedroom and she could not stand to live in the house. They had been renting it out, until they moved out of state and I bought it from them. Things went pretty good for a while, then we started having problems with his ghost.

Several times, my wife said that she saw a figure of a man standing in our bedroom in the middle of the night. Then we started having things moved around that we could not explain. If we put something down in the living room and were out of the room for a few minutes, when we came back, the object would be moved to a new table or it would be on the floor.

One night we were sitting in the living room watching TV and all of a sudden the TV in the basement came on at full volume. I went running down stairs to see if we had someone in our basement as my wife and I were the only ones living in the house. When I got downstairs I shut off the TV and I looked all over the basement but could find no one. This happened several more times and I finally unplugged the TV from the wall. I had only been back upstairs a few minutes and the TV came back on at full volume. I went back downstairs and I moved the TV to the middle of the room after I unplugged it again.

My wife was scared to death that this ghost was going to harm us and she wanted to sell the house and move somewhere else. I told her we would have my parents who were ministers come down and do an exorcism on the house and see if we could get rid of our unwanted guest. So I called my folks and explained what had been going on and that my wife wanted to move out and I asked them if they would come down and see if they could get our unwanted guest to leave. They said they would be right down.

My parents came to the house and they started praying in all the rooms and blessing each room with Holy Water. They moved from room to room until they had been in every room in the house and they also did the garage. We lived in the house for 6 more years and never had any more problems with our unwanted guest.

Then all of a sudden my wife started seeing black demons calling her to the dark side and I ended up putting her in the hospital as she was wanting to commit suicide. The doctor said she was paranoid, and a manic depressive and was having delusions. He kept her in the hospital over night on suicide watch and put her on medications. When she got home she got better each day and for a few months things were fine.

Then the real problems started, as she went off her medications and did not tell me. She thought she was well and did not need them any more. She would fly off the handle at the drop of a hat and throw things at me. She got upset with me because I did not get a box taken to the basement as fast as she wanted me to. As I walked out the front door and towards the gate going into the front yard, she threw a large mug of ice tea at me and it ticked my ear just before crashing into the iron gate post and shattered all over the driveway.

A few days later she got upset with me in the kitchen and she threw a cast iron skillet at me. I ducked and it went through the sheet rock. I repaired the hole and two days later as I was going to the basement, she yelled at me to wait and take something to the basement for her. I had already taken the first step down, she kicked me in back side and I fell down the stairs hitting the wall at the bottom real hard. I did not have any major injuries but I decided that this was the last straw.

I told her I was moving out until she went back on her medications and she started yelling at me in a MAN'S voice. It was then that I figured out that she had been possessed by our unwanted guest. She refused to have an exorcism done on her and we ended up getting a divorce. She tried killing her new boyfriend about a year later by shoving him out of the drivers door as he drove them down a road. She now lives by herself and refuses help from anyone. This was not the way I wanted our relationship to end but she would not let me help her.

She still lives in the house and I am sure that the unwanted guest is back or at least is still inside of her. She won't talk to me , so I really do not know for sure.

The Face at the Window,"New Jersey, United States",Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: The Face at the Window

T his is my second story on this site, hello to everyone, I am riya. This story took place when I was visiting my aunt alone in new jersey, USA. My aunt used to tell me stories, when I was little, that her house was a big haunted mansion. I used to get scared but I hadn't ever believed her. Until something actually happened to me!

The day I entered the house for the first time, everything felt weird! I felt as if someone was looking at me through the windows of the guest room. I used to get goose bumps, as I took baby steps toward the window on the wall. But as I opened it, I used to see a blonde girl running in the backyard. This continued until one day I went to my aunt and told her my experience. She said that 14 years ago, this house belonged to a young couple and their five year old girl. I asked her if the girl was blonde. At that, she took me to a closet in the attic, and showed me a photo of that family. And yes! The girl was blonde. I figured out that the girl I saw was the same as in the photo.

The next day at night, my window was opened. I saw a girl staring at me from the window, and it obviously was the blonde girl. But then, suddenly, I saw that her eyes were totally black (I mean that she didn't have the white part a person usually has) she started to come to me, and I totally freaked out! I realized she wasn't a good spirit, but a bad one, I started shouting for my aunt, and looked toward the door, and as I turned my face, I was just 1 cm away from the blonde girl's face! I started to back off and ran to my aunt's room, and guess what! My aunt was sound asleep, but that girl was lying down dead next to my aunt! I woke me aunt up and she also saw he girl dead, it was 5 am, suddenly the girl got up and says ""you're dead"" to me. I got really scared, but after that day, the girl never returned!

From that incident (I was 10 at that time) until now (now I'm 12), I believe in ghosts and spirits, demons, etc. But I still can't figure out why that girl told me that I was dead, when she didn't put her words into action until now!

PS: if anyone would like to comment or tell me their views about why she said those words, please go ahead, because I'm really confused even now.

Bed Shaking,"Texas, United States",Poltergeists / Physical Manifestations,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Poltergeists / Physical Manifestations :: Bed Shaking

I t all started when my grandmother came to our house to bless my sister's room before the new baby came home. She went in there, said a few prayers and came out. Weeks later, my sister had come home late from one of prayer meetings and had been reading certain prayers to say at the next meeting. As she was getting ready for bed, she laid down and started to pray, and when she got to this one prayer, the whole bed started to shake, so she tried to run out of the room but couldn't open the door and when she tried to get out through the window, it was locked (we have no windows that lock).

I could hear her scream for my parents and it felt like we couldn't get there fast enough. Finally she was able to run out of the room screaming. The next morning we called my grandmother back to see what she had done. My grandmother walked in, stayed for a few minutes and then came out, with a smile she said, ""no sta aqui"" which means it's not here. She never told us what she did and my sister until this day has not told us the prayer she was saying that started all this but, the room still gives me the creeps.

I couldn't tell you what it was but I know it's still there. I can feel the worst feeling of being watched and my room is always the coldest. If you would like to know more about what else happen in my house or in the room, please add a comment and I'll story tell for you, thanks.

Slamming Door,"Washington, United States",Poltergeists / Physical Manifestations,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Poltergeists / Physical Manifestations :: Slamming Door

T his isn't an extremely big deal but last night I had a couple things that seemed a little strange. First, when I was coming inside my house, I barely pushed the door shut, and it slammed, so I opened it and pushed it lightly again and it slammed again, I did this a couple more times, and then I asked my grandma to watch and when she looked, I pushed it lightly and it didn't shut, it barley moved like it normally does, but as soon as she went in the other room, I opened it, lightly pushed it and it slammed shut. I think there was an entity, possibly a little kid that was just trying to have some fun, I don't think it was harmfull at all.

Later that night, I was laying in my bed and right by my right ear, I heard an extremely loud pop... kinda like the poppers you get on 4th of july that you throw at the ground and they pop, only it was a lot louder and right by my head. I believe this was also a little kid. He seems really nice and just wants someone to play with. I believe a little boy used to live on that property, in my neighbors' house, and may have played where my house now is... It is a modular home, it did not used to be there. It was just farm land. Maybe he used to have a play house in that area?

She Didn't Believe Me,"North Carolina, United States",Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: She Didn't Believe Me

M y name is Cat, I'm 16, I've lived in this house for 6 years at first... nothing happened. After a few months our porch lights would break... and our lights indoors seemed not to last. I always saw dark shadows, and heard footsteps up and down the hall leading to my room. Nobody believed me.

A few years later, my sister Cara was cleaning out back porch. Our parents weren't home so the screen doors were locked. The screen doors had plastic over them to keep out the cold winds. Cara told me she saw a shadow fall over her and something started pulling shaking the door. She stands up scared, a shadow runs past the other door, she unlocks it and throws it open. If it had run past the corner of the house she would've seen it. It simply... dissapeared. She shook it off but told my father. My father not believing in Ghosts, told us to watch for strange people in the neighborhood. I swore to Cara it had to be the ghost, cara didn't believe me.

Not long after her bedroom door would open every night and she'd freak out crying, I think she was 14 or 15. Wwhen she turned 16, she and I traded rooms. I still have the same trouble, my door opens every night, whether or not it's locked.

I had a friend over last summer... we're laying on my bed and I'm reading a book outloud. I had told her my room was haunted previous to this and she didn't believe me, my door swings open and she grabs my arm and starts to cry saying ""your door just opened by itself!"" I said ""what you didn't believe me?"" she said ""NO!"".

About 6 months after this, her sister, my sister and I were in my room online. We had on web cam because my sister was talking to her friend Paul, all the sudden paul asks ""who's behind you"" they look behind them and there's nobody there, they glance at the web cam and in the web cam there's a shadow. They had time enough to look behind them and back at the web cam once more before the entire computer shut down. Cara and I had gotten into a huge fight about a guy she liked soon after. And we refused to talk. Well, we left her home alone as I was on my way to my boyfriend's house and she was getting ready for work, she called me crying saying ""Cat, the ghost won't leave me alone, it keeps calling you and every time I put the phone on speaker and set it down so I can do my make up, it turns off speaker"" I laughed and said ""Cara it's saying we need to talk"" she said ""well I don't like this I'm gone""

My mom had FINALLY had enough, she asked our neighbors if they knew anything about what was going on. It turned out our neighbors were having the same trouble. Our houses and the houses around us were once the same plot of land and there was a sawmill about 100 years ago. There was an accident and somebody died. But then... I found money... INSIDE my bed... And my grandpa used to always hide money EVERYWHERE, so I told my mom and she said ""it couldn't possibly be Dad... he never hid change... If you find dollar bills that are torn in half, you know it's dad hiding his drinking money"".

About a week later, we're going through some papers and find two torn dollar bills. Now whether it's my Grandpa simply stating that he cares. A stranger spirit who once worked this land... Or both... I don't know... All I know is... She didn't believe me.

Reflection in the Cabinet,"Florida, United States",Apparitions / Voices / Touches,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Apparitions / Voices / Touches :: Reflection in the Cabinet

A bout 4 years ago, I was watching this special news program about a little girl who had been killed while camping with her family. It was a case that had happened about 12 years ago, but I'm guessing the case had been brought back up. Some hours after it ended, it was about 10 at night and I was walking towards the dining room. In the dining room is an old China cabinet that my great grandmother gave to my parents. It has glass doors like every other China cabinet so usually whenever you walk past it, you could see your reflection. I have to say that what happened next was one of the scariest things that has ever happened to me. I was the only one in the dining room so I know for a fact what I saw was for real.

As I walked past the cabinet, I happened to look at my reflection, however, I wasn't the only one looking. Standing next to me in my reflection was a little girl that looked exactly like the little girl on the news program that was killed all those years before. She was very pale and had dark circles under her eyes. She just stood there with the saddest yet angriest look on someone's face you could ever see. It looked as if she had just a long white shirt on and no shoes or socks. I was so scared that I couldn't even move a muscle. It felt as if I had been looking at her for an hour.

When I could finally got a hold of myself, I went running to find my parents. I was crying so hard I could barely get a word out. I began to feel sick like I was going to pass out and it got to the point where I couldn't even say what happened anymore because it had scared me so much. I usually don't tell people the things I see because most people wouldn't believe it. I can't imagine what pain that poor girl must be in even after all this time. I only hope that she found peace and can finally rest.

Attempted Possession,United Kingdom,Old Hags / Night Attacks / Sleep Paralysis,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Old Hags / Night Attacks / Sleep Paralysis :: Attempted Possession

I was dreaming and my dream became semi lucid. I could hear a girl singing her name to me ""Meena"". I was sitting at a desk with paper and pencil so I wrote ""hello meena my name is ***"" There was a spasm in my neck and shoulder, I was startled from sleep by this involuntary action, my mouth was shuddering open and closed while my breathing, which was not under my control, was forcing a slobbering sound out of me. I dismissed this effect with an act of will.

I could hear her singing only in my mind, she sang my name and I could sense something trying to touch my face and neck. I ordered her to go and heard screaming and wailing, this to was in the mind only. She was pleading with me ""yes, yes"" but I ordered ""no, no, go away"". The temperature dropped incredibly with every utterance of the word no.

I saw images of her, brunette and very young. What was jarring was that she was rotted on one side of her face and body which seemed to upset her gravely. I simply ordered her to leave being careful to offer no comfort.

I have had things approach me while sleeping before, the worst are more insidious and attempt to control the body, all can be dismissed with conscious effort. This girl was easier to shrug off than most although no others have caused a spasm, more like attempted paralysis.

It's Gonna Get Us,"Texas, United States",Apparitions / Voices / Touches,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Apparitions / Voices / Touches :: It's Gonna Get Us

I t was late at night, I can't remember the exact time, but roughly around ten o' clock. My mother was sitting at the table making a sandwich and I was on the living room floor watching t.v. And my middle sister brenda was in the shower. All of the sudden, my mom looks up and says ""why did you try to scare me?"" I looked at her and said ""who tried to scare you?"" And she said ""brenda come out from behind the door I already saw you"". I told my mom ""brenda is still in the shower there's nobody there"". She got up yelling for her to come out from behind the door and when she walked over there, there was no one there. She sat down and said I don't believe it. Now I am sitting there freaking out because I know I didn't see her there and my mom is starting to pray. My sister finally get out of the shower and says ""you look like something scared you?"" Just then, there was the loudest bang you could ever hear in your life on our back door.

I jumped out of my bed and ran to my mom's room with my sister as she followed. We sat there and waited and out of nowhere we could hear the back door open slowly with the creeks and all the other scary noises you could think of. I told my mom ""it's in the house"" she kept saying ""no, it's nothing don't worry"". My sister and I started to pray and hoped our dad would get home soon. After what seemed like hours, the door slammed shut and we could hear running around the house. We waited in the room until my dad got home.

Around 1 a.m. he finally got home and we told him all about it, he laughed at us and called us chickens, which we were. He went out with a rubber exhaust hose and walked around the house for a long time and when he came back in he said he couldn't see anything, no foot prints or tracks of any kind.

Till this day, I tell this story to my friends and family and every time I say it, I get chills, teary eyed and just plain scared. But my mom never forgets the day it almost got us. We could never figure out what was running around the house or what opened the door.

Room 314 at the Ateneo de Manila University,Philippines,Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: Room 314 at the Ateneo de Manila University

W hen I was in college, I went to a university in the Philippines called Ateneo de Manila University. The university was ran by Jesuit priests and was fairly new when you compare it the Ivy League schools in the USA. The land where the university now stood was apparently either a prison camp or a war hospital during the Japanese occupation of the Philippines back in World War two. Now that fact may or may not have anything to do with my story. I only know what me and my roommates experienced.

It was summer and I was dorming in Cervini Hall with three other girls - Michelle, Kat and a girl who didn't really attend the university but was just their for summer classes and therefore I can't remember her name. For the sake of the story, I will call her SummerGirl.

Michelle, Kat and I knew each other pretty well after having lived in the same dorm for the past few terms. We usually lived in Eliazo Hall the girls dorm but during the summers, we had to make do with living in the third floor of the boys dorm. This is how ended up in Room 314.

From, the beginning, there were some strange occurrences in Room 314. It wasn't really any big deal in the beginning. It was just things like door locking themselves, hair standing on end in the middle of the night over nothing. Stuff like that.

But there were two occurrences that really marked our summer experience that year. The first one involved Michelle. Her bed was by the door. And the wall of the door had wooden window jalousies. The jalousies at the bottom half would not close. One night while Michelle was studying French, she suddenly bolted out of her study desk and ran outside. Kat and I looked at each other in surprise when she did this. Upon her return, we asked her what made her bolt like that. According to Michelle the reason that she did was that while staring off into space while studying, she had seen someone through the open jalousies walking very slowly in a long white nightgown. The pace of the person's walk as well as the what she (Michelle referred to her as a she) was wearing made her curious and that's why she ran out. Kat and I asked her then what she found outside. Michelle replied that there was no one outside. But she was sure she had seen that person in a white nightgown walking slowly.

She even went next door, she said, because at the rate the person was walking she would have just been next door - but when she opened the door to the next room, no one there was wearing a white nightgown. We never did find out what that thing was, but I remember Kat, Michelle and I praying that night for the unrestful souls.

The second incident in room 314 was even scarier. This time it involved me and Michelle. One night, I was experimenting with my new curling iron. I had a mirror positioned on my desk and I was curling my hair. From behind me through the mirror, I could see NewGirl sitting on her chair in front of her desk studying or reading at least. Kat was on her bed next to New Girl's bed Michelle was again across me sitting by her desk studying.

As I curled my hair, I could see NewGirl from her back in my mirror. A few moments on, I thought I heard her crying as well as reading a letter or something like that. The thought should I approach her and comfort her crossed my mind, but then I thought, I shouldn't be so nosy after all, I didn't know her at all. So that decided, I continued curling my hair and eventually got tired of doing so and started to straighten my hair again. She was still crying then. As I turned around to talk to Michelle, I suddenly glimpsed NewGirl sleeping on the bed next to Kat's. In the split second that I've seen her through my mirror crying and reading, there was no way that she could have gotten to the bed from the chair that fast. I suddenly realized that the person that I've been seeing in the mirror was not NewGirl. I glanced at Michelle and she told me, I saw her too! I jumped from my bed and Michelle and I ended up sleeping in the same bed that night.

When Kat saw us lying in the same bed the next day she asked what happened. And we told her. She said that NewGirl had gone to sleep the same time as her. I was curling my hair and seeing that girl in the mirror for a good 20 minutes. And all that time, it wasn't her.

From that time on, we resolved to pray for the restless souls in our midst before going to bed at night. I think we helped them, because we had an uneventful rest of the summer in Rm.314.

Scared of a 10 Year Old Girl,United Kingdom,Apparitions / Voices / Touches,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Apparitions / Voices / Touches :: Scared of a 10 Year Old Girl

I t was somewhere around 9:00pm in april when I went to sleep normally. I was in my normal room and I have never encountered anything like I did until that day. When I closed my eyes, all of a sudden my body went colder and colder, I opened my eyes and looked all around my room for open windows, doors, or anything that let in cold air, everything was closed so I got a little freaked out.

I turned on my side to see a girl, about 10 years old, looking at me smiling, I thought I was dreaming so I shut my eyes tight and opened them again, the little girl was wearing a lovely white dress with purple flowers around her neck. At this point I was sweating, I asked the little girl who she was and she came closer to me and said ""I am your friend, remember? I used to live with you..."" she then giggled at vanished I had NEVER been so scared in my life. Was this girl someone I new in another life or something? I ran downstairs to give my mum a hug, I told her all about what happened, she thought I was crazy and it was just a nightmare but I knew it was real because I couldn't go to sleep because of the coldness.

No one would believe me so I turned to the internet looking for similar stories. So scary.

Ghostly Fight Guest,"Massachusetts, United States",Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: Ghostly Fight Guest

D uring the evening hours of November 9th, 1996, I was over my cousin's place to watch the Tyson-Holyfield fight on PPV. We were going to sleep on the reclining chairs after the fight, so we were going to be out in the living room all night. After the fight got over, we were all tired, so we decided to go to sleep. I was only 11 at the time, so 1:00 in the morning was VERY early for me.

Between 2:30 and 3:00 in the morning, I heard the toilet flush. I didn't really think anything of it, considering the fact that a) my uncle is a plumber, b) it was either my brother or 1 of my 2 cousins, and c) the bathroom is right next to my uncle's bedroom, so I thought it was either him or someone in my family. Thinking nothing of it, I tried going back to sleep, but me and my 11-year-old self, I had to use the can almost right after hearing the water run for a minute.

When I sat up, I saw (Scouts Honor) a person standing about 10 feet away from me. I just stood there, not making a sound, unable to move, and basically, scared shiatless! EVERYTHING was visible: the face, beard, hands, hell, even a watch he was wearing could be seen. He looked at me for about 6 seconds and walked to his left and down a spiral-staircase into my uncle's basement, where his brother-in-law and sister were living. Needless to say, the bathroom wasn't exactly needed after that experience hahaha.

The next morning, we all woke up and I asked my uncle about the ghost and if he had seen it before. He never noticed anything, nor did my cousin's. I tried telling my mother and father about it, but they thought I had watched a Friday the 13th movie or something like that and thought it as a nightmare.

A few weeks later, my uncle had put his house up for sale. He had a whole history of the house printed up by the Real Estate office that had sold him the house, the office that was selling the house did one as well, hell, he even had any police reports of that house done as well. Turns out, back in the 80's, a man had accidentally killed himself when he tripped down the spiral staircase.

It took my uncle almost a year and a half to sell his house, but in the meantime, he and his wife had seen the ghost I was talking about.

They got so scared, they took their 1 year old son away from there in fear the ghost might be dangerous. Nothing physically violent ever happened with anyone in that house by the ghost. A priest came by and blessed the house, and the ghost was seen only a few more times since then.

As a joke nowadays, whenever I go by my uncle's new place, I always have a bible with me, just as an incase hahaha.

Pushed in Between,Canada,Old Hags / Night Attacks / Sleep Paralysis,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Old Hags / Night Attacks / Sleep Paralysis :: Pushed in Between

I was about 7 or 8 when this happened, but I still can remember it very well. I had moved to Montreal with my parents and we moved into this apartment that seemed quite odd frankly. My mom told me she had seen it before and that things happened in it. She told me some people were killed. She said she'd seen it 2-3 years ago though, so I was beginning to be a little freaked out since I had no idea how she could have seen it before if we never went there before. I believed her though. I always felt awkward in there from the moment she told me that.

One night, I was about to go to bed and I had this strange feeling. I stayed up for an hour before falling asleep and when I did, I had a dream that something picked me up and flew me up and then suddenly I was dropped and I was falling slowly for what seemed a long time, then I was thrown down hardly. It was actually about 10 seconds. I fell on my back hardly and heard it crack. I woke up and I knew I didn't fall by myself because, logically, I would have fallen in less time since my bed wasn't too high and it was in between another bed.

My parents woke up right away because they heard a loud noise. I was crying and crying. It hurt really badly. It's as if someone would have thrown me in between the two beds. Right after I had fallen, I already had bruises on my back. My whole back was blue all over only a bit after. I ever had a few scratches, I had no idea how I got them though. Those bruises and scratches were there for a long time but they went away eventually. Some people might tell me that I probably fell by myself but it was impossible. You'd have to experience it to know what I mean. We stayed there for only 6 months, my mom wasn't able to live there. She'd had things happen, actually we all did. We couldn't stay there anymore. Also, If anyone could explain to me what it was, please tell me. I was thinking it was probably a demon but it seemed to me that there was more than one of them.

We're usually really unlucky and we pick out the worst places to move to, lol. I hope you enjoyed reading. I really want to know what it wanted from us though.

My Doll Friend,Canada,Poltergeists / Physical Manifestations,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Poltergeists / Physical Manifestations :: My Doll Friend

I got a doll at the age of 6, it was from a garage sale. I didn't know who it belonged to or anything. I only knew that I loved it from the first time I got it. I always carried it everywhere with me. One day, I wished it would come to life and be my friend for real. That doll was like my only possession, I always had her with me and I never let go of her.

That night I fell asleep wishing that and the next day when I woke up I noticed that my doll wasn't beside me anymore, usually I would sleep beside it every night. I thought it was my mom or dad that put it away or something, so I looked for her and found her in my toy box. I then went on to play with her and since it was only the morning and I was still tired, I went into bed and laid her beside me. I covered myself with a cover and covered her with the same one, I pulled her close and then I closed my eyes. I felt something touching my leg and moving up and down as if it was rubbing it. I looked at my doll and her head was turned to me. Of course, that was because I left her that way. So I still felt something touching me and I pulled my covers off and screamed. MY DOLL'S LEG WAS MOVING ON MINE! I screamed at the top of my lungs and my parents both woke up and rushed to my room.

I told them what happened and they never believed me. You probably won't but I know what I experienced and I'll never forget it. I still have the doll in a box somewhere. I keep it as a memory.

The Good and the Bad,Canada,Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: The Good and the Bad

T his happened into my last apartment. I just moved to a new one yesterday, let's hope this one isn't haunted because like all the one's I've been. I'm really unlucky when it comes to this. This is a few things that have happened to me and my mom.

First of all, the first time I came into it, I felt awkward. It felt as if it wasn't safe. I told my dad right away 'I don't feel good here, I don't want to live here'. He didn't listen though. Right now in my new one, I didn't protest, it felt so safe. It's the first time I've felt this safe in ages! Back to the other apartment. I'll start off with my mom's experiences.

My mom felt the same way as I did about this new place. Only little things would happen at first but then they grew bigger. Like one night, my mom told me that she fell asleep and she woke up at about 3:00 to 4:00 am. She said she saw some woman with black hair and pale skin. My mom didn't know her and she said a prayer right away. The woman vanished into flames. I believed my mom and I believe it was possible because my mom doesn't lie and she doesn't have mental issues. She didn't want to scare me so she didn't tell me up until one night I told her about my dream.

I had dreamt that in the room beside me, there were spirits wandering, lots of them. They were all different colors. I didn't think it was anything but I still told her and then she told me about that and the other things.

She told me that twice, two nights in a row, she felt something heavy on her back as if it was pulling her down so she couldn't move, she'd wake up at about 3:00am and she couldn't move but then she'd fall asleep a few minutes later. I found that weird because I was having troubles in the night too.

I dreamt of a little boy that lived here in the apartment., I remember his face and everything but his name. In my dream, he was playful and nice. He wanted to show me something and wanted to drag me around to show it to me but it was as if it was real and he was tugging me for real. I felt it. For a second I opened my eyes and saw something floating, I closed them back right away because it was as if I was still sleeping but I wasn't. I can't explain it. There's no words to.

Also, once again in my bed. This part might sound a bit weird but YES IT WAS REAL! I was sleeping and I had no idea why but I was dreaming of going down a slide and the slide was curved up and when you would slide, you would turn upside down. I felt turned upside down for a moment and put back to place. I was also feeling like being choked since when something turned me upside down I felt my neck was bended and I couldn't really breathe. I have no idea what that spirit would want from me because a year before, in the same apartment, someone put a cover on me and I was dreaming that I couldn't breathe, which of course I couldn't do. In my dream it was telling me to wake up. And before I could choke, I woke up at the right time, I exhaled and inhaled really hard. I couldn't breathe at all. Well, I'm thinking there were 2 spirits here. A bad one and a good one.

We'd had the T.V turn on and off by itself and also the lights flickered sometimes. One memorable time was when my friend was over at my house and the light bulb exploded right in front of us. The glass was all over the place. There was nothing wrong with the electricity but there sure was something wrong with this apartment.

I also heard bells at 1am each time. You couldn't really hear them well, you could only hear them if you listened carefully. They were really soft. I told my parents about that, but they said they haven't heard anything and once I heard them and my mom was there and I told her ""Do you hear the bells?"". She shook her head. I was kind of scared.

That's it. Some parts of it are weird, I know but they're real. Think of it how you want, I know what I experienced. Thanks for reading. Give me your feedback. If you can, please try and explain some of this to me because I don't get it at all!

A Painful Death,Canada,Psychic / Medium,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Psychic / Medium :: A Painful Death

I have some freaky dreams about spirits sometimes. Some might have tried telling me something but I really don't know. Well, one was about some man that never seemed to have rested in peace because they had killed their own father somewhere by the railroad a few years back. It's as if I was that person and I had a flashback and I was reliving that moment where I stabbed my own father (The spirit's father). God, it felt so disgusting and so real. It's as if I would have planted a knife for real into the person's heart and slowly pulled it out to replant it into their chest. It felt so gross, it was real to me. I remember one name but I don't know if it's the father's name or the man's name. I know the name was said about 4 or 5 times repeatedly before I woke up so I couldn't have forgotten it. That dream took place by the railroad where the train would pass and years back. I had no idea who that person was but I knew I saw their face but I can't clearly remember it but I remember a few details. When I woke up, I woke up in sweat, it felt so real.

I'm going to try and do some research and see if that person truly lived here and who it was. I know it was someone, I could have never made them up or the situation up. I'll inform you guys about this after I see some phone books and after I search google a bit. I knew it was someone.

Mysterious Events at Birthday Party,Australia,Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: Mysterious Events at Birthday Party

I t was about a year since the death of my father's friend (who had only lived down the street from us) and since after his death, weird things had happened around the house like:

But the weirdest events happened on my birthday. All morning I had been feeling sick for no reason until my friends came around (for a sleep over). Nothing specifically bad happened after that until around night. After me and my 6 friends were full of sugar, one of my friends (sarah) saw something and got freaked out. She said she sensed something around the tent we were sitting in. I got a bit sick in the stomach again so I went outside the tent to our camp fire (which my father set up). But as soon as I got back in one of the two tents, sarah started telling us that she was getting freaked, some of my other friends sensed something too before sarah was but only just admitted it.

So, this leaded us to making a pact, nobody would leave the tent without somebody else. My other friends Shannon and Katrina thought it was weird but they went along with it. We were about to go to bed when mysteriously the tent wouldn't close so everybody went crazy and ran to other tent leaving behind phones, blankets, pillows, etc. Everybody was too afraid to go back for them. Another problem came to hand when the tent window was open, but being chickens everybody stayed inside the tent. Not knowing it, the weirdest part of my birthday was about to take place when, staring wide-eyed out the window I saw a white, cloudy and transparent form of a man holding an screw driver (or an other object, couldn't tell). The man shifted quickly across the window. Of course since my friends were scared enough, I didn't tell them but as soon as I heard my mother checking up on us, me and 3 of my friends ran quickly up the stairs to my bedroom. In the morning I told my friends what I saw, they believed me because they felt the ghost's presence, but they NEVER have came over for a sleep over SINCE!

I'm just so glad that we chose not to watch that horror movie before the events took place. Since after my birthday one of my other friends (emily) told whilst sleeping in my room she heard big, large footsteps down the hallway, she told me ""I'm glad you closed your door, if I saw that GOD DAMN ghost down your hallway I would have never slept again!""

Some other events have occurred after my birthday, these are:

PS: this is not the only ghost my family have encountered before!

Bathroom,"Alaska, United States",Misc,"L ast year I was at my mom's cousins house cleaning with my cousin and my sister. My cousin and I were in the bathroom cleaning. But I had to go to the bathroom. There was a trash can under the counter... and as I walked by it, the lid of the trash can opened. But I knew it wasn't me because I didn't step on it. It would have been hard for me to step on it if it's under the counter... That day we heard other sounds. We would come up the stairs after we went downstairs to clean her room. And when we came up the stairs, someone was stomping behind us. It wasn't either of us. Because we don't stomp when we run upstairs except when I'm mad.

Then this other time, I was with my friend Lauren. We were outside jumping on her trampoline. We kept looking out into the woods because we would see stuff. And we kept hearing twigs breaking. So we would look over there and see this one face that reminded us of the girl from the Ring. We went a got a closer look but it wasn't there when we got over there. We didn't know what was happening.

This other time, my friends Lauren, Jordyn, Hannah, and I were playing the Ouija Board and we lit candles around us. We called a spirit and the eye would move... So we would ask questions. We got a little scared and then the candle blew out. It was standing on the dresser so it couldn't have been any of us. We all ran out of the room.

Then we went back into the room again. These dolls were all normal before we left. When we went back, their heads were turned and there feet were like moved forward where it was like going to fall. And we all made sure no one was in there. So it couldn't have been any of us.

The Lady in the Mirror,Canada,Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: The Lady in the Mirror

I really think my house is haunted. Since we moved in three years ago, I have seen and heard many strange things. Doors opening when I know I closed them, misplaced makeup and picture frames that I was using only seconds before I lost them. I have even seen shadows of people when no one is home! My house is a big, old place, so a ghost might not be a crazy idea.

But my scariest experience was about a year and a half ago. I was in the sun room in my house reading in front of the fire, when I heard a noise behind me, coming from the kitchen. I got up just because I get kind of freaked out by some of the stuff going on in the house. Since no one was home, I thought it was the cat. But the cat was at the vets that day! I told myself it was just the house. Houses do make noises, so I just kept reading. Than I heard a bang and what I knew was a footstep. I looked up at the mirror to the kitchen and standing there was a woman I had never seen before! I jumped up and ran into the kitchen, thinking she was a robber but there was no one there! I looked all over the house and called my dad, but he told me I was crazy. He told me that I had imagined it.

To this day I still don't know if it was a ghost or my imagination, but it seemed so real at the time! If you have any thoughts, feel free to share them.

Phone Off the Hook,"Michigan, United States",Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: Phone Off the Hook

I 've lived in my house since I was about 5 or 6. It's a 2 story house with an attic and a basement. When I was little, my parents had a bedroom upstairs that was in the back of the house. It was big, with a walk-in-closet that's broke and stays open about an inch or 2 because it won't shut all the way. When the phone would ring, someone upstairs in my parents room would answer it. It would freak my mom out because when she went to answer the phone downstairs, a light on the phone would come on saying that someone else answered it. My family often found the phone in my parents room answered or sometimes the receiver would be off and sitting next the the base part of the phone. Back then, we had the phone with the cord. My parents just ignored it and finally they took the phone out of their room. Since then we haven't had any problems with the phone but we have with other things...

My parents moved out of the room and then I moved in with my sister. I was 7 or so and my sister was 6. We shared the room for a couple of years and then she moved out (we switched rooms a lot when I was little). When I was about 13, I moved back in to the back bedroom. After a while I started getting nervous in the room. I always felt something was there, watching me. My bed was right across from my closet, so when I went to bed. It's always a little open and it scared me. I started having horrible nightmares and the closet started opening on its own. I would go to bed with it closet and it the morning it would be wide open. Things started getting really creepy and I wouldn't go near the closet. I felt as if something evil was there. I told my parents about things that happened and they didn't believe me. Finally my sister switched rooms with me.

Well, the same thing started happening to her. She ended up moving out of that room to. I'm about to be seventeen and I still won't go in that room. My room is now the second on the right of the hall, which puts me by the room. The room was working but now it's not. I now sleep in my sister's room with her, which is the first room on the left of the hall.

My door opens and closes. You can hear walking around in the hall as well as bedroom doors slamming. In my room though, will get very cold out of the blue. You can hear people walking in the attic above my head. So much stuff happens and it creeps me out.

I used to have friends stay the night and they didn't end up staying. They all used to call home or just go home in the middle of the night because something scared them.

Mobile Ghost Happenings,"South Carolina, United States",Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: Mobile Ghost Happenings

I t all started around 6-7 years ago. I most likely was around the age of 8 or 9. At the time I lived in this mobile home park in South Carolina. I was sleeping one morning and suddenly woke up because I had a sense that something was watching me. When I was awake, I glanced around my room and suddenly saw this figure. I looked at her, she was really tall and looked like someone of a western movie. At the time, she didn't seem like she was going to hurt me but then she started moving towards me. She had this look on her face that I can't forget for some reason. It was a very seldom, calm look, but all at the same time evil. I became very frightened and I pulled my covers over my head. I could feel a pressure on the blanket and I prayed that when I looked out from my covers, nothing would be there. When I looked out of my covers about 15 minute later she wasn't there anymore.

I ran out of my room very quickly. After this incident, weird things still took place. Every night there would be this light on my door, always in the same shape (sort of a flower shape) but in different areas. It would stay on my door about the same time every night (from around 9-10:30ish) and this disappear. Nothing around my door would make this shape. My doorknob would also become really hot at sometimes, like that of fire in the room.

To this day I wonder about the occurrences at my house. It was a new mobile home, we were the first to live in it, so I can't think of why it would be haunted.

Strange Feeling,"Texas, United States",Apparitions / Voices / Touches,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Apparitions / Voices / Touches :: Strange Feeling

A s I am writing this story, I am currently house sitting for my brother. Yesterday, before I went to work, I was in the living room and had just turned off the television. When I turned the television off, I noticed a shadow going through a corner of the room. I saw the shadow as it was disappearing. I was the only person in the house at the time and my brother's dog was in its room sound asleep at the time. I know that the door to the living room was closed and that no one from the neighborhood was anywhere near the house. Also, earlier in the day, I was on the computer in the office and I felt as if some presence was standing at the door watching me.

The house that my brother lives in was built about three years ago and he is the first owner. Even as I am writing this story, it feels like something is watching me from my right and there is no one there. The dog is in another room right now, sleeping. I never had a feeling like this before at his house. I wrote a story about three black shadows at my bed. I am starting to wonder if any one of these ghosts have followed me over to my brother's house while I am house sitting for him.

Nothing else has ever happened at my brother's house before until the past couple of days. I also highly doubt that the area where the house is built could be haunted by anything, except for what could be following me.

Stevensville School District,"Montana, United States",Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: Stevensville School District

T here are several buildings in the district that I believe to be haunted. I had written a paper for a college course about two years ago. The most activity I have experienced has been in the Jr. High Building. That building was built in 1901. It is said that a young girl named Nelly killed herself there over a boy in 1920.

The building was first constructed as a training school, then became the high school, before being turned into the Jr. High. I have had a basket ball thrown down the stage steps at me in the dark, when turning on the lights. I have heard a young girl say, ""goodbye"". I recently heard a little girl hum in my left ear when hanging up the broom by the stage.

At christmas something pulled a banner off the door, when I was in the building alone. The tape was still intact, and shaped as if it were contorted to the door. I would have to say the most unusual experience was when I was vacuuming the band room. It was as if I had brushed my arm against a block of ice. That part of my arm was cold for quite a while afterward.

There is what I believe to be a male entity who walks on the tops of some of the buildings. He makes noises in different spots just so you know he is there. My son actually heard him walking once.

The Old Woman in a Nightgown,Denmark,Apparitions / Voices / Touches,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Apparitions / Voices / Touches :: The Old Woman in a Nightgown

A bout 6 or 7 years ago, I came out of our bathroom and I was not expecting what I saw. I had not been thinking of ghosts or anything scary earlier in the evening and I never believed in ghosts. I do now. I was sitting in the kitchen with my parents and brothers and I had to go to the toilet. When I walked out of the toilet, I saw a old woman standing right by the stairs and my bedroom. She wore a nightgown and curlers and she looked very pale. I was not that scared, because she seemed very calm. I think I was in shock. Suddenly she disappeared.

Then I went in my bedroom for the night and I looked everywhere to see if I could see her. She wasn't there and I went to bed. I fell asleep and when the clock turned 4, I woke up, sweaty and scared. I was in shock. I just fell asleep again, because I was thinking I was just scared because of what I had seen in the evening. I was wrong...

I never slept in that room alone again, because I always woke up at 4, sweaty and in shock. I slept in the guestroom and I never woke up there. I also heard noises from everywhere in the house, but I never told my father, because I thought it would sound silly.

Little Boy Ghost Wearing a Cape,"California, United States",Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: Little Boy Ghost Wearing a Cape

I just moved into my boyfriend's 4 bedroom house 2 months ago. I never felt anything strange, but one day I was cleaning up the kitchen and he was in the living room and I saw something from the corner of my eye run past where he was sitting towards another room. It seemed like it was a child wearing a white cape or towel like if they were playing. I asked him if he saw anything and he said no.

Then I would feel a presence every so often like coldness or something running by, I would always catch it from the side of my eye. He then told me that he would always see something in the hall ways and when he would turn around nothing. Last night (5/28) I was the only one awake in the house and I went to one of the bedrooms that we turned into an exercise room, I turned on the tv and left the room and as I was walking down the hall, I could see the light of the tv reflecting against the wall (I left the door was cracked open), right when I pushed the door open, the tv was turned off so I thought maybe something went out. I turned on the light and turned the tv back on and it was working fine. I noticed that the compartment that opens so you can change channels and the volume was open. I freaked out cause I know for a fact that I turned on the tv with the remote and the compartment I was speaking about was shut.

Earlier that day I was cleaning up that room so I know no body else was in there. I asked everyone that lives with me if they heard noises and they said they hear things but they don't bother because its not going to harm us. It still scares me cause I think someone is playing a joke on me when they aren't. Maybe someone has a similar experience?

11:11 PM Poltergeist Problems,"New York, United States",Misc,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Misc :: 11:11 PM Poltergeist Problems

I have never experienced a ghost in my life until last year. I'm only 14 now and I'll tell you, once I made a mistake. The presence of evil never leaves me when I'm alone at my house. My friend and I love to joke around when it comes to ghosts. He has an ouija board that worked for us. It didn't tell us much, except there are ghosts in my friend's house and there are 3: One regular, two poltergeists. They don't torment us, but when I spend the night, they like to show up as white figures around 2:00 AM. Enough about that though.

The thing that really hurt me was the one question: Do you know how I can summon spirits in my house? He told me he heard from somewhere (I can't remember) that you can bring a poltergeist easily by hanging a sheet of paper over your bed at night with three words written on it: Knife, blood, fear. Being as skeptical as I am, I tried it. That was mistake #1.

11:11 PM: I was waken by a loud scratching noise. I thought nothing of it and looked out the window to see the tree. It was still, no wind. It sounded like crumpling paper and deep breathing coming from right above me. Frozen in fear, I now had to think fast. I rushed to the door, despite my brother, and flicked on the lights. A black shadow in the shape of a torso and head, the rest blurred, was right over where I was sleeping. Scared, I cursed it and yelled for it to leave. I prayed as hard as I could to God to make it leave. I left the room and got some water.

After I shook it off, kind of, I went back upstairs. The lights flicked on and off four times. Then I heard a faint laugh and it was over. Now, every day for a year I will be woken up at 11:11pm with chills and I feel a great evil presence with me. I've learned my lesson now I want that thing out. It has also shown itself a couple of times over the year (last time being a week ago) in mirrors or the TV reflection.

I told my parents about this and they say I have an overactive imagination and need to settle down. I know one thing about this: I didn't think it up!

The Chimney Ghost,"New York, United States",Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: The Chimney Ghost

A bout 15 years ago, the guy living in my current house died. After 12 years, we moved in. People say he died from a heart attack but others say his wife killed him. But I ended up getting the room he died in. Every night I could hear beating in the chimney in the room and it would slowly move its way up right above my bed.

A week later I had my friend Megan spend the night to see if she could hear it to. Well she did, then I had my sister stay in there to see if she could hear it. About a week later, it was my birthday and we slept out in the tent. We could hear someone screaming so we went out to check it out. We didn't see anything outside so we went inside, we could hear footsteps up the stairs but we didn't see anybody. Then the door to my room opened. We went in there and we saw a shadow going into the chimney. We were wondering why he would go into the chimney and people say that his wife killed him and stuffed him in the chimney.

Every other night, I can hear the door bell ring but no one is there. So I would go back up to bed, then I could hear the door shut and hear the footsteps go up the stairs and into my room but this time I didn't see anybody.

So the next night, I put powder down to see if there were real footprints. The next morning I checked and there were footprints leading up to the chimney in the room. Everyday I wonder how I can stop him from coming back. The only way I can think of is to give him a proper burial. But the only problem is how do I get his body out of the chimney. That's the one thing I haven't figured out.

So if you people out there know how I can get his body out of there let me know I will really appreciate it.

Computer Glitch,"Arkansas, United States",Misc,"I must tell you that I've been away in Nashville, Arkansas (a very small town) for the holiday weekend and just returned. I was visiting my dad and my step mom (it was my first time to meet her because they wanted to get married quickly and swiftly so they did it without me there, I granted them the wish). I had a nice time and enjoyed meeting Elaine.

One strange thing happened on this trip this morning actually. It would've been at about 3:00 am and it is Tuesday the 29th. I had to get up that early for my plane out of Texarkana (an hour drive away, and this might could be explained away but it puzzles me), here is the deal:

I brought along my IBOOK computer with me on the trip. On Monday, I had all three of us go out to the backyard and take photos together. I quickly came in and downloaded them. One came out great with the three of us smiling. I kept it up on my computer for the rest of Monday, but my computer has that timed fade out where if you leave your screen on it will black out after a bit on its own.

The only way the screen can come back on is if someone or something contacts the fingerpad square (used for moving the cursor, you know?). Well, right before I went to bed at about 10:00 pm on Monday night, I walked to my computer and whisked my finger onto the pad so the screen popped back on and I could see the photo again before bed. The light illuminated the room as I went to the bed and got under the covers. In a matter of minutes, the screen blacked out as normal and the room was cast into darkness. I awake on my own just about a minute before my 3:00 alarm went off, to find the screen was on and the photo was up again illuminating the room and I immediately got a chill about it and thought... wait a minute, that shouldn't be on!

I hopped up to inspect and see if something was walking on it (an insect? If they walked across the pad could it turn on like that? Maybe I'd assume, right?) but I didn't see an insect. Then the screen went black again. I hopped into bed and the alarm went off and scared me and then I caught a glimpse at this figurine on the nightstand next to me that had been beside me for the whole time I visited but I never inspected it until that moment when the alarm went off and I got a bit of a chill... The figure was a girl that reminded me of the girl in my vision, right before leaving with angel wings and she was on her knees praying. It may not be anything, but one, the computer being on really caught me by surprise and two, it might just be a silly thing, but that angel girl figurine next to my bed reminded me of the vision.

Another weird thing that I learned on this trip is that Elaine, my step mom's only daughter, was born the same year as I was and she was killed in a car wreck sometime around prom or homecoming I believe. It's been about 10 years since she died.

With me leaving so early this morning... One, I didn't get to ask Elaine where that angel figurine came from and I wanted to (just ask her curiously but not telling her why I'm asking, I don't want to freak her out) and two, since I only just met her this trip and am getting to know her... It's not right for me to come out so immediately and ask about her daughter's death and if she has experienced any weird things since her daughter dying. I don't want to frighten Elaine or have her think I'm crazy. But I had many questions in my mind early this morning as I left.

My life has been feeling a bit different and odd since May 22nd and I don't want to be making stuff up in my head or over exaggerating or anything but things just feel a little off kilter.

These new developments might be absolutely nothing but I'm just taking notice, trying to notice details just in case something is going on around me.

My Childhood Ghost,Canada,Apparitions / Voices / Touches,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Apparitions / Voices / Touches :: My Childhood Ghost

M y story takes place in Manitoba, Nelson House. When I was younger, around the age of eight, I always felt as if something evil was following me. One day, when I was home alone (my family was next door for some birthday and I wanted to be home alone), I was washing the dishes and in the corner of my eyes I saw a face, the face belonged to a woman. Her face was moldy green with white (only white) eyes and long sharp white teeth. She had long and black hair that was straight. She was grinning madly (or evily I don't really know since I never got a good look at her) at me, then she went away a second after I saw her.

Thinking it was a joke I went down the hallway saying ""Who's there?"" I received no reply, So I went back to the kitchen and I heard a door open and close, And my room door slammed closed (since I never close it). I started to read books about ghosts and I 'became' a ghost hunter, along with some other friends of mine. And then it left me alone for a few years after that.

And once again I feel the evil, only it is further away and stronger than before. My ghost hunter club has broken up last year so I have no friends to help me this time. So I ask you readers: Does anyone know what's following me?

Music Attracting a Ghost,"California, United States",Apparitions / Voices / Touches,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Apparitions / Voices / Touches :: Music Attracting a Ghost

I have a drum set here in my house. I used to play everyday when I got home from school. When I played, I saw something in the corner of my eye. Sometimes it's just a blue thing but I recognized it to be a white figure. It's not like a full human sized, just like something peeking out from my door or behind my bed or something like that. I thought maybe it's just in my head until my friend Mauricio came over. He plays guitar but wanted to try out my drums so I let him.

After he was playing for about 10 seconds, he stopped. He then said ""Josh, what was that thing?"" I told him I didn't know what he was talking about and he described what I had seen. I told him that I used to see it when I played drums and thought it was just in my head and now I know it has to be something. It only came out when I played drums but I've seen it a few times playing my guitar or when I blasted music really really loud. My friend told me she thinks maybe it's that music was used to talk to spirits in rituals and stuff like that so that might be why it comes out when I played music.

Wall Knockers,"California, United States",Poltergeists / Physical Manifestations,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Poltergeists / Physical Manifestations :: Wall Knockers

M y girlfriend used to live in Mission Bay by the beach. That's in San Diego, in case you wanted to know. One night I was there, we were watching t.v. We kept hearing knocks on the wall and she thought it was some kids outside. I thought maybe it was a branch from a tree. It kept going on for a while so I decided to check it out. I went outside to see what it was, and there was a tree rubbing against the house. I went back inside to tell her it was just a tree and so we continued to watch t.v. We heard the knocks again, but this time it was on another wall. The only difference was that one side of the wall was in the living room (where we were) and the other side was in the kitchen. No one was there but us so we got kind of freaked out.

I told her it's a ghost just to try to scare her for fun. But the more I talked to her about it, the more I started to scare myself. And it finally hit me that it was probably a ghost. This continued for over 5 months. We got used to it and we weren't scared of it at all anymore.

One day we told it to stop and it did. I kind of regret telling it to stop because then the house just got boring like any other old house. Even though it was kind of scary, it was fun with those knockers around.

Screams,Australia,Apparitions / Voices / Touches,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Apparitions / Voices / Touches :: Screams

H ello, my name is Cocaracha! Something really strange happened to me one week ago! It was about 11:00pm and I was watching TV with my boyfriend, when suddenly I heard footsteps. I asked my boyfriend if he heard something and he said no, so I thought that it was only my imagination and ignored it.

But after 10 minutes I heard somebody screaming I was scared, I looked out of the window and I saw a girl with long black dress walking on the yard in my house! I said to my boyfriend that something is on our yard, but he looked outside the window and he saw nothing! My boyfriend told me to calm down and hugged me. I couldn't sleep all night. I was thinking only about the girl that I saw in my yard.

The next day, I asked my neighbors if they saw the girl that I saw and they said that 34 years ago, one 15 year-old girl died in fire. I told my boyfriend that I want to move in other house and because he loves me, he agreed with me. So now we are looking for a new house. I also told my mom what I saw and she said that probably it's just my imagination, but I know it wasn't. I clearly saw the girl in a black dress.

The day after this, it was 10:00pm and my boyfriend and me were kissing, when again I heard somebody screaming. I can't wait to move away from this house!

My Guardian Angel Is my Old Cat,United Kingdom,Pets / Animals,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Pets / Animals :: My Guardian Angel Is my Old Cat

W hen I was about nine, we had to get our cat Jess put down. He had this disease where he was losing all his white bloods cells which by the way help to fight sickness and heal wounds. He got it because he was bitten by another cat. We were all really sad and after we buried him, I wished I could see him one last time. Then a few months later, I was sleeping in my mum's room because dad was working overnight. My mum was asleep but I was wide awake. I heard a purr just like Jess coming from under the bed but I didn't dare look.

Two weeks later, I was down by the garden putting daises on Jess' grave. I finished and was walking back up when I heard a meaow. I glanced over my shoulder and there, walking after me, was Jess. I wasn't sure I saw right but when I looked back, he was gone.

A week later, my auntie came to our house with a new kitten. It had black and white fur and looked JUST LIKE JESS. It was like Jess had sent him down from heaven. I immediately burst into tears. I knew then and there that Jess was up in heaven looking after me! I am 13 now and my cat Sox looks even more like Jess than ever, except for being a little smaller.

I always get the feeling Jess is watching me. At least I got my wish and I feel like with Sox it will last forever!

Medium Experiences,"Virginia, United States",Psychic / Medium,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Psychic / Medium :: Medium Experiences

W hen I was little and I was in class, I felt like there was a ghost behind me watching every thing I was doing. It was weird, I tried to move but it was like he/she didn't want me to move so it lasted about 30 seconds and that feeling went away. Then when I sleep in my room, I sometimes wake up to scary sounds and it happens a lot now lately and I'm sick of it. It's like foot steps or talking. Then when I go to the woods behind my house to visit my dog who had died (he was hit by a car), I feel like someone is watching me (I live in the country). And there's a train track about an acre behind the woods and when I'm back there, I hear the train whistle even though no one else can. And the wind picks up, it gets colder... or is that just me?

Sometimes, every other week, I have dreams and it feels like they come true I don't remember the dreams, I remember bits and pieces, then when it comes true, I remember the dream. Will someone help me and tell me what's going on? Because I'm starting to get scared.

Is it true if you feel like a ghost is in the room and you're scared, it means that this ghost is mean and wants to kill you?

Grandfather Says Goodbye,"Florida, United States",Family / Friends Visits,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Family / Friends Visits :: Grandfather Says Goodbye

I was 12 when my grandfather passed away. For the next few months, me and my brother and sister would stay over with my grandmother once a week to keep her company. One night over there, I woke up in the middle of the night for no apparent reason. This is unusual for me, especially since the house was quiet and I had no bathroom needs. But since I was up and wide awake, I decided to use the bathroom anyway and then get something to drink.

On the way back from the kitchen, I distinctly heard the sound of steady breathing coming from the living room, which was pitch black and supposedly empty. A little freaked out, I told myself the sound was somehow echoing down from the bedrooms and went back down the hall.

As I passed my grandmother's room, I heard her snoring a bit - the sound was not her. I peeked in on the sibs; not them either. Somehow, I made myself go back down the hall to see what was going on.

The breathing continued, and it was definitely coming from the living room. I stopped at the doorway and realized that it was coming from the far corner; my grandfather's favorite recliner. Like I said, it was pitch dark in there so I couldn't see a thing, but I listened for a while and went back to bed feeling very peaceful.

There's no doubt in my mind that my abuelo was trying to let me know he was OK.

"The Shadow, the Lady, and the Head",Philippines,Apparitions / Voices / Touches,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Apparitions / Voices / Touches :: The Shadow, the Lady, and the Head

T he Shadow: One evening, I was reading a book in my bedroom when I felt something strange about the window. It seemed to be glowing. I took no notice of it because I thought it was just the streetlight shining through the screened window. After I finished reading the book, I turned off the lights and went to bed (9:00 pm). I tossed on the bed because I wasn't yet tired. Afterwards, drowsiness overtook me and I fell into a deep sleep. About half an hour later (10:00pm), I woke up and I didn't know why. I happened to look at the window and there, I saw a shadow! Tonnere de Brest! I couldn't believe my eyes so I put on my 300-degree glasses for a better look. I saw that it was clearly a shadow, maybe a boy's. I thought that it was someone trying to scare me. But nobody can reach the window of my room on the second story of our house. Minutes later, the shadow disappeared. I'M NOT KIDDING! THIS STORY IS REAL!

The Lady: This happened in Baguio when I was five years old. My parents and I went to Teacher's Camp in Baguio for our five-day Christian conference. A lot of our Protestant church's members went too. The leaders of our church had reserved about 30 cottages for the church members to stay in. Each cottage is enough for two or three families to stay in. My mom and I stayed with Timothy his mom, and his guardian in a cottage facing the woods. The distance between the cottage and the woods is about 255m or 1/4 km. The two are separated by a grassland. One evening, while my mom and Tim's mom were in the church, we were about to sleep but the noise of the rats in the untidy kitchen vexed us and we were very annoyed. In order to frighten and chase the rats away, I thought of jingling my bell on the porch. So I went out and did it. As I gazed on the woods ahead, I saw nothing but trees. But 5 minutes later, a white lady suddenly appeared among the trees! Mille sabords! I was so frightened that I immediately rushed into the cottage and bolted the door behind me. I can't forget that horrible experience. It was the experience in my life. I'M NOT KIDDING! THIS STORY IS TRUE!

The Head: Something bad happened when I was ten years old. Our relative's driver died because of the beastly leptos pirosis. My parents and I left our house to go to the funeral parlor to take a last look at the beloved driver. We arrived at a funeral parlor. It has two rooms at the sides for visitors looking at the bodies of their loved ones, and a broad staircase in the middle leading upstairs. As my dad inquired for the driver's coffin, I took a look at the top of the stairs only to stare at a ghastly floating head. I gave a shudder but didn't shout or scream. Afterwards, my dad told my mom and I that we arrived at the wrong place. We found it later when we asked for the direction from a bystander. After taking the last look at the driver, we went home. I'M NOT KIDDING! THIS IS TRUE!

Ghost at Oak Ridge Military Academy,"Texas, United States",Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: Ghost at Oak Ridge Military Academy

I used to live at oak ridge military academy in North Carolina, which was the site of a civil war battle, I experienced many supernatural events while attending the academy. One of the places that was haunted was a room in cone dorm. Many people had experienced the ghost that lived in that room, we would slide hangers under the door and they would all fly around and hit the door, then one day we slid a bible under the door and the next day we found it outside under the window... In shreds. Nobody has had the nerve to enter this room.

Another ghost was the one who haunted the middle room in the girls dorm, there were severe temperature drops and you could see your breath, and when no one was in the room it sounded like someone was bouncing in the old spring beds, and you could hear giggles that sounded like little girls playing.

Mercury in the Water,"Missouri, United States",Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: Mercury in the Water

T his occurred some time ago, but it is still very vivid in my mind of what happened that night. My fiance, our friend Ed and I were out joy riding around one night and it was pretty late. It was probably close to midnight. We were starting to get bored and my fiance James spoke up and said ""well what do you guys want to do?"". I couldn't think of anything and quite frankly I was getting a little tired and I wanted to go home. Our friend ED said ""why don't we take her to that house off of highway 36?"" I said ""what house?"" and James said ""you'll see"".

So he started driving in that direction and we came to this huge run down two story house. Immediately I felt uneasy and nausea. The house had no paint on it, the doors were gone and the windows were all busted out. There was a falling in barn on the far right of the house near the back yard and in the front yard there was a few trees, but one in particular was very big. In the back yard from what I could see there was just an old cellar. Also in the front yard, there was what looked like to be a falling in well.

I asked James what the story was on this house. He said that back in the 1900's there was a family that lived here, a husband and wife and their children (I can't remember how many children). I said ""ok so why did you guys bring me out here?"" and he said that when they lived here, somehow mercury got into their well water and caused them all to go insane. The man killed all of his children with an axe, hung his wife in the front yard on that really big tree I mentioned earlier and then shot himself in the front yard afterwards.

Now I do know that you can find this article in the newspaper in the library of my town so I know that there is truth to this. I said ok, I didn't really know what to expect at this point and then our truck died. Well, that didn't really scare me because vehicles do that sometimes when they set and idle for a few minutes. I was looking around and my eyes came to the side of the house near the back yard and I will swear to this. I saw a HUGE Dog, I know it was a dog because I could see the glint of reflected light on his eyes when he would turn his head and I could see his pink tongue moving in and out of his mouth as he panted. I could also see his ribcage as he was breathing. This dog was no ordinary dog. It was gigantic, I can't think of any breed of dog or animal that could be that big. I just stared and pointed, I was utterly speechless.

The guys looked at each other and looked at me and then the truck died again and would not start. Then from the corner of my eye, I saw movement, the guys saw it too because they turned their heads to look in the same direction I was looking in. There was someone walking through the house. And the weird part was that one minute this thing would be upstairs, where you could see it in the window, and the next minute it would be downstairs in the window.

I was very frightened by this point. I started feeling as if I couldn't breathe it was like pressure on my chest. I looked around the yard and thought I saw someone walking around, the guys saw it to but this was not a regular person, I do not think it was as if one moment it was a full figure and the next moment, you could almost see through him.

James was trying to start the truck and it finally did, we pulled out of the driveway and started for home. They won't admit it but they were just as scared as I was. When we got home, I started some bath water, I looked in the mirror and saw some thing on my chest there was a massive hand print! I called James in to look at it and said that he saw it too, I think that while we were at that house something was pushing on my chest that's why I couldn't breathe. I did see other things at that house that night but I do not know how to explain them.

I will however get a copy of that news paper article and post it up on this web site. But I need to know how I go about doing that. Whether or not what I saw that night was just all three of our imaginations or not the hand print was very real.

The Nice Boy and the Bad Man,"Texas, United States",Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: The Nice Boy and the Bad Man

I moved into a house in Harker Heights, when I first saw it, I loved all the mirrors that it had, even on the ceiling. When I first moved in, I didn't have any problems. It all started about three months after that. At this time, my son was only a year old. It started with this weird feeling like I was being watched. Then I started to hear what sounded like foot steps going from my kitchen tile floor to the carpet in my bed room. I would get up and nothing would be there and it was just me and my son at the house.

About a month after I first heard that, I was laying in my bed and it felt like someone got in the bed with me. I sat up and turned on the lights, nothing was there, well visible any ways. I thought I must have been dreaming and went back to bed. A few hours later I felt it curl up with me. It didn't give me a bad feeling like it was evil. At first I thought it could have been my dog Sheba that had passed a few years before that because it was curled up right behind my knees and she would do that. This would happen one or two times a week or anytime that it would storm. This continued for about six months.

After that, something else came, it was dark and gave me chills all over. I would walk into a room and it would get so cold. I could hear loud steps through the house. Then my son would start to cry and I would go in his room and he would be staring at the ceiling or would cover his head with the blanket and rock. I was on my way into his room one night when I heard what sounded like wings over the monitor and then he screamed so loud, I ran and got him, he looked so scared. After that he would not go into his room at night at all. He also would tell me some days where it was, he would say the mean thing is there and point to it. I could walk where he would tell me and there it would be cold. The doors would open and shut, my keys would disappear almost daily. I had my friend come and stay with me because I was afraid to be there by my self.

It got so bad that it would start to push us or pinch us, even my son. People used to say that I was crazy until I would invite them to my house and show them. The ghost or evil being was not shy, it would act up daily and with any one there. I went through and blessed the house, when I first lit the sage I felt it push me so hard, it almost knocked me down. I went through the whole house and it calmed down for a few days then came back.

After it came back, there was also another spirit there, this was a good spirit, I could go into a cold room and feel a warm breeze past by me. My son told me that it was a boy. I later got a picture of the little boy in the mirror in my room. Also when all of this was going on, my light bill went from $100 to well over $300 per month. I didn't stay there much after that. Also when the boy came, the city was doing construction right behind my house, on what was a wooded area. I think that he may have died there and was drawn to my house after that.

I know that my son still see things and now he is almost three years old and he can tell me more. We went past the old house and out of the blue he asked ""is the scary man still in there?"". We have been out since that and he will say that he sees people that aren't there or he asked me once if he could go play with the kids at the park but it was completely empty, I asked him what he saw and he described them in good detail to me.

Since then I have read up a lot on ghost and spirits and will not move into anywhere with all of those mirrors again. They are portals for spirits to come through. One thing that I should have done was to get rid of the mirror on my dress or before I moved, but I didn't know that then, sometime I will hear things but nothing bad has happened.

Didn't Stay to Play,Canada,Apparitions / Voices / Touches,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Apparitions / Voices / Touches :: Didn't Stay to Play

I have lived in many houses in my life, many which were haunted. When I was about 5 years old, I was in my room just sitting there playing with my toys. I had had my door blocked with stuffed animals so my brother could not get in. As I was sitting there playing with my toys, I looked up on my bed and I saw a young girl in her mid twenty's with long brown beautiful hair. She was very pretty but had harsh eyes and she was as clear as day, she didn't say anything, she just sat there and looked at me, and because I was young, I didn't know any better, I climbed up on my bed with my toys and asked this young girl to play with me. She didn't reply, she kind of just sat there watching me, so eventually I got frustrated and climbed back down on the floor and continued to play. A few minutes later, I looked on my bed and she was gone... But the animals that were blocking the only door to get in never moved.

I really payed no attention to this at all until I told the girls across the street about what had happened. They were shocked so they decided to investigate what was going on in my house using a ouija board, they figured out that this young girl had lived in the house many years before I did and was very happy in her home, she was a single mother and one day while her daughter was playing out front and she went missing from the front of the house and was never seen again. She told my friends that I had blue eyes and brown hair like her daughter and that she thought I was her daughter. I believe she is attached to something I own because sometimes I can still feel her presence. Friends and family believe I sort of have a 6th sense and I don't mind it at all.

In Bed with our 4 Year Old,"Arkansas, United States",Children Who See Spirits,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Children Who See Spirits :: In Bed with our 4 Year Old

W e lived at 1101 N. Main Street in the very small town town of Leola Ar. Our son had the small room right off of us. At first, small things happened like the stereo turning off, light going off and on and etc. Then one night, our 4 year old son was scared to go to bed. He said that there had been a little girl that had been crawling in bed with him. He said she would crawl in his bed and he would cover her up and the next morning she was always gone. He told us she never told him her name but when we asked him where she lived, he gave us directions to the cemetery.

We kind of passed it off as maybe an imaginary thing until after we moved, one of our cousins' coworker asked him who lived in that house (our cousins lived next door to the house.) He said that it was his cousins and the lady asked him if we had saw the little girl who lived in the attic. She said the little girl would appear to her kids and told them her name was chawka-chawka. She said she never saw the girl, but since my son saw her and her kids saw her then I'm pretty sure that she haunts the house and only appears to small kids.

One of the neighbors said that in the early 1930's, a log truck driver lived there and he had a small son. He said that back then the boys wore dresses too, and that when the dad left to go to work, he thought the boy went back in and he ran his son over and killed him. My husband also drove a log truck, so I don't know if that was a connection thing or what, but the other lady who lived there worked at a saw mill.

There are other things that happened in Leola too. A long time ago, there was a train, but it's gone now, and when I was a teenager I could hear the chugging of the train and the whistle. I've heard other stories too about Leola.  It's about 6 miles from Jenkins Ferry, where part of the civil war took place.

The Ghost that Touched Me,"California, United States",Apparitions / Voices / Touches,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Apparitions / Voices / Touches :: The Ghost that Touched Me

I started staying the night over at my girlfriend's house when we were just friends. The first time was a few years ago, when we were both freshmen in high school. Since we were just friends, she set up some blankets and a pillow on a futon on the ground for me to sleep on.

That night after we had gone to bed, I woke up in the middle of the night, because sometimes I just do. Usually, I just go back to bed but this time it was different. As I was laying there about to fall asleep, I felt something push down on the futon next to me. I thought it was one of her cats so I didn't mind it. Then I felt it brush up against my hair. It almost felt like a hand petting me so I freaked out and jumped up and turned on the lights. There was nothing there. I checked her whole room for the cats or her dog but they weren't there and her door was closed. I left the light on the rest of the night because I was afraid. I was considering waking her up, but I didn't want to bother her.

That was the first time I ever spent the night at that house and the first time I ever experienced anything there. That didn't stop me from spending the night again, though. And there have been plenty of other experiences also. Read my other stories if you want to find out.

Cold Gust of Wind,"California, United States",Misc,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Misc :: Cold Gust of Wind

W hen I was younger, I used to share a bunk bed with my brother. I had the top bunk and he had the bottom bunk. Right next to my bed was a shelf that was attached to the wall. I tied a toy to a piece of yarn and attached it to the shelf so it dangled. I don't know why I did that, probably because it was something to do, but whatever.

Well one night, I woke up in the middle of the night. I just laid there in bed with my eyes closed trying to go back to sleep. All of a sudden I felt a really cold gust of wind hit me. I turned on my lamp which was on a dresser by the bed and looked at the window. It was closed all the way and so was my door. Then I noticed that the toy I had dangling from my shelf was moving from the wind that hit it. I thought it was my imagination but then remembered about the toy. It was really weird because there's no way to explain it. How could wind blow into my room when the window was closed?

I still live in this house and through the years, plenty of things have happened. Some, I recognize as being in my mind, but others I can't even explain. I always try to find a logical explanation for things first so believe me, when I tell you something strange happened, something strange really happened.

Pulling the Sheets,"California, United States",Poltergeists / Physical Manifestations,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Poltergeists / Physical Manifestations :: Pulling the Sheets

T his is another story that took place at my girlfriend's old house . At the time we were still friends, just to let you know.

One night, I was over at her house. We were sitting on her bed listening to music and talking. After a little bit of talking, I felt the bed comforter move a bit. I thought she tugged on it and didn't think anything of it. Then it was being pulled harder. We were sitting next to each other and neither of us were doing anything except sitting with our hands in plain view of each other, so I knew it wasn't her. Then the comforter was being pulled from under us to the end of the bed. I got scared and moved to the back of her bed, and so did she. I was thinking it might be her cat or something, but remembered her door was shut and there were no animals in the room.

She was so scared that she jumped into my arms and hugged me really tight. I knew she wasn't playing a trick on me and that she was really scared. The pulling of the comforter stopped and she eventually fell asleep. I was really paranoid though and I stayed sitting there for an hour just staring. It's kind of funny now that I look back and think about it, but it was real. There's nothing I can think of that can explain it except some sort of ghost.

I've heard of a story like this once and thought it was just some joke but now that I've actually experienced it, I know it's possible for stuff like this to happen.

My Kitchen is Haunted!,"Oklahoma, United States",Poltergeists / Physical Manifestations,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Poltergeists / Physical Manifestations :: My Kitchen is Haunted!

I am 11 and I think I have a ghost in my kitchen. I have some stories and my sister told me one. Also I think there is a ghost in my room or the ghost traveled to my room.

I was laying in my living room watching T.V. All of a sudden I heard a cabinet close and vitamins shuffle. I sat in the recliner and looked where my mom was sitting and she was still there. I just sat there frozen wondering who or what did it was. It was around 11:00 or 12:00 at night. I thought it could have been my dad or my sister. I was sitting there for about 20 minutes. Nobody walked by (my kitchen and living room are connected, so is my hallway). Finally I got the nerve to run into my sister's room and when I got there, I saw her sitting at her computer. I looked out the door and found my dad fast asleep. I had a dog and hamster at the time but my hamster was in my room and my dog was laying in the recliner with me. I asked my sister if she went in the kitchen and she said no.

I was going in the kitchen and I opened the fridge door and I had a sense of someone watching me and I got cold at the same time. I quickly looked to see if anyone was in there. I saw nobody, so I grabbed what I needed and ran into my parents room. I told them what happened and they said that nothing happened in our house yet again and then I just went to my room and got on my computer.

I was sitting in the kitchen on the computer and I was looking at comics. My grandma that lived in a different part of Oklahoma was sitting in the living room with my mom. My sister was at a friend's house, and my grandpa and dad were out shopping at Best Buy (my grandpa is waiting for a liver transplant). All of a sudden, I hear a beep noise and the sound of a microwave. I look behind me and the microwave is on! May I remind you that the only other living things in my house are in the living room and in my parents room (my hamster had to move out). I ran into the living room shaking all over. I sat there for a minute and finally got the nerves to go turn it off. I walked in there and when I went next to the microwave, I felt a freeze. I clicked the off button and ran back into the living room. I told my grandma and mom what happened and they told me AGAIN that there was no ghost in our house. I just sat there and watched T.V. with them the rest of that day.

This story is what my sister and cousin told me (my grandparents are still waiting for my grandpa's liver, but they moved into some temporary apartments). They were watching a movie and all of a sudden they hear some sort of tap on the window in my kitchen. They grabbed my dog and ran outside and into my sister's car. They decided to leave my dog there and then they left to go to their boyfriend's house.

Also, one time I was in my room and I felt the presence of someone else in my room beside me. I looked and saw nobody. This has happened many times before.

My parents are the second people to own this home and nobody has died here. So, what I am thinking is that my house was built on Indian burial grounds.

The Woman on the Slopes,"Ohio, United States",Apparitions / Voices / Touches,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Apparitions / Voices / Touches :: The Woman on the Slopes

T his story took place on April of 2005. My friend Lisa and I where on the way to her house to take her home. She was telling me about the legend of the woman on the slopes. The legend is that if you drive to the bottom of the slopes at night, you'll see a woman in all white walking in the field. And if you have a ring on, you'll feel a tug on it. The story is that this woman was proposed to at this spot. It was the lover's meeting place. Shortly after the engagement her fiance was killed. The woman is still waiting for him to return.

So we get the gumption to go down there to see if it is true. We cruise down there in my little s10 at around 8:00pm. When we got to the entrance of the slopes, I parked there and shut off my head lights, but I keep the engine running. I wanted to shut the engine off and Lisa said ""no, just in case she came out, we can take off..."" So we are sitting down there for about 5 minutes laughing and jamming to my mix cd. It was playing ""Last Dance with Mary Jane"".

It seemed like as soon as that song came on, we saw something white in the distance but wasn't sure what it was. It seemed to be moving closer at a rapid pace. As it got closer, it seemed to be a woman. She was about 10 feet from us when we saw the angry look on her face. So Lisa and I were not planning to stick around to se why she was mad. I put the truck in reverse and started backing up and she was chasing us. I was going about 10 mph backwards and she was keeping up. I decided to not try to turn around backwards since she was on our tail. I ended up backing halfway up that road (which had some nasty bends in it). We got the truck turned around and headed to Lisa's house. We could still see her in the mirror until we got on the main street in Smithfield.

I got Lisa home and nothing else happened that night. I feel bad that we didn't find out what she wanted but one day I hope to.

Followed by Evil,Canada,Demons / Possessions / Exorcisms,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Demons / Possessions / Exorcisms :: Followed by Evil

T his story happened a few years ago. I was in fourth grade at that time and only 10 years old. I had always had an interest in magic, ghosts and the unknown and so did two of my friends. We didn't quite believe in that stuff then though, so we only played around to see if something would happen. One day, we were talking about spirits, magic and etc. One of my friends then started talking about the devil. I decided I'd jump into the conversation and so I made a huge mistake after that. I said ""The devil should just come here if he exists, just to prove to us that he's there. I'm sure he doesn't"" I said that on purpose just to see if anything would happen.

That was the worst thing I could say or do. I called upon the devil. What a mistake. Then, somehow I didn't notice it but my friends did. I was continuing to talk when I fainted on the bed. My friends thought I was joking because we would pretend to faint just to scare each other. To me, it's as if everything blanked out for a second but to my friends it was a minute before I got up. They were starting to get worried because usually I wouldn't have retained my laughter for so long. They also said I stopped breathing when I fainted. When I got up, it's as if everything was normal and I kept on talking about the thing I was talking about earlier on. Although, I didn't know how I got up or even how I fell down. I just heard them talking in the background.

Then suddenly they said ""Why'd you pretend to faint!? You scared the crap out of us!"" I looked at them with a puzzled look on my face, I had no idea what they were talking about. They were serious too. Then I told them I didn't pretend to do anything, I just kept on talking with them. They just looked at me as if they didn't believe me. I just let it go and we ignored it.

A few years later we talked about the same event that happened. We never forgot about it because after that, I had been followed by evil everywhere I went. Right after that event, my attitude changed and I became mean to people. Which I usually wouldn't do. I expressed my anger on people and hurt their feelings without my own will. After that, I would feel bad and apologize because I never had wanted to do what I did but it started again. It's as if something else had control over me. That stopped after a few months though and it never happened again. I was myself again but that wasn't the only thing that happened after that event.

Some strange things happened and I would be woken up in the middle of the night only to find myself sitting on my bed instead of lying on it. I'd see shadows and usually I was always followed by some sort of evil, I could never forget that feeling.

Well as I said, this stopped a few months later and it never started again. Thank god. I think I learned my lesson after this. Usually though, people get followed by evil for a whole lot of time after calling upon the devil or things like that. I guess I got lucky.

Child Scare at 2 am,"California, United States",Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: Child Scare at 2 am

T his happened last night, and it scared me to death. I'm 17 years old and live in california. I was on my computer being the average teenager, talking to my friends. It was obviously dark outside, but really quite warm in my house. I was bored of listening to nothing but the sounds of the whining computer and turning fan, so I got up and turned my fan and lights off and got my iPod to listen to. I had gone through about an hours worth of songs and it was nearing my favorite part... then my ipod decides to skip like a cd player would. When it skipped, I distinctly heard a child cough and then chuckle. This scares me a bit, but I decide it's nothing and put my music away, telling my friends what had happened. They say it's probably nothing and that there was just a flaw in my music, so I go back to normal talking.

Three minutes later my room gets icy cold, and I swear if the lights were on I could see my breath coming out. So I tell my friend what happens and they say ""Sam, that's not good... You should turn on the lights or something so that it doesn't come after you or anything. They can't touch you in the light..."" I thought about this for a second or two, deciding if it was true or not, but I thought it wouldn't hurt to turn the lights on.

As soon as I stood up, I heard some footsteps on the floor and shuffling noises against the wall right next to the light switch. Sitting down, I thought to myself ""That plans out of the park..."" Starting to get a little more creeped out, I sit down and watch my room intently, listening for anything and watching for any movement. I'm like a 4 year old when it comes to ghosts, so I'm surprised I didn't scream and run to my older sister.

I went on with life talking to people and stuff, not caring what happens from then on. But I heard the footsteps again, and they're getting closer to me. My neighborhood is connected on the electricity grid and my power goes out. And I look outside and see my neighbors lights all on. So I get a little more scared. Then the shuffling noise comes from my chair and I freeze. A small hand falls on my shoulder and I can't breathe for like a minute. Then my room suddenly gets warm again and I choke down a breath of air. The lights come back on and I hear foot steps walking down the stairs that lead to my room.

I didn't sleep at all last night... And about 30 minutes after all this happened to me, my sister screams because she had a nightmare. I officially and afraid of my house. Haha.

Slumber Party Nightmare,Canada,Apparitions / Voices / Touches,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Apparitions / Voices / Touches :: Slumber Party Nightmare

M e and my friends never did want to see whatever happened on that night, at my friends slumber party, all alone in an apartment. We set up the beds for the living room and made sure that the door was locked, all the time I felt as if I was being watched. My new friend, Amy, looked at me and said ""Are you all right?"" and I nodded and got my pillow and blanket out of my bag as the girls did the same.

Soon as we set finally set up the sleeping sides (Amy, Christina, Amy, yeah we have the same names) slept on the bed closest to the hallway and the kitchen (Latesha and Carla slept on the bed near the T.V and the window). Carla said she might not be able to sleep over when we were eating junk Christina's mother bought for the party. Soon after we finished half the stuff, we got dressed on our PJ's and my friends said we were going to go get Latesha's stuff and go ask if Carla can sleep over. Carla lived just in the next apartment and we dropped her off since she wasn't allowed... Latesha lived FAR away, we were to terrified and Amy whispered to me that she felt something following us, I said the same to her and we both hugged each other while the other girls were strangely quiet.

Amy freaked when she said something was surely following us and she said she wanted to go back and then she muttered ""It's coming!"", And then a stupid car drived by us very fast splashing me with a bit of water and Amy too. We all screamed and ran halfway toward Latesha's house.

Amy looked more frightened and I put an arm around her telling her that ghosts can't hurt us. She never replied as she continued to walk toward Latesha's house. A 'Banshee' scream echoed through the place... We all stopped and slowly turned around and saw a shadow run in the forest. This time we all quickly walked, not speaking and hardly breathing. Soon as her got Latesha's stuff (me nearly getting attacked by a small cat at the time) we walked back to Christina's apartment, still being followed. We soon forgot about the thing and Carla was waiting outside the apartment with her bag and everything.

An hour later at 11:30,  we all ate some more pizza and cake and watched the music channel. We all were soon dancing with that flashy thingy going on and suddenly in the middle of Amy's dance, it went out and we all started screaming. Everyone fell on the bed as a shadow entered the kitchen. Christina, being the smart one, tried to get the flashy thingy going (the light switch was in the hallway and no way anyone was going in there). The shadow soon disappeared and the flashy thingy died on us many times. Someone was nearly in tears as they were all under my blanket with me hugging my pillow.

Soon Latesha jumped up and ran in the hallway and turned on the light. And then a few minutes before 12:00, we all got a slice of cake and put a candle on it, I said we should blow out the candles at 12:00. Soon as we did, I saw the shadow again, But I never told. At 1:00 nothing happened as we got ready for bed, I was the last one to sleep and I watched that shadow wander around in the kitchen. I soon fell asleep with a calm feeling

The Chandelier,"Maryland, United States",Poltergeists / Physical Manifestations,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Poltergeists / Physical Manifestations :: The Chandelier

I was relatively young when my father and I watched the chandelier, probably eight or nine. I was living in a house that had been constructed naught but ten years ago. It was my father's house, as my parents were divorced, and it was very large. It had a single sort of winding stair case to an overhang above the foyer, that was a railed hallway to the other rooms. To be frank, I was fascinated by ghosts, but hated large houses. Unexplainable things were both enthralling and horrible to me. Generally if I wasn't by myself, I'd drag anybody I could along to go 'ghost hunting'. I was convinced my father's house was haunted, even though it was so young. Though the original owner of the house had died while still owning it, he was not inside the house, and therefore my father would try to convince me nothing was wrong.

But he could not explain the odd things that constantly happened in bad fortune -the pipes breaking suddenly, our porch falling on itself... Probably the most frightening was two days after the new family who had bought our house moved in, it was struck by lightening and the entire roof caught on fire. My pregnant stepmother was upstairs asleep. It must have been about ten thirty at night, and I can't distinctly remember what season it was, but I believe it was pretty warm outside. My father and I had been watching a late-night television show and were on our way to bed. As we climbed the stairs, I was telling him about a phenomenal dream I had where I was riding in a buggy, and a boy pressed his face to the window. It wasn't a frightening face, on the contrary quite attractive, yet I knew somehow, distinctly, I knew him... I couldn't place how.

Exactly as I was telling him of the boy I looked in the mirror, and saw the electric chandelier in our dining room go on, despite the fact that my father had distinctly turned it off. Now, before I continue, I must explain that I hate mirrors. Every dream I've ever had with a mirror involves something frightening, by staring at my reflection and seeing something else look back at me. I avoid mirrors as much as possible. But it was odd, because I had no desire to look in the mirror when I was telling the story, but I did. I soon pointed the chandelier out to my father, who mused for a bit and said he just must've ""forgotten to turn it off"". My father does not believe in ghosts.

I didn't want to budge from where I was, so I asked my father to turn it off. He obliged, and the second he took a step, the light went off... Then it went on... Then it went off... Very slowly. Mind you that we could practically hear my stepmother snoring in the other room, and the three of us were the only ones in the house. My father was slightly alarmed, and took another step. On cue, the lights began to flash brighter, and more frequently. Now I was on the verge of screaming, so I urged him to stop ""this stupid magic trick"". He assured me this was not his doing and began to race down the stairs. The lights began to flicker incredibly fast with each hurdle he took. On. Off. On. Off. On. Off. I was crying and my father dashed across the foyer, into the living room, but he never quite made the light switch. It flashed an unfathomably brightly, more so than the setter could ever allow, and went out. My father, left in the dark, testily walked over to the light switched which was still remaining in 'off'. He flicked it on, and it worked like a charm. We both went to bed and said nothing about it until the next morning.

My father told me a white lie saying that the switch had been 'stuck' in the middle which caused it to flicker. Only later did he tell me that was untrue, and he only told me that so I didn't have any worries. What alarms me is that the house was built over an ancient railroad track, which had been disabled probably seven decades ago, and it might have been partly because of my active imagination, but I was convinced a little girl lived in our house. Of course, my grandmother fueled my beliefs by saying she saw the same thing. Was it the little girl? Or was it just me?

While my father does not believe in ghosts, and assures me he never will, this is one event he can never come to explain, and leaves it at that. My step mother still yells about not being awake to see it, as she too loves the ghost encounters. Any ideas of what could have caused this?

Chocolate,Belize,Apparitions / Voices / Touches,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Apparitions / Voices / Touches :: Chocolate

I t was exactly 12:47 at night, and I was trying to fall asleep. I was a vulnerable and gullible 3 year old at the time, so I didn't exactly know it was wrong to follow strangers, especially if they were luring me with a hershey bar my most favorite candy at the time. Well, I heard someone say ""Jessica, Jessie, come here I have a surprise! Jessie, come down, I have something for you..."" it was coming from downstairs from the den. It sounded exactly like my neighbor, miss cassie.

I was only 3 so I wasn't thinking about how they got in. I then got out of bed and went to the den and a woman, not miss cassie, was standing there holding out a chocolate bar. At first, she was beautiful, saying ""come on, its ok, just chocolate. Take it. Eat it. Come on its ok I don't bite..."" Then, I stood there just staring at her. She got frustrated that I wouldn't take the chocolate, turned hideous, like a person who was taken out of their casket after 5 years underground, and charged, I screamed and ran upstairs to my mom's room. She calmed me down, and to this day doesn't believe me on what happened.

And also to this day, I distinctly remember that experience and flinch when someone farther away calls my name for me to come to them. Also, now I hate hershey bars.

"My Dog, an Old Friend",Italy,Pets / Animals,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Pets / Animals :: My Dog, an Old Friend

A few years back, I had a wonderful pet dog. She was a black lab and a very good and loyal friend. If I was sad, she would lay next to me and comfort me. I never felt scared when she was around.

Then, at the age of 14 (very old for a dog), she died. I was so lonely after that. I didn't quite know how I was going to cope with it. Everything seemed so hopeless. I would think back to the day when she walked right in the door, a stray. She just walked right into my life, now it seemed as if she had just walked out.

Then one day, while I was thinking about her, I had this weird feeling that she was still here. It felt as if she was waiting at the door to come in. I figured that it was just me wanting her to be here that made me feel like this. I tried to brush it off, but I couldn't. The feeling was just too strong.

So I got up and went to the big, sliding glass door and peered outside. I saw nothing. There wasn't even a rustle of leaves from the wind to liven it up out there. All seemed dead. I felt disappointed inside. But I still felt like she was there. So I opened the door anyway. Then, to my joy and amazement, a huge breeze of cool air swept into the room. It was her coming in. I felt happy and sad at the same time. I was able to get over the loss after this. I guess she was there to comfort me after all. She found a way.

The Man Who Was with Me,"Texas, United States",Old Hags / Night Attacks / Sleep Paralysis,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Old Hags / Night Attacks / Sleep Paralysis :: The Man Who Was with Me

I n 2001, I lived in arizona with my mother and my sister at my grandma's house. We were such a happy family until something bad happened! My mom's friend's grandpa died on May 12, 2001. We all went to his funeral and prayed for him to make a better life in heaven. 2 weeks later, I was sleeping and I heard my door open. I looked up and nothing was there. At first I thought it was my older sister just giving me a hard time trying to scare me. So, I got up and I went to her room and I saw that she was asleep. I didn't think that it was my mom's friend's grandpa, even though me and him were best buddies. He would always buy me ice cream, walk with me in the park. But I woke her up and I told her to stop trying to scare me. And she told me that I was probably dreaming or heard a mouse in the walls. I told her that my door had opened by its self.

The next day I was home alone, and I was just watching tv. I heard a man's voice in my ear calling my name. I shouted out, ""who is it? Stop playing around! I don't want to be scared anymore, and just go away!"" it NEVER left me alone! At night time, it came in my room and sat next to me on my bed while I was sleeping. I woke up, and saw my mom's friend's grandpa sitting next to me. He just stared at me with his deep eyes. I screamed and I wanted to run out of my room, but something was holding me back. It wasn't him who was holding me back, it was something more powerful, something that could hurt me if IT wanted to! I was never scared in my entire life!

When my mom came running in my room, everything paranormal that was in my room just went away, like it was scared of her. The next day I asked my mom to have our church bless the house so nothing would harm the family. But, as usual, the blessing didn't work. It didn't change anything! Then at night again, he came in my room and this time, he did not sit on my bed. He just stood there staring at me! And the thing that was holding me back, it was there to. But this time I could see it. It looked like a younger man, he wore army pants and shirt, and he looked very mad.

Why do they want me? I kept asking myself. But they just stood there with anger and terror on their faces. Why would they want me any how? I never did anything wrong to them! I was only 8 or 9 when this happened. And what would a 8 or 9 year old do to make these things come into the house?

A few weeks later, we had an exorcism, which was okay, I guess. These things that were here were using my mom's friend's grandpa's spirit as a gate way to the house (that's what the psychic said that came to my house with the priest that was going to do the exorcism).

That was the most frightening thing in my life! But now, I am 14 living a good life in texas! And I am glad the paranormal is out and gone.

My Encounter with the Demon Itself,"Texas, United States",Demons / Possessions / Exorcisms,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Demons / Possessions / Exorcisms :: My Encounter with the Demon Itself

E veryday I woke up late at night about 3:00 in the morning. I was always tired, I got no sleep, and I was never hungry. My mother, Linda, was always worried about me because I was always in my room and always listening to music that I would never listen to, which was Hard, Hard rock music. I had no idea that I was turning mean and angry, and when my mom wasn't around, I would drink and cut my self. I was so angry! I would walk around town with this evil expression, and I wouldn't even look at anybody.

Finally, my mom took me to the hospital and asked if there was something wrong with me. They told her that everything was normal and nothing seemed wrong with me, until they found that I was cutting myself. They asked me if I been feeling okay, and I just stared at them with hate; evil, and hurt. They all just waited and I finally said, ""What does my life mean to you? You never saved a life, and even if you did you won't save me. You bastards never made my life happier, so what makes you think your going to make me happy now?"" I had no idea what I was saying. I was out of it, and I had no clue why! I cussed at the doctor, not really meaning it!

That night, I was out of it. I couldn't sleep and I felt like something was watching me. I went crazy! I went so crazy I started talking to nothing. ""What do you want with me? You son of a B*tch! I never wanted this, let me go!"" I talked and talked, with no responses. My mother heard me talking one night and thought I was on the phone with somebody.

She walked in my room and said she saw a demonic presence sitting next to me. I thought she was just talking trash to scare me. Then all of a sudden, I started yelling across the room! I was yelling latin and backwards english. I had no clue what I was saying. I never thought I would become possessed.

Was it that he wanted my good soul? I don't really know, but the demon possessing me was making my family depressed and sad and it got so bad, that I pushed myself away from my family. To tell you the truth, I had plenty of experiences! With the grandpa and his ghostly friend holding me back on my bed, and the other things that I might tell you in my other stories. But, a month later, 3 priest came to bless my house (it was that bad!). When they blessed the house, the demon came out of me and stayed out for 2 months. Then it became a big problem. IT CAME BACK!

""What are we going to do with her? Why did they have to pick her instead of me? I don't want my daughter having this happen to her. It's not what I wanted for her in life..."" my mother would say to my father. Then 2 weeks later, we had an exorcism to help get rid of the possession. After the exorcism, I was wiped out! I was so tired, and more hungry than I have ever been. It made me so drained, and to know how much it hurt my family, made me so angry.

Now that it is out of me now, I am writing this to the people who had ruff times with things they could never imagine to happen. Look, I am a real ex...periencer. If you never had these things happen, let me know! Because these things can happen when you least expect it!

Pactolus Ghost Light AKA The Stokes Light,"North Carolina, United States",Photographs / Videos / EVP,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Photographs / Videos / EVP :: Pactolus Ghost Light AKA The Stokes Light

I have been going to Pactolus my entire life outside Greenville, NC. I recently caught what I believe to be a ghost light aka orb on video for 30 seconds at around 100 yards away. Catching this Ghost Light on video has changed my life. It makes me want to research every ghost light I have ever heard of. Watch the video at the bottom for yourself and you be the judge...

The story of the light goes like this: The story begins sometime in the early 1900's. A young man rode his horse from Greenville to Pactolus. Pactolus is a small community east of Greenville. At this time, there was a train station in existence in the Pactolus community. The purpose of this trip was to surprise the young man's fiancee by meeting her train. Unfortunately, the train was extremely late this particular evening and the young man was soon alone in the dark. Of course, he really was not alone. His horse was very impressive and caught the attention of three men who were walking along the train tracks. They decided that this was a perfect opportunity to catch a ride rather than walk to their destination. The three men hid in the brush surrounding the train station and as the young man rode by, he was ambushed and killed. The three men hid his body in the thickness of the woods. However, the horse was frightened away and returned to Greenville two days later. The family feared the worse after the horse returned without his rider. They searched the train station and the surrounding area only to find nothing.

The young man's ghost is seen walking beside the train tracks. The form he takes is a single light floating beside the tracks. Sometimes the light floats at waist level (as if he is walking beside his horse) and other times the light floats above the head, as if he is riding his horse). The young man uses the light to let his fiancee know that he was there to meet her.

The tracks have long been removed and all that remains now is a path. The land is now privately owned. Those who go to the area are promptly chased away. This proves the point to always get permission first and limit your party time to private places.

If you think you have seen it all; think again! We are not alone on in the tar heel state...

I have caught this ghost light on film over 15 with a Sony DVX 2100 Mini DV Recorder. High Quality Footage...

Animal Ghost?,"Alaska, United States",Pets / Animals,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Pets / Animals :: Animal Ghost?

B efore I begin, I must say that my house is only about fifteen or sixteen years old. We are only the second family in it and the first lived here for about eleven years. I don't know if any of their pets died here, but I know I had a chinchilla who died in the room I am in. Well, this morning I heard what sounded like an animal walking. Actually, it sounded like my cats, and they were in the room, but they were laying down. I heard a slight clack every few seconds, always a few feet away from the last. My cats were not creeped out, but one of them was looking in the direction the sound was coming from, and a few minutes after it started, one stood up and walked to near where I had heard it. While she was walking to the window (she likes to look out at the forest by our house) she looked around her as if watching for something. My cats are very smart, and sometimes they seem to be telling me something. I think animals are more likely to experience paranormal things, especially dogs and cats.

By the way, the chinchilla that died in the room was very sweet. He would run over to the side of his cage whenever I entered the room, and sometimes, I don't know why I did this, but one day he was in his ball and I was imagining him going to parts of the room, and he did it, unless it was to come to me. My pets often become some of my best friends, even though I have human ones. But my human friends don't call me or come over to my house often.

The people who owned the house before us could have had a pet that died, but I don't know much about them. I can't think of anything that would make a noise like I heard, and it's the first time I've heard it. Also, I often feel like I'm being watched in that room.

Friendly Night Visitor,"California, United States",Apparitions / Voices / Touches,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Apparitions / Voices / Touches :: Friendly Night Visitor

T his is a follow up to a story titled - Frequent Night Visitors . I am 23. I've had quite a few paranormal experiences over the last 2 years. I can't be 100% sure if I'm dreaming or if it is reality. But it 'seems' like I am 'awake' every time. Most of the experiences have been pretty scary until the most recent one I had. This one was unlike anything I've ever experienced. It was serene and calming, almost as if I was being protected.

I was sleeping at my Mom's house one evening... I've had experiences there prior to this one. My Mom has mirrors in her quest bedroom and I heard that mirrors can be a pathway for the 'other side' to get through to 'our side'. So as I was going to sleep, I had an intuition that I was going to get a visitor, and I said to myself not to be afraid and just ask:

I soon fell asleep. I remember waking up to the feeling of not being able to move or speak, as if I was paralyzed. It didn't feel like a dream because I was IN the room and aware of EVERYTHING I was doing. Not like MY dreams at all. I heard voices all over, little kids voices and adult voices, laughing and not really making a lot of sense. Over the voices there was a humming/murmur in my ear. I told myself to remember everything that occurs, because I can't tell if I'm dreaming or if it's real.

I then just remember getting really scared of some presence in the room, I didn't feel safe at all. But, I remember my Dad told me that they can't hurt me and I have more power over them then they do over me . He told me to ""tell any 'visitors' to leave if they have bad intentions, but if they were 'visiting' because they needed something, do all I can to help them."" So, I asked whatever it was I heard, (I can't see anything this time, just hear them)...

If you do NOT have Good Intentions you MUST leave immediately!

All of a sudden I DISTINCTLY felt these two gentle hands brush through my hair like a wave washing over my head. The hands felt so clear and unmistakable to me, that I knew they were a woman's hands. She kept running her hands through my hair as if she was behind me, and then I felt, plain as day, her slowly pulling my hair band out of my hair. Now, the whole time this was happening I was saying to myself... Remember this, remember this, you know what is occurring, remember! She then started gently massaging my neck and shoulders. It was so calming yet shocking because I have never experienced something quite like this before. Then after approximately 3 minutes, I felt her presence leave, and it was as if she cleared the room. As if she had told everyone to let me be.

This calming serene feeling washed over me and it was just still and quiet in the room. Now I won't swear that I am 200% confident I'm not just 'dreaming', but I swear I have never felt something so clear as that experience. It was so real. As real as being wide awake feels.

I would like to keep experimenting with these 'visitors' and instead of getting scared, start asking the 'presence' how I can help.

Anything Is Possible... Don't Let Fear Limit The Possibilities!

Ghost Car at Grandma's,"Indiana, United States",Apparitions / Voices / Touches,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Apparitions / Voices / Touches :: Ghost Car at Grandma's

I was about 6 (now 15) and my sister was 9 (now 18) and we were spending the weekend with my grandma. We had been laying in bed for about an hour and we were just talking and we couldn't fall asleep. My sister said she heard something saying her name and she wanted to go see who it was, so we both got up and went to my grandma's room but she was asleep and there was no one else in the house. Kkeep this in mind, her house is way in the middle of nowhere and the closest house is a mile away and it's off a main road. Me and my sister decided to get something to drink. My grandma's house has a huge bay window in the living room and you have to walk past to go into the kitchen, the window curtains were closed when we went past it, we were in the kitchen and we heard what sounded like a car driving away so we went to look and the window curtains were wide open and the dust was in the air like a car did drive past. Then we were just like ""well whatever it's nothing"" so we went to go back to bed but we couldn't sleep so we started talking and we talked about what happened and we decided to tell my grandma about what happened.

The next morning we got up and went to tell her and she says she had experienced things like that too.

The Boy at Disney World,"Kentucky, United States",Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: The Boy at Disney World

I told many people about this, but most people don't believe me. Even my parents say it was just a dream. But this is true. You may not believe me, but I saw and experienced it myself. It was maybe around 3 years ago, when I was 9 and me and my friends were at disney land. We got on many different types of rides, and we were about to rest. I was clutching on my cotton candy and ice cream cone with a spoon in my mouth. I told them to go ahead as I stop and put my stuff down for a little bit. Then I stuck the spoon into the ice cream cone and was ready, when I got lost.

I was surrounded by millions of people, and they were all unfamiliar faces. I sat were I was and whispered my mom and dad's names every 2 sec. When I looked back, there was a another boy, crying and wouldn't stop. I felt sorry for him and came up to him to say what was the matter but something unusual happened. When I was running up to him, I was actually getting farther away from him! You might not believe it but I have experienced it myself. I finally stopped for a break, when suddenly, I realized that he was glaring at me. A bluish orb surrounded him, but then he vanished.

You might think that was the ending, but it was not. Since that day, he has been following me. He follows where ever I go, scares my friends by pinching and whispering in there ear, ""mommy...""

Sexual Entities,"Oregon, United States",Succubus / Incubus / Sexual Ghosts,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Succubus / Incubus / Sexual Ghosts :: Sexual Entities

T his started around July, 2006. My partner Bruce and I have been together for 12 years now. We are close, we are active, volunteer with many disaster response agencies and are relatively well grounded people. We attend church now and then, and are usually one of those couples who stay home for the most part, and enjoy movies and BBQing our summer nights away.

One night, while the both of us were asleep in in our double King bed, you know, one of those you can drop a bowling ball on with the other one remaining asleep. So this can take a lot of punishment.

It was around 3am, when I awoke, feeling the bed shimmering now and then. We have dogs, but I could see all three asleep in the hallway. I dismissed it and went back to bed. I felt it again, and again. I then felt something slip next to us, over to Bruce, then settling down for a moment. I fell back asleep. But awoke again to some serious movement, shimmering, and a rhythmic movement like a slow erotic massage. All I know, was I could feel this sense of intense sexual arousal. I felt over to Bruce, and noticed a shaking, then I lifted up the blankets, and got the flashlight next to the bed, and I saw his penis being moved around, his scrotum being moved around, I saw his hips being slightly lifted up, and moved around. He was sound asleep, but this thing was having oral sex with him. He was slightly moaning in his sleep. I told it to go away, in fact I demanded it. It did. Never said a word about it.

Two nights later, I awoke again, this time I felt something whirling around my feet. Kind of an erotic electrical current, or whirlwind around my feet, then my legs felt this pressure, and I watched my legs getting rolled outward. It came up under the covers, and was doing things to turn me on. I had no idea what the heck, so I just watched for a moment to experience what Bruce must have felt (I watch all the Discover channels, I am a Producer, so I am always wanting to experience and learn, well almost everything).

This intense feeling of sexual pleasure came up to my hip area started doing things slowly, really slowly, and as if it had a road map to every spot that I had, including ones I did not know I had. If I thought of something, it went there, so I don't know. It was the most intense sexual feeling I have ever felt. I honestly don't know where it came from, but if you could bottle that. I told it to go away and not to return. It did not.

We eventually moved because this was too much. Including the dogs barking at the corner with nothing there, I began to tape (have a recording device for work) the bathroom while Bruce was taking a shower, and to my total horror and surprise, he was talking to it, like and old friend. He would ask it a question, and even though I know it was Bruce, it still sounded like someone else coming from his voice box.

So I began to record regularly, and this thing started answering questions for me. I did tell Bruce what I was doing, but not when. This thing was regularly talking with him. One night, I stayed up very late to say hello before he went to bed after his shift. It was around 4am. I was on the toilet and recording, and jokingly asked it ""I am inviting you to go through me to answer my question, why are you doing this, why are you having sex with Bruce most every night. How many are there of you and where are you?""

I fell asleep for a moment due to meds (home ill from the hospital, pneumonia), I fell asleep for a moment, and my own voice although altered a little said...""We are sorry, don't mean to hurt you, just need your bodies, have to have sex, it is the only way, please let us, we won't hurt you. There are 3 of us. And we are in your bed. When we want to come out, we roll around underneath the mattress very slowly, to see if you want or are willing to let us in. Please forgive us... We mean no harm"". I turned off the recorder the moment I awoke, and played it the next morning.

I was blown away. I noticed Bruce's personality changing a lot lately too, we eventually moved. The third night there, or day, I was taking a shower, no one was there besides me, I looked up, and through the shower curtain, I saw a short shadow of a male, about 5 ft. tall, scurrying by the showered curtain, to the wall. I opened the curtain, and saw nothing, and the door was locked. I continued my shower, then suddenly felt this whirlwind of electrical field around my feet, and it worked it's way up, it was like an orgasm in feeling, and if I had not demanded it to leave, I don't know what I would have done.

There is a lot more, if anyone wants to hear. There is a Priest who came over, and his son felt it in the bed, the Priest began getting tossed around in his bed, and other things, like the manager of the complex said, she lost another resident because of the same thing. So, have a lot to share.

The Haunted Woods,"Georgia, United States",Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: The Haunted Woods

I have had many strange experiences in and around my home, however most have occurred in the woods near my house such as a ghostly confederate flag waving on the top of a hill where I had just come from, also I have seen dogs running through the woods late at night passing through trees as if they were not there.

My most creepy experience was not very scary, I had come down to a pond in the woods to try and catch some fish I had done this many times and was used to the random noises, then seemingly out of thin air an elderly man came up and talked with me, after talking for a little while he walked away to try fishing himself, I glanced over a few times and noticed there was no splash and simply ignored it. The final time I glanced over I noticed him walking towards the highway on the far side of the pond when suddenly he disappeared. This was VERY creepy as I had been talking with him not long before.

Also I have a friend that lives directly across the road from those woods who has seen strange things running through the field. I have witnessed many strange occurrences around my neighborhood, I have an aunt who committed suicide on the other side of the block, my father's grandparents lived in my house all their lives and I have seen them many times, the most recent was a few nights ago when my family was sleeping in our living room, my dad was sleeping in his chair on the far side of the room and they were standing directly over him looking at us so I went back to sleep.

"Shadow People,  Thumps and Bumps","Michigan, United States",Poltergeists / Physical Manifestations,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Poltergeists / Physical Manifestations :: Shadow People,  Thumps and Bumps

I don't know really how the whole story came into effect. But I know it's true. I live in Saint Clair, Michigan and I'm a freshmen at SCHS. I've always believed in the supernatural, magic, etc. But I was ignorant to think that nothing special or odd would present itself to me. I had been home alone at the time, sitting in my room, which is in the far corner of the house. My door lead out into a hall that branched into two other rooms, a bathroom, then eventually my kitchen and living room.

I was sitting in my room at making bracelets out of yarn, and watching Buffy The Vampire Slayer when I heard a knock on my door. Now I figured my parents were home, or it was a sibling. But I hadn't heard the front door. I remember getting up and going to the door to check, and no one was there. Peeved, thinking it was the cats, I had moved down the hall to check the rooms. To see if it had been one of my cats, which I have three by the way.

I went into the living room and two of my cats were lounging out in the window, watching the cars pass by, the third was asleep. So it wasn't them. At that moment I remembered being cold, and something shoved me. Now I was scared, I turned to see a shadow type thing disappear. I remembered being to terrified, but unable to move.

My cats also had been acting strange, my one cat Zippo was whining up a storm. Almost howling. I ran into my room again, locking my door. Good move, I had said to myself. A door is sure going to stop a dead person. But I wasn't exactly sure. So I had gone to sit on my bed when the door was knocked on. Now, I wasn't moving. Soon it sounded like someone was stopping up and down the hall having a good old time from the sound of it too. I had turned the volume up, but the more I did, the louder and more aggressive the pounding became. Until I had yelled for whatever it was to go away, how it wasn't welcome, and to leave immediately. In the hall the stomping had stopped after one final smash. Now I didn't leave my room.

My parents eventually came home, and they weren't happy. Turned out in the hall, all the picture frames and their glass was busted. And where the final stomp had been, I had found a penny. Let's just say, I didn't sleep that night.

Are Ghosts Following Me?,"California, United States",,"T his all started happening when I was about 10 years old. I slept over at my grandmother's house once and I slept in the downstairs living room. In the middle of the night, I awoke to the sound of footsteps in the hallway and a sound of a wheelchair being rolled around in the hallway and kitchen. This went on for 30 minutes or so, then the hall closet door opened and closed and I didn't hear anything else.

On a different occasion I went over to my grandmother's house to baby sit my younger cousin. I put him in his room upstairs for a nap in the afternoon and I went down and listened to music on the computer. I got up and walked by the garage door in the hallway and it was opened, which is strange because I hadn't gone out there. I figured my cousin had so I closed the door. I went to the kitchen to get some water came back down the hall and the garage door was open again, so I closed it and went and sat back down at the computer listening to my music, which was pretty loud I might add. All of a sudden I hear the door opening and then slamming shut repeatedly. I went into the hall way and no one was there but the door was opening and closing. I ran upstairs, woke up my cousin and stayed outside.

A year or two later I was at my house in my room sleeping in my bed. The door to my bedroom was open and the hall light was on, so my room wasn't dark at all. Our house made a lot of noises especially when you're walking, you can hear where everyone is in the house by the way the floor creaks. So, as I was sleeping, I was awoken and I heard footsteps in the living room (which is next to my bedroom) and I figured my mom had gotten up and was in the living room. I keep hearing these footsteps and they get closer and closer and then I hear them in the hall. Now my bedroom door is wide open and I can see down the hall and the light is on, no one is there. Then I hear footsteps at the doorway in my room right inside my bedroom. But I cannot see anyone. I'm pretty scared at this point. Then I hear the floor creak right next to my bed as if someone stepped closer. All of a sudden I feel weight on my feet like someone is sitting there, and within seconds, someone or something is tucking my blankets around my legs like a mother or grandmother would do. I freak out and start kicking frantically the weight lifts off my legs... And I don't hear anything...

My sister said she sees an older lady in our room sitting in a rocking chair at night and the lady stares at her while she's sleeping.

The Only Ghost I've Ever Seen,"California, United States",Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: The Only Ghost I've Ever Seen

N ow since I was 9-10 years old I've felt ghosts, they've touched me and I've heard them before but I hadn't seen them until a year and 1/2 ago when I was 18. My family and I had just moved out of our house which we had lived in since I was in kindergarten to about 12 years. In this house I was sure there was a ghost, but it was a nice ghost and only bothered me a few times. We were moving into a two story townhouse and I adored the place. My and my sister's room was upstairs and it had a balcony that went off of it and huge sliding glass doors. After staying there a few nights, my room would be too cold to bare and I complained to my mom that it was freezing in there. It was weird because the rest of the house was actually pretty hot. My mom said it was because of the sliding glass door and she went and bought very thick curtains. It warmed up the room a little bit but not much.

I'd usually come home around 10:30 or 11 at night and talk to my boyfriend on the phone before I go to sleep. Then I'd go upstairs and go to my room and go to sleep. I always got the feeling I was being watched but I just ignored it. In the middle of the night I heard footsteps running back and forth in the hallway, I figured it was my parents or my brother. All of our rooms were on the 2nd floor. The next morning I asked all of them if they had gotten up last night and were walking around in the hallway and they said no. So I just ignored it.

Another night around 1 or 2 in the morning I was awoken by footsteps down the stairs and then the door to our backyard opening and closing like someone was slamming it. I was pretty scared so I turned over in my bed and closed my eyes and forced myself back to sleep.

I told my boyfriend about how I feel weird in my room, like someone is watching me, and that I always feel like someone is in there with me. He says that I'm crazy, until one night he came over and we went to my room to watch a movie. The T.V. was by the sliding glass doors that go out to the balcony and he was putting in the movie, when he dropped it and looked over at me. And I was like ""what!?"" He said... Now I don't want to scare you but... I just saw a lady standing on your balcony and then she just vanished. He told me she had long blonde/white hair and had a blue dress on. Unfortunately, I didn't see her but my boyfriend sure started believing me then.

Another time, my boyfriend was babysitting my 1 year old brother at my house and no one else was there and he had put my brother upstairs in his crib to sleep. He had heard some footsteps upstairs and some noise so he went up there and while he was walking up the stairs, the bathroom light was on, so he turned it off. He walked into my parents room where the crib was and looked around and my brother was asleep. He went back down the hall turned to go down the stairs when he looked over and noticed the bathroom light was ON now. He thought nothing of it and turned it off and went downstairs. Once downstairs he heard more footsteps so he proceeded back up the stairs and noticed the bathroom light was ON again. He went into my parents room and there my brother was sitting straight up staring at the wall. Which is weird because when he wakes up he usually cries but he hadn't and he didn't even look over when my boyfriend walked in.

A week later or so, me, my boyfriend, my step dad, and brother were in the living room and we were all sitting on the couch. I heard a noise and I looked over and I saw a woman standing there and I said ""MOM?"" and the woman vanished. So I got up and I thought maybe my mom was home, so I looked all over for her, she wasn't there. It was the same woman my boyfriend had seen on the balcony with blonde hair and a blue dress. My mom has blonde hair that's why I had thought it was her.

On another occurrence, my boyfriend spent the night downstairs at my house and in the middle of the night, he woke up and the same woman was there standing at the end of the couch staring at him. She stayed there for a few minutes then walked away and he saw her feet going up the stairs. He then heard footsteps in the hallway above him going straight to my room.

She was so weird, the only ghost I have ever seen. She didn't seem mean but she seemed like she needed attention or something she actually really creeped me out and I don't know why.

The Jennifer Baca Story:  A Haunting Investigation,"California, United States",Ghost Hunting,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Ghost Hunting :: The Jennifer Baca Story:  A Haunting Investigation

T here is a blue moon tonight, so that makes things even more eerie. I think back when I was in the Army. The Army had scouts to check things out, before a unit made their move on an enemy site. H.P.I. (Haunted and Paranormal Investigations) of Northern California has their own scouts. Tonight HPI Paranormal Investigator Jennifer Baca and I, will scout out two haunted locations in Elk Grove and one haunted location in the Pocket Area of Sacramento. Today is June 1st, 2007, Friday. Jennifer with her big smile arrives at my home in Elk Grove, she is eager to do some ghost hunting. I bring along my Jack Russell Terrier named Pika. Pika has sensed a ghost once at the Old Broadway Cemetery, so he might be useful in this investigation. You can say Pika is a paranormal investigating dog, while my black Chow T-Rex is oblivious to any kind of hauntings. Pika will sit and watch the Cartoon Network or the Animal Planet and T-Rex is only concerned with food. So, unfortunately T-Rex stays home, while Pika gets to go on this ghost hunt with Jennifer and I.

When my son Jason lived at home, Jason and his friends would party near the wetlands. Some of the kids would party at a clump of Eucalyptus trees and also party at a historical site called the Lee/Wightman site off Big Horn Blvd. Jason's friends claimed they have seen a white wisp near the trees and at the historical site. I never took any credence to their claims, but later discovered that the clump of trees were imported from Australia. Because Eucalyptus trees usually grow in clumps and they are tall, they make for good shelter. Shelter that were used my early settlers of the Elk Grove region. The historical site that Jennifer and I will also investigate is the Lee/Wightman Site. A site that once had a blacksmith shop there in 1865. Renovations done in 1907, and later a barn and tenant house that was built on the site in 1936. There is nothing there now, except a sign describing what was once there. The sign says that it was a ranch with a main house, blacksmith shop, smoke house, barn granary, pumphouse, harvester shed and a storage shed.

Let's talk about who Jennifer is. Jennifer is a very interesting and beautiful lady, from January 1994 to September 1995 she was in the Navy. She was an E-2 Electrician Mate. She was stationed at Washington State and lived in Bremerton. She also performed duties on the USS Camden. All her life she was around the military. She grew up as a military brat and lived in places like Yokota/Okinawa - Japan. In fact she graduated from high school in 1992 from Okinawa. She lived in Texas, Oregon, Florida, Charlevoix - Michigan from 99 to 2000 and once vacationed in Hawaii. She has been married twice and is now very happily married to a great guy named Tony and has two children named Cameron and Makayla. She has experienced the paranormal through her ex-sister-in-law Karen, who is a medium. (See article - Ghostbusters at the Old Historical Cemetery - which details her past paranormal experiences). Jennifer is a very enthusiastic young lady that has a sense of adventure. She loves driving Quads, she is set to take scuba diving lessons. Her other recreational activities include hiking, biking, swimming and reading good horror books.

She has a unique ancestry, she is quarter Japanese, quarter Taiwanese, Irish, French, American Indian - Senaca. Her favorite movie is Titanic and she always had a desire to be an actress. A song that she plays all the time is ""How Deep Is Your Love by the Bee Gees"" When relaxing in front of the TV, you will find her watching American Idol, So You Think You Can Dance, House, Sopranos, all of the CSIs and Gray's Anatomy. I was getting all of this information about Jennifer for this article, while Hannibal Rising movie was playing in the background. Jennifer was glued on this horror movie. Yep! I can tell she loves horror, she makes the perfect paranormal investigator! Jennifer has always had an interest in the paranormal, she thinks its in her DNA!

Now that I have told you everything about Jennifer, let's talk about our ghost hunting adventure. As we arrived at the clump of Eucalyptus trees, Jennifer worked her EVP (Electronic Voice Phenomenon) monitor. There is a lot of graffiti on the trees, probably placed there by my son's friends. Jennifer, Pika and I walk over to the historical site and again used the EVP monitor. Both Elk Grove areas look ""haunted"". The clump of trees swaying in the wind and the beckoning glow of the blue moon above us was frightening in itself. The historical site feels old. As we walked around this area, we felt a forbidding strangeness. I felt like I was walking in the past as images in my mind told me what was once there. As we stumbled around in the dark and Jennifer talking through her EVP monitor, we came across a gorgeous, but very dead white owl. We can see that it recently died, but the beauty of this dead owl made us both say...""ahhhhhhh"". We didn't see anything significant, so we headed back to my car, a 2003 Maroon Stratus that I affectionally call ""Ghost Tracker"" and headed out to the Sacramento Pocket Canal Area.

A little history about this place, the Pocket Area homes near the canal area were supposingly built over a Portuguese cemetery and it has been known that some of the Pocket homes are haunted and it has been documented and entered in a few books in regard to California hauntings. As Jennifer, Pika and I walked down the canal path next to these homes, we found a park next to the canal. We took several digital photographs and captured some orbs, but what was so surprising is that I took a picture towards the park and the picture showed a huge light image. Well, the strange thing is that where I positioned myself to take that picture, it was totally dark! Where did that light come from? I took a second picture at the same location and the picture was naturally dark. Jennifer takes a picture at the same location with her digital camera and it's still a naturally dark picture. So, where did this burst of light come from? Did a ghost make his or her presence known by coming directly to the lens of my camera as I took that picture? During my many haunting investigations I have taken a zillion pictures of orbs, I have seen other investigators take pictures of white mist, but never have I or any other investigators taken a picture of a burst of light in a totally dark area! As we walked away from this area, Jennifer got frightened twice, she heard a big fish hit the water and a goose in the background making a strange quacking sound. It was time to shut down this investigation, now it was time to get home and analyze what we found through the EVPs and photographs! I asked myself driving home, were these three areas credible for a future haunting investigation or were the two areas in Elk Grove where my son and his friends would party at, just a place where they imagined seeing a white mist, due to some wild partying and drinking unknown beverages? Who knows, Jennifer and I still had to check it out to make sure. The Pocket Area holds more credence, since many people who live in this area have said that their homes are haunted.

Jennifer and I seek out the unknown. When the unknown is searched out, the unknown will find you and reveal it's secrets. It's just a matter of time. As for the EVPs, we couldn't detect anything because of the wind, but we did get some unusual photographs in the Pocket Area. For more on H.P.I. (Haunted and Paranormal Investigations) of Northern California, check out their website at: www.HPIparanormal.net

Burst of light photograph taken in a naturally dark area - unexplained - Pocket Area.

More investigation needed under better environmental conditions.

Too much wind interference for EVPs. Pocket Canal Area has potential for paranormal activity due to unexplained photographs taken.

The Michele Stump Story:  Hauntings in El Dorado County,"California, United States",Ghost Hunting,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Ghost Hunting :: The Michele Stump Story:  Hauntings in El Dorado County

L ast night I went on a scouting mission with HPI Paranormal Investigator Jennifer Baca in Elk Grove. Today, June 2, 2007, Saturday, I am headed out on a historical scouting mission with HPI Paranormal Investigator Michele Stump. The only problem I am having today is that I didn't get enough sleep. I swallowed down some Starbucks, threw on some James Brown songs, such as Gravity, Living in America and Goliath to wake me up and take the long drive on Highway 50 to El Dorado County, where I would meet up with Michele Stump at Round Table Pizza in Placerville. Michele Stump is sort of a ghost historian of El Dorado County, she's read up on a lot of the areas that are supposingly haunted. She has taken the time to talk to the locals. So, today we are on a historical excursion. She will take me to various haunts and explain the history of these haunts in El Dorado County. We're not really trying to find a ghost or ghosts, even though she did bring her EVP (Electronic Voice Phenomenon) monitor. Just to let you know, we picked up no EVPs on this scouting quest.

Here are some of the places in Placerville that Michele showed me:

Placerville Historical Museum, which was once the Chamber of Commerce and the locals say that it's haunted by miners.

Cozmic Cafe: A ghostly black dog has been seen on the stairwell and there are miner caverns underneath this restaurant. You can actually enter the caverns and dine in the caverns. A lot of ghostly activity has taken place in the caverns in which patrons claim to have witnessed. Once when Michele walked into the caverns, she felt a tugging on her leg. There is some ghostly activity in the bar section too.

El Dorado County Chamber of Commerce: Once it was the Old Vet's Building in 1852. Then later it became the Kossuth House (Hotel) for the miners. More miner ghosts seen at this location.

Empire Antiques: Used to be a theater. Sometimes items at this store are moved around for no apparent reason.

Cary House: Supposed to be extremely haunted. The hotel elevator goes up and down on it's own. In the elevator sometimes there is the smell of cigar smoke. When Michele and I, entered the elevator we smelled the cigar smoke and then it was gone. Patrons have seen full body apparitions in the hotel. Sometimes the piano plays on its own. Two ghosts that are popular and have been seen is Stan the ghost, once an employee of the hotel. Another ghost sometimes seen by the stairs is of a young beautiful lady.

The Hangman's Tree Pub (Bar). Unique bar with dollar bills hanging from the ceiling. The actual hangman's tree is inside the bar. On a limb of the Hangman's tree is a rope. Outside is a dummy of a man hanging by his neck. Bloody 11Dick and two criminals were hanged from this tree. The 3 desperadoes faced no other than Judge Lynch. Altogether there were 4 hangings on this tree. Talked with an employee of this bar named Heather Mclean (Email to bar: Hangtree1 [at] hotmail [dot] com) and she says that sometimes the ice cream scooper moves on its own accord. Michele got dizzy inside this bar and had to step outside for some fresh air.

As we left Placerville and headed over to Georgetown. Michele relates to me that she once was a 911 Operator for the El Dorado County Sheriff's Department. She told me that at Green Valley Road by Shingle Springs, there were 6 ghostly horses galloping along the road and the sheriff was called out, when he arrived the horses disappeared. The story of the ghostly horses has been told before by other witnesses.

From here on out, are places that are haunted in Georgetown. Georgetown was once called Growlersburg, because the miners said that the gold nuggets were so big, that they had a growling sound when hitting the pan. Georgetown is an unusual little town. It's so small, people drive in the middle of the road and park their cars and walk to the bar. There is a rumor that a Chinese morgue is buried underneath the town. Now let's talk about some of the places we visited:

Georgetown Hotel. Sometimes items are moved around. Footsteps heard. The bar is very unusual, it has a real wasp nest hanging from the ceiling, stuffed heads of various animals, stuffed wolverine smoking a cigarette, strange signs, stuffed teddy bears, old pictures. A ghost named Verna haunts Room 5. Some ghostly kid and a ghostly old man make their appearances known ever once in a while.

Georgetown Volunteer Fire Department Building: A ghostly fireman with full uniform and hat sometimes stands outside of this building.

American River Inn: A woman fell from the 2nd balcony floor to her death and she appears at times on the 2nd floor. This hotel was built in 1863. Once when Michele visited this hotel, she used the bathroom and the bathroom door on its own accord flew open. Celebrities like David Hasselhoff (Knightrider fame), Ruth Buzzi and Carol Channing stayed at this hotel. People write their ghostly experiences in a big white photo album. I read some of them, they mostly take on religious overtones, where the patrons ask the ghosts to go towards the light. One famous ghost of this hotel is Oscar, a former patron of the hotel that seems to wander around here and there. Braundeline who works at this hotel has heard footsteps, when she looked to see who was walking down the floorway, there was no one there.

Shannon Knox House built in 1854 is the oldest residence in Georgetown. No ghostly activity has been recorded at this house. They should have a sign at this house saying...""this house is in a ghost free zone!""

Georgetown's Pioneer Cemetery established in 1848. Michele tries her EVP monitor. No EVPs recorded.

Greenwood Pioneer Cemetery established in 1852. According to Nancy Bradley, Psychic, she claims this is one of the most haunted cemeteries in El Dorado County. A lot of people who died in this cemetery invested into a railroad that never went through their town. Another interesting factor is that Placerville and Georgetown are the most haunted places in Northern California, according to residents. Michele receives no EVP readings at this cemetery.

The Bayley House. This 3 story mansion was formerly a hotel. It was built in 1862 by Assemblyman Alcander John (AJ) Bayley. Michele has investigated this mansion at night by herself and has captured orbs on her digital camera.

Sierra Nevada House. The ghost of politician Robert Chalmbers has been seen here. Michele's mom worked here as an employee and has witnessed bar stools spinning on their own. Shotglasses moving on their own. Robert Chalmbers who lived here, caught syphilis and went mad. His wife locked him in a room by himself, so he wouldn't hurt himself or others. Robert eventually died in that room.

Coloma Park: Where gold was discovered in the streams. Sometimes apparitions have been seen here.

Well, that's it! This was an interesting scouting mission on historical proportions. If you ever visit El Dorado County and want to do some ghost hunting, just follow my listing.

Retirement Home Spirit,"Utah, United States",Family / Friends Visits,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Family / Friends Visits :: Retirement Home Spirit

T hree years ago I worked in a very nice rest home as a CNA, it is called Courtyard at Jamestown assisted living facility, if anyone reading this is from Utah, it is just off university avenue right before will's pit stop. The people I helped there were near the end of their lives obviously, so we had a lot of people pass on there, but not a lot of them hung around there after they had died, so unusual occurrences were not the norm for the residents and staff. The residents got a hold of the CNA's by use of pull cords in their rooms that alerted us by a pager that would buzz and vibrate and show the room number of the person that needed help, or they had a necklace that had a button they could push to summon help. Now this is important to remember, the pull cords in the apartments had to be pulled with a fairly forceful tug to be activated and can only be reset by going into the room and pushing the little plastic switch attached to it back up.

A day prior to when this story occurred, one of our residents suddenly took a nose dive down hill and had to go to the hospital where she passed away that night, it was all very sudden, this lady Anna had been very healthy and active just a few days before. At the end of our shift, the day after she passed away, me and two other CNAs were sitting in the staff room charting, all the other CNAs had gone for the day as well as the RN and LPN that are there during the day time. So we were the only staff left in the building.

Our pagers started to buzz which in nothing out of the norm, until one of my co-workers pulled out her pager to see who needed us and realized the room that was calling was Anna's and she was dead, her face completely drained of color for a few seconds; we all thought this was a bit strange but sometimes the necklace call buttons malfunction so we figured that was probably what it was and decided just to go check her room, in case it was family that needed help moving her stuff out or some ordinary thing like that.

When we reached her room, the door was locked and the only ones with keys are the residents themselves and the nursing and housekeeping, this is important to keep in mind when reading what we found in the room. We unlocked the door and all the lights were off, then we noticed that the actual pull cord had been pulled down and that is what summoned us to that room, not a malfunctioning necklace call light.

After we got over our initial shock, we noticed that there were blankets and couch cushions strewn all across the living room and that it had not been like that when she had left for the hospital the day before (it could have been family but would you leave your mothers apartment all torn up?). At this point we were all getting a little freaked out, but someone had to reset the call light and that night I was not feeling at all like going into her room, so me and the other CNA ganged. Kristen and pushed her into the room and forced her to do it (not nice I know), she ran in and pushed the switch up and ran out almost tripping on a couch cushion in her haste to escape. We were all a little shaken and when the graveyard shift arrived, we told them what happened and they of course didn't believe us and as far as I know, nothing else ever happened in that room.

I think it was Anna just saying good bye to courtyard and the staff, she was a really fun lady who probably got a kick out of seeing us so scared.

The Confused Pilot,"Guam, United States",Apparitions / Voices / Touches,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Apparitions / Voices / Touches :: The Confused Pilot

I used to be stationed in Andersen AFB, Guam. I was working at a warehouse on grave shift (2200-0700). One night I was working the shift alone and I saw a pilot who was completely drenched. Even though there is usually no one around at that time of night, I didn't think much of it because he didn't really look like the traditional ""Hollywood version"" of a ghost. Also, he seemed a little more happy than I would think a ghost to be. I went up to him and asked if I could help him. He told me that he was looking for the rest of his crew and wanted to know if I would help him. I asked for some information (Mission number, aircraft tail number, etc.) so that I could look it up in our system. I wrote down what he told me and looked it up. Of course I found nothing so I went back to the man to apologize. He wasn't there, again I just thought it was kind of strange. Much to my liking, the rest of the shift went by quickly. When I got home, I emptied out my pants and found the paper where I had written the pilot's information, I decided to look it up on the internet. I believe it to be the mission talked about on this page:

It talks about a plane that crashed off the coast of Guam... In 1952.

Indian Ghosts,"Pennsylvania, United States",Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: Indian Ghosts

T his story I'm about to tell you happened when I was a toddler, and lived in Pennsylvania. I currently am 12 and live in Florida, so enjoy!

Encounter #1: My mom always told me that my sister and I used to talk to a boy named Ronald when we were younger. She is 17 now, and we both talked to him at the same age, and never talked about him to each other, yet still had the same name of the person when we told our mom. I remember waking up in the middle of the night and hearing some rustling going around in the basement, and people coming up and down the stairs. I went out there one night, with the curiosity of finding out who it was and saw nobody, but a really small light. Of course I didn't know what an orb was then, so I just crawled back to bed and forgot about it.

Encounter #2: My dad was about to go upstairs for the night, and our door was RIGHT in front of the steps. He was literally exactly next to the door when he heard a knock. He opened the door only a millisecond later, and found no one there. No one was running away, or hiding anywhere.

Encounter #3: We had a barn without any animals in it down the hill, because we lived on a mountain. It was ALWAYS locked, yet whenever we went down there, papers where everywhere. My dad used the upstairs and next room door as offices from his old job. They put a baby monitor down there to make sure no raccoons or anything were in there. Then they heard human footsteps in the barn. They thought they were the teenagers from down the street, so when they went down, the doors where still locked, and no windows were broken. No way to get in or out. When they checked, no one was in there, and there were the papers on the floor.

Encounter #4: This is the last encounter that happened at our house. It was around midnight, and my dad was out of town on a business trip. My sister was about 8 and I was 3. We used to live on an Indian battle ground, which is what we thought explained everything, but this put the icing on the cake. My mom woke up at midnight surely enough to the sound of an Indian battle fight. She thought it was the TV, so she looked up to turn it off, but that wasn't on. She checked all of the TVs, radios, and mass medias around the house, yet no sound was coming out if any. She still heard the fight. She didn't want to look out the window, because their was probably something out there from where she heard the yelling and hooves of horses.

Our Cat Jesse,"New York, United States",Pets / Animals,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Pets / Animals :: Our Cat Jesse

M y brother and I have 3 cats. Tasha (my cat) is a long haired Angora, Menew (My dad's cat) is a short hair Russian blue. And then there is Jesse. Jesse was my brother's cat, and she lived a long, happy life. She lived to be 17 (that's REAL old for a cat, if you believe in that dog years thing that applies for cats, she would of been 119 years old human years).

She was loved by all of us, and we would pet her, and we would love her as much as all the cats. Well, my cat Tasha is a little B*tch. She will attack any cat I pet. She would attack Jesse, and I think one day she really hurt her. Jesse would just lay on our floor and stay there. We knew she would die soon. We put food next to her, water and even my brother would sleep next to her. When she died, I was the last one petting her, and laying next to her. We buried her in my grandmother's backyard. My brother wrapped her in his favorite blue blanket. All our cats are girls, also. Even as I write this, although she died a year or two ago, I am crying like a little baby.

But one night, I was laying down and I felt a cat on the bed and I go to pet her, thinking it's my cat, and I feel nothing but warmth. I was sure it was jesse. I don't know why she came to me when she was Tyler's (my brother) cat. I felt comforted though, so I fell asleep. Then my brother got a new cat from my uncle, and he named it teddy (our first boy cat). It was scary. The kitten looked just like Jesse when she was younger. We got him spaded (neutered) and he would go to the bathroom all over. We brought him to the pound, with everyone crying, and we ended up getting him back, since we couldn't take it. After that, I saw him meowing to another cat, and there was not one there. After that, he stopped going all over.

Growling and the Rosary Prayer,Ireland,Non Human Entities,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Non Human Entities :: Growling and the Rosary Prayer

T he story I am about to unfold occurred in November 2005. It was just a normal Friday night. As I had planned to meet friends the following evening, I spent the night at home watching T.V. and in general just relaxing. About midnight, I decided to go to bed. On this particular evening just my father and I were at home. Since he had gone to bed earlier it was my responsibility to turn off all the lights and lock up the house. On my way to bed, I passed the holy water font and blessed myself. This was a nightly habit and nothing out of the ordinary.

At this stage in the story I must point out that I am a practicing catholic. My religious beliefs play an important role in my day to day life. That said, I do not publicly show this. Put simply, it is between my savior Jesus Christ and me.

Soon I was tucked up in bed. As an avid reader, I was reaching out for a book to enjoy, when a little booklet of the Holy Rosary caught my eye. It is important to note that the week prior to this, I had kept hearing about the wonderful graces given by Our Blessed Lady for reciting the Rosary in her honor. Although claiming to be religious and well versed in such matters, the Rosary was one prayer that confused me as a child, well that and the fact that is was so long. For these reasons, it was never on my prayer agenda but for some unknown reason, I felt required to say it. As already stated, I did not know how to go about it correctly though.

So during Saturday evening mass I mentally said to Jesus ""If you want me to say it just give me a sign!"" All was forgotten until just after mass, when I was waiting on my Grandmother who was receiving confessions. Whilst waiting, I looked at some fresh flowers placed in front of an image of Our Lady when to my astonishment, a step by step guide on how to say the Rosary was resting beside it (having gone to this church for all of my 24 years I had never seen such a leaflet!). I took the guide home with me and that night said it in its entirety for all the holy souls in purgatory.

My good intentions soon diminished until that Friday night. Seeing the booklet and taking my rosary beads in hand, I started it again. At 4.45am I awoke to my doorbell continuously ringing. I had obviously fallen asleep whilst saying it. At my door, I found my older sister a little worse for wear. She had been out at her work Christmas party and in the merriment had mislaid her key. I let her in and helped her to bed, while she told me of all the office scandal. Not wanting to wake my father as she was a little loud, I informed her that she would have to fill me in on all the gossip the following morning. Now I found myself wide awake as I went back to my own room. I switched on my stereo to a low volume, switched off the light and climbed happily into what was earlier a warm bed.

I closed my eyes, plumped my pillow and pulled up my duvet to my neck in anticipation of a snug sleep. In the background, I could hear a song being played that was the cheesy hit of the previous summer. I was contemplating how come such a song would be so popular when all of a sudden I heard the most terrifying sound of my life. In the darkness of my room, about ten inches from my face, I heard the most terrible growling in my entire life. It was so loud that I was sure that at any moment my father and sister would run into my room. My eyes were clamped shut in fear and my heart beating out of my chest.

Although I did not see what was there, the image in my head was that of a snarling evil dog. I felt pure evil that night; this evil had descended upon my room and like the darkness was enveloping me. My immediate cry for help was to recite the Our Father aloud while blessing myself over and over again. I don't know when the growling stopped for sure. It was probably when I blessed myself. What I do know is that I got up and switched the light on as soon as possible and for the rest of that night, said prayers until I drifted to sleep with the light on.

I would like to say that there is no way I was dreaming when I heard this sound. I was completely awake and aware of my surroundings. Looking back, I feel it was the Devil that visited me that night. I believe that somehow this experience was related to me saying the Rosary. I believe that the rosary is a powerful prayer, one that the devil does not want us to use against him. This is only one supernatural experience of many that has occurred to me but it is one that I hope will give hope to others of the power and protection of God.

Be our protection against the wickedness and snares of the devil.

Thank you for reading. Opinions on this would be much appreciated.

Man on my Back,"Washington, United States",Old Hags / Night Attacks / Sleep Paralysis,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Old Hags / Night Attacks / Sleep Paralysis :: Man on my Back

O ne night when I was about to go to sleep and my lights turned off, I didn't think much of it so I just brushed my teeth and laid on my bed. I watched some TV before going to sleep. It was late around 2 in the morning, so I turned off my tv and fell asleep. Usually I like to sleep on my stomach, I don't know why, but I do.

So maybe an hour or two later, I felt someone lean their weight on my back and I couldn't breath. My dad is a heavy guy so I thought it might be him telling me to get up or something. So I tried to turn around and tell him to get off, but I couldn't move, I couldn't breath and I was really cold and-scared. Nothing scares me, but I was scared so I laid there maybe about a minute, then I got the strength to turn around. When I did, there was nothing but footsteps around my room, I heard them. I was scared out of my mind, I didn't know what to do, I tried to shout to my mom or my dad, but I was speechless, nothing came out of my mouth when I tried to shout.

When it all ended, I ran into my parents bedroom, petrified, speechless and cold. To this day I haven't told them why their 15 year old son ran into their bedroom like a 6 years old girl.

Dream of a Screaming Shadow,"Oregon, United States",Old Hags / Night Attacks / Sleep Paralysis,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Old Hags / Night Attacks / Sleep Paralysis :: Dream of a Screaming Shadow

O ne night while I was sleeping, I had a very strange dream. I was dreaming about a very annoying guy I used to go to school with. My dream consisted of many flashes of images of me talking to him and being very annoyed like always. At the end of the dream, I was holding a cake at my senior all night party and I was standing in a crowd of people, I was trying to find a place to set this very heavy cake down. When I thought I had finally found a place to set the cake dow,n the very annoying guy was standing in my way.

I shouted to him, telling him to move but he wouldn't, so I continued shouting at him, telling him how fed up I was with him. He had been bugging me all night and I was sick of it. But he just kept on, he told me he couldn't move because he just couldn't and that was that.

Just when I thought I was going to drop the cake all over the floor, a shadow appeared behind me and gave out this shrill harsh scream, it consisted of a series of screams and grunts that I still can't describe very well.

I woke up right then and couldn't move, I tried to move my feet and kick, but I couldn't I tried to turn my head and see what it was but I could hardly breath. I moved my eyes slightly to try and see what it was, but all I saw was a shadow. I couldn't hear my own thoughts or anything beside the screaming, then I began to breath heavily to try and hear my self and after a few seconds, I could move again.

After that, I felt like something was following me, and I couldn't stop thinking about what happened. Things have calmed down a bit since then but it's still not the same as it was.

Don't Get Involved with Ouija Boards,"New Jersey, United States",Ouija Board / Seances,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Ouija Board / Seances :: Don't Get Involved with Ouija Boards

T his ghost story about the ouija board. It's very true! My friend Lyndsay came over to my house to play the ouija board with me, because you're not supposed to play alone! So she came over and we asked to talk to Heather Midsin. Heather Midsin was a girl that was into devil worshiping. She used to live on my road. She hung herself because she was in a cult. My neighbor heard that I was using a ouija board and warned me about it! I said ""yeah right what could possibly happen"", well I was in for a fright! Don't think I'm kidding around with you this is the truth!

So my friend was over and we got out the ouija board. Last time I used it my mom locked it up in the shed because she got so scared of what my neighbor said. We asked for Heather Midsin and it did nothing. We asked it again and again and again. After a while we finally got it to work. We asked why it wasn't talking at first and then it said that it got mad at me for locking it up in my shed. Then I said ""it wasn't me it was my mom"". Heather replied ""I don't care, I hate you, I'm going to kill you and your friend"". Then my friend and I got so scared. Heather told us to open the front door to get a surprise or die. We didn't open the front door because we were so scared. We asked her where she was and she said in my dog. We looked in my kitchen at my dog and my dog growled at us. Then the cabinet opened and we ran back to the ouija board.

Heather loved black magic. We asked her if she was good she said, ""HELL NO"". Then we got even more scared. She said she was a devil. She said that on March 7, she went inside of me to find out more about me. That day she was inside of me, she made me fall. It hurt so badly. She made me get in a lot of trouble. I should have never gotten involved with a devil! Now she won't ever leave me alone! I have to be careful! She possessed me once she can do it again!

NEVER GET YOURSELF INVOLVED WITH A OUIJA BOARD! PLEASE I'M TELLING YOU THIS SO YOU DON'T GET HURT! BE CAREFUL!

God Manifesting as Orbs,"Texas, United States",Orbs / Lights / Mists,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Orbs / Lights / Mists :: God Manifesting as Orbs

O n August 12 or 13, 2004, I had been watching the Perseid meteor shower with my friends and children in a rural community on the outskirts of Houston, Texas. I was not drinking nor was I using any drugs. Things had slowed down after a few hours and everyone went into my home.

I walked back out into my front yard by myself. All the lights were still out from watching the meteor shower, and the only light was from the kitchen area of my house, which I could see behind the drapes. That's it... Other than that it was very dark outside.

Suddenly, these balls of light appeared (the ""orbs"" that so many people are photographing), they were the size of softballs and some were clear and some were opaque and many shades in between.

My first thought was that I had something on my glasses, some moisture that was causing a visual anomaly, and so I took my glasses off and began cleaning them with my shirt. As I did this, I noticed of course that I could still see the orbs and that it was not a smudge or something causing the effect.

My next thought was that I was having some sort of brain aneurysm... I mean, the balls of light were everywhere and were swirling around... I thought that it was a hallucination. But then I saw that the balls of light were literally illuminating an outbuilding that I was about 25' from. Imagine a thousand unseen children playing with flashlights... That is what it looked like as the lights shown on the walls of the building.

Okay, I know how this next part sounds. I know that it sounds crazy, and I have questioned my sanity many times since this, particularly with all that has followed. I may well be crazy, but I swear on my soul that I am telling the truth. I was a practicing attorney when this happened. I have given up the law, and given up most of what I owned (several homes, boats, other properties, etc.,) because this was the most important event of my life... And I want to understand it.

Suddenly, I knew that I was in the presence of god. I was an agnostic who was actually just a lazy atheist who did not feel like arguing with people about it. I knew that god was just an invention, and that everything could be explained scientifically.

In that moment, I knew absolutely that I was wrong. I knew that I was in the presence of god... And I felt so ashamed. I also felt this INTENSE love, something so strong and pure that it is difficult to describe, emanating from the presence... Pure love. Pure compassion. Pure adoration.

I began telling god that She/He (it seemed androgynous) had made a terrible mistake, that I was not worthy of this love that I was being showered with... I told god that I was a bad person and that I was maybe one of the worst people ever. I literally said ""You must be lost. You have the wrong girl... you're at the wrong house..."" and in hindsight, I cannot believe that I told god She/He was lost... But I think that She/He was a little amused by it, because there was a great tenderness and ultimate understanding and compassion in the voice that then said to me ""I created you... I am you...""

Now that is an exact quote. I can relate the rest of what was said to me, but I cannot give an exact quote. I was told that I had come from the stars (or ""out there"") and that I would be ""coming home"" soon. I was also told that I had once been a part of all the love and lights that was surrounding me, and that I would be a part of it again.

Then something fell through the limbs of the oak tree behind me and I was startled (remember, I had been watching meteors earlier) and ran inside. When I realized that what I had heard was most likely an acorn I walked back outside but the lights were gone.

That was not the first supernatural event I have witnessed, but it was the first time that I could not just say ""oh, that must have been my imagination""...and it was definitely the first in a long series of EXTREMELY bizarre events.

Small Ugly See-Through Creature,Australia,Non Human Entities,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Non Human Entities :: Small Ugly See-Through Creature

H i, I'm a 20 years old male from Australia, grew up in a muslim family, but stopped believing religion when I had feelings for same sex. I don't usually hear about ghost, never even had interested of hearing it until today. The reason I am writing this right now is because this morning something happened that I cannot explain.

It was 10am in the morning and I was still asleep, my mum came in my room and tried to wake me up, I didn't responded to her so she touched me to see if I had a fever (wanted to know why I was still asleep). After she touched me, she left the room, and seconds after I felt a presence of something else, and weird noises. I knew it wasn't mum nor my brother, but for some reason I wanted to believe it was them, so I told them to exit, but something still walked towards me and touched me on my feet.

It was the weirdest and most uncomfortable feeling and was a mix between electric and paralyzing touch, it freaked me out but I couldn't get up to see what it was, I was trying to scream but nothing came out, It was moving slowly towards my face and I just manage to see it, it was a small black thing. I can't describe the looks but it was ugly and see-through, what ever it was, it was nothing anyone I knew had seen before. It was as tall as a 6 years old, and from what I remember, it was a bold thing, I kept trying to move and scream but I couldn't, and it made real weird noises, I can't describe how, but sounded more like that noise you get when you turn on the hot tap, not exactly but its similar enough that I can't turn on the hot water tap without getting shivers.

I don't know how but it ended up leaving and I manage to scream, I still wasn't able to scream as loud as I wanted to but I yelled enough to bring my family to my bedroom, after talking to them for hours, I went to have shower, I turned on hot water and a similar noise was there, I was freaked out and turned off the water, and the same noise was still there. I screamed and ran outside...

That was a proof to me that it wasn't just a dream, I am now freaked out going to sleep in case I see it again, I cannot believe what I have seen and I don't know what to do, if anyone experienced what I experienced I would love to talk to you about it.

Are Ghosts Contacting Me?,Jordan,A Haunted Life,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: A Haunted Life :: Are Ghosts Contacting Me?

D ear all, I'd love to share my unexplained stories with you... I've been always seen ghosts, spirits, devils! I will write more than one story that had happened to me, so advise me what would you think they are, and what should I do. I had a brother one year older than me, so when I was 4 years old (he was 5) he entered the kindergarden (preschool), we were so close, he didn't want to go alone, he always wanted me to be with him. So my mother registered me with him in the same class.

One day the teachers took us (all the kids) to the theater of the school to play on the stage, so we all went back between the black curtains and the wall and we all saw a devil laughing, it was on a thing ""board"" and going up! We all screamed and run out, as we all saw the same thing. Now I'm 21 and when I asked my brother about it and if he still remembers that, he told me that he never experienced it, and don't know what I was talking about! Is it possible that he forgot?! Or it was a dream of mine when I was a little child and later start to believe it was real and had happened?

Another strange story, I was maybe 15, no one was in the house, everyone was out in the garden, so I went inside to bring something when I looked up on the stairs, I saw a large angel standing, but its wings were beside it as ""not flying"". It didn't look like how it is made in the movies, it has no color (as water)! I was so scared and run quickly outside. What was that?

Another story, THIS ONE IS SCARY AND EERIE! I was 17, it was summer, I was a bit sick and had a fever, when I was asleep, I suddenly woke up, but unfortunately couldn't open my eyes (it was still midnight)! Though I tried hardly to open my eyes but I couldn't. I tried to scream, ask for help, or even call my parents, but I also couldn't! That thing was tightening me! Then I felt it holding my legs so tight and it started shaking me (from my legs) and at that point I started praying ""remembering a holy verse from my holy book, that I have heard once that reading this verse will let all bad evils go away"". So I start reading it and I felt that thing ""THE DEMON"" let go my legs and stop shaking me, and finally I could open my eyes! But because I was so scared by then, I didn't try to look to where it supposed be standing (beside my legs), I only looked out of the window, thanked God and covered my self! What was that?

Another thing, when he was 9, my little brother used to see my grandfather (who was dead), but my grandpa didn't talk to him, he was dressed in white, flying ... And then went through the wall! He saw him more than once! And once a friend came to sleep in our house so she slept in the basement and one day she told me that she saw my grandpa visiting her in the room she slept in! She was frightened by then and crying!

By the way, our house is new, we built it... And another thing, my grandpa died before we moved in the house! So tell me what are these? What shall I do?

Haunted Apartment,"Kentucky, United States",Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: Haunted Apartment

W e live in an apartment, we have have lived here for 6 years now. We have never heard anything or we have not really been listening. But for the last 3 nights, my husband got woken up by something touching his hand. The next night I was asleep, he was up watching tv and something pulled my shirt, it woke me up, I asked him what he wanted, he said nothing. I asked ""why did you pull my shirt for then?"" He said ""I never touched you or anything"". I let it go.

Last night our floor was popping as if someone was walking on it. No one was up. It woke me up. Do you think we have a ghost? Nothing has ever happen here. But my sister did her cards and she said we had 2 men ghost and a women ghost. She said the 2 men are kind to us but she don't know who the women are, they have asked her to go away. What can you all tell me about this? Is it just me or is there something here?

My son said he has seen a light in the hall in the shape of a person. My girl said said she has seen the women and she was dressed in black. And when we go out, we get phone calls and the answering system go off, there is a women on there talking, we can't get over it. She answers our phone. She tells people that they have the wrong phone number. Then when we call them, they ask us who is the women picking up our phone, we told them it was our friend the ghost, we joke about it. What do you all think about this I would love to know?

Morningside Road,"Minnesota, United States",Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: Morningside Road

M orningside Road was Morningside Farm back in the day. I believe a family had to deal with a few deaths on this farm and they are still present today. The first is a man that walks around the house I grew up in. He used to show himself to my brother before he would go to bed and he would stand in the kitchen all night long. He would leave me little gifts, like confetti and other small items around my room. I have felt his presence while I was laying in bed. I woke up in the middle of the night unable to move and I could see him standing off in the corner.

There is also a little boy that shows up now and then. He throws things, turns on lights, radios, TVs, etc, and misplaces items we are looking for. We don't feel any harm from him and let him be.

These incidents have died down since my brother and I moved out of the house. My mom still lives there but rarely experiences anything anymore. Every once in awhile, when we are all home visiting, we'll get a little treat from both of the spirits to let us know they are still hanging around. It's fun and we have never felt threatened by them. Although, I refuse to go into a certain corner in our basement. Each time I do have to go into the basement to do laundry, I can feel someone watching and it is very cold. I have felt this way about that corner of the basement since I can remember. I stay far away from that part of the house.

My Niece's Possession,Ecuador,Demons / Possessions / Exorcisms,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Demons / Possessions / Exorcisms :: My Niece's Possession

M y story takes place in Guayaquil, Ecuador (I'm from there)... I was spending part of my summer there, about the second week I was there visiting my family, when things started to happened. One night my niece just started feeling sick and we took her to the doctor but the doc said that she just had a cold. But we didn't think so, we knew something else was going on, but we didn't know what it was...

At that night around 11:00 pm we heard my sister screaming and saying to let her go, when we got to the room, we saw someone holding her from behind and I saw my niece turning into some purple green color and she had a really low pulse. My sister started praying but then something else happened, our bathroom door opened and a man walked out from there and said it'll be over soon... My grandmother went to the bathroom and she saw bones, like dead person bones and she took it outside the house and then everything went calm again. Everyone felt comfortable in the house, but I didn't because I still did felt scared. Even after the second time I went there, I still felt scared... And this shiat really happened and I was only 14 years old.

If you want to find out, just let me know probably if you can afford to travel all the way over there, you can come by my place over there and find out for your self, beside my house is not the only haunted one in my neighborhood.

Portal to Hell,"New York, United States",A Haunted Life,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: A Haunted Life :: Portal to Hell

L og line: When a flaming demon steps through a portal in the teenage Reynaldo Reyes's living room in Brooklyn, N.Y. It's just the first of a series of frightening encounters and unexplained deaths, including that of the well-known rapper Jam Master Jay of Run DMC. This is the bizarre true story of a life-long struggle with the supernatural/horror.

If Poltergeist was a graphic novel set to rap music, you would have the life of Reynaldo Reyes. Welcome to his neighborhood in Brooklyn, N.Y. Where the front stoops are littered with sorcerers, back stabbers, blackmailers, criminal conspirators, and welfare families. Where rappers Run DMC are involved in a bizarre mystery. When he is a teenager, a series of strange events culminate in a fright night: the kitchen blazes with flames that don't burn, ""something"" steps through the ring of fire, and Reynaldo's reaction is so severe he is rushed to the hospital.

Whatever entity came through that night, it doesn't leave. It harasses Reynaldo and frightens others in the building. His behavior changes, often for the worse. There are arguments, physical fights, and trouble with the police. Violence swirls around him. At the same time, the deeply religious Reynaldo has confusing visions of heaven and hell, as well as the future. For example, he suddenly and frantically announces that terrorists are going to blow up the Empire State Building. No one believes him. Three days later, terrorists attack the World Trade Center.

Soon after Reynaldo creates a rap song about three apparitions he experienced over a four-year period, he has premonitions in which a mysterious deity speaks to the well-known lead singer of the rap group Run DMC and starts a rumor that inspires the group's 1986 hit album ""Raising Hell..."" Less than a month after Reynaldo's book is accepted for publication, Jam Master Jay of the rap group Run DMC is murdered in what Reynaldo strongly believes is a supernatural crime cover-up. His book is published on July 1, 2003, precisely one year after Jam Master Jay's death. Today the killers have not been captured, and the death remains unsolved. Nor have the demons left Reynaldo alone.

Reynaldo Reyes is a freelance artist. His designs have appeared on T-shirts and his commissioned paintings hang in St. Thomas Catholic Church and the Parapsychology Foundation. He has been interviewed at length by internationally renowned paranormal researcher John Zaffis for his TV show and for Zaffis's documentary, which is shown around the country.

Two Men in White in the Labor Room,"Michigan, United States",Misc,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Misc :: Two Men in White in the Labor Room

I n August of 1992 I found out I was pregnant with my daughter Dominique, who is now 14 years old of age. I had just graduated from high school. I really can't remember but some months later, I thought something was wrong with the pregnancy and I had my mother's friend pray for me, I guess she told her church members and they all prayed for me and my baby.

My mother came to me one day and said that her friend said hello and that everything that I was worried about was going to be okay, and by the way you're having a girl. I just looked at my mother and said, ""how in the world would she know that"", my mother said to me that god told her friend that. I didn't take her serious at all. When the time came for me to deliver on May 15, 1993, my mother's friend was right.

As my daughter was coming out I saw two male angels standing in front of me both wearing white suits, they where standing in front of me as I laid on the table giving birth. The one angel standing the closest to me was about 5ft 9in and the other one was about 6ft 9in which he was standing behind him. No one else in the room noticed this, not even the nurses and the doctors, just me. I thought I was having an nervous breakdown, or fell asleep. I blinked my eyes and realized that I wasn't crazy or asleep. I thought this was the most beautiful thing I have ever witnessed and experienced. The whole delivery room was so bright and very warm, the feeling was like I was sitting in a nice warm tub of water enjoying a bath.

Instantly I thought of my mother's friend who's church prayed for me and my daughter. Ever since then I have had so many blessing throughout raising my daughter, I believe the angels came down to make sure my daughter made it on time and safely. I have only shared this story with three other people in my life.

My Old Blue House,"Ohio, United States",Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: My Old Blue House

T his story happened in August of 2006. The house my husband, son, and I where living in, the ceiling came down in the living room in July. We were staying at his mother's house when this occurred.  My friend Lisa and I were at my house cleaning it out. Packing stuff so when we moved, the stuff was packed for us. We were working on packing the stuff in the kitchen and putting the boxes in the living room where the ceiling had feel.

Lisa did not like my bathroom because she has had bad experiences in it. A friend and I were playing a joke on her, one day when she used the bathroom and held the door shut went she was trying to get out and when we let go of the door, I was still being held firmly and would not move for anyone. I ended up kicking the door and I opened. So from that day on, she will not use the bathroom without the door being open and someone near the door.

When we where packing, she had to use the bathroom and she had me stand guard at the door as usual. She used the potty and went to go wash her hands when she noticed speckled blood all over the cover of my sink top. There was even finger marks in it. She called me in there to look at it and we both looked at each other like WTF. She washed her hands and we decided maybe it could have been an animal or a bird that did it, since no one was living there now. So we cleaned it up. We packed a few more boxes and we both went home.

The next day we went down there so we could pack some more. Lisa got the idea to check to see if the blood was back in the same pattern with the finger marks. Sure enough, we went back into the bathroom and there it was.

This went on for a month. I don't think an animal can do that over and over again and one day stop. That house was and still is creepy. We thought maybe the inhabitants were mad because I moved out. I still reside on the same property. I actually live right next to the house. And we are working on tearing it down. I am wondering what it is going to go when it's gone.

My friends and I are going to do a little investigation before we take the house down and I update you all on the results. I have a lot more stories of the house too.

Strange Things That Happened to Me 1,"Texas, United States",Psychic / Medium,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Psychic / Medium :: Strange Things That Happened to Me 1

E ver since I can remember, I've always been interested in the paranormal, that is, ghost stories and the like. I think my earliest memory of my interest had to do with my dad whom I would have read ""scary"" stories to me before bedtime. Actually, I would say my interest began with my dad, who had a few scary stories to tell me about his past.

The first thing (I was probably 4-6 years old) I can remember happening to me that was even remotely odd had to do with my dad. I was very attached to him when I was growing up and I think because of this attachment this odd thing happened. Right before he would arrive home, I would see him walking in the dining room towards me and I would tell my mom that he was coming home. What was so strange about this was that what I would see was an image of him made of light walking and it was completely transparent. After I saw this image he would pull up in the driveway. I have no idea why I remember this or even if my mom believed me or remembers me telling her this.

Let's skip ahead to when I was in college. I met a few people who were interested in the same things as me as far as the paranormal goes. Quite a few things happened while I was friends with them. I am going to refer to them as Tim and Bob.

A little about Tim and Bob before I continue. Tim claimed to have control of spirits, and was followed around by one, which I believe the latter. He also played around with things he shouldn't have, which is probably why he was followed around and stuff happened around him. Bob on the other hand seemed to only be able to see auras. I really don't know if I believe this or not, but this is just a background tidbit anyway.

One time I was at my house with Tim and we played around with a Ouija board (and yes I am quite aware of what they are, the potential dangers that are involved with them. I haven't touched one since these incidences anyway, which was about 8 years ago) Of course nothing happened. I've tried it before with my dad and nothing happened. In fact, my curiosity which drove me to play with this thing was the fact nothing ever seemed to happen to my satisfaction, not just with the board but anything, but I digress.

Tim said he saw a lady in brown that was standing next to us, and of course I didn't see or sense anything. I've concluded I wouldn't be able to sense a brick wall even if I ran into it face first. I decided to just let it go at that and we were done since it was getting pretty late and the board never moved or anything.

Tim and I were laying in the dark in my room and I was doing what I did sometimes, which was to just stare into the darkness and watch the shadows move or listen to the sounds of night. I pointed out to Tim that I was seeing little orbs of light, he said he saw them too. This is something not unusual to me and I found it pleasant that someone else could see them too.

This went on for a few minutes when suddenly the room turned blue. I can't describe it in any other way - the shadows. The walls and ceiling seemed tinged with blue. I asked Tim if it seemed like the room was blue to him as well and he said yes. After this a couple more orbs floated around, larger white ones and I was starting to get kind of nervous because Tim asked ""Can you feel the cold spot that is moving around above us?"" I raised one hand into the air and sure enough, something passed around my hand cold, normal, cold, normal. I quickly pulled my hand down and I just lay there frozen not really knowing what to think.

Then Tim heard something in the living room, which was right next to my room. He told me to listen. We went quiet and I heard faint voices talking, a male and a female, and also I heard the faint sound of a radio playing. I couldn't believe it. I knew no one was awake, my parents had long since gone to bed and we were the only two up. I looked at the clock and it said it was 3 am.

Finally we both got up to investigate the living room and the adjoining kitchen where the only radio that could have been playing could be. The living room was pitch black and quiet as was the kitchen. I still don't know what happened that night.

Another time Tim and I were house-sitting his parents house for the weekend. His house is in the middle of the woods somewhat in the middle of nowhere. He has told me before about something that waits outside on the deck for him when he comes home and then races off into the woods when he gets out of his car and has said there have been weird things that happen when he was alone or when everyone else was asleep. This night was to be no different.

He decided that we should watch really bad horror ""B"" movies in his sister's room on her PS2 since she had a nice TV and I guess he watched to do the whole camp out on the floor thing. Everything was perfectly normal besides the movie until around 1 am.

The family dog, Barley, ran into the room and then started barking while looking straight at me. I was confused because I was only sitting there watching the movie and I knew she wasn't barking at that. Tim told her to go away and stop making so much noise, but he still insisted on barking at me.

I tried to get her to come to me so I could comfort her because she really seemed freaked out. She would begin to crawl on her belly towards me but then she would back up quickly barking and sort of growling. She started to run in and out of the room and after watching her for a bit I noticed she wasn't looking at me but behind me. I turned and looked at the blinds on the windows and one of them was moving. I looked up at the ceiling and the fan wasn't on, in fact the air was perfectly still and I pointed this out to Tim. Then we heard something like stomping in the rooms above us which really scared me and Tim seemed to be nervous too. We ended up looking upstairs and outside since Tim said he heard something stomping around in the dead leaves in the woods, but we could never find out what had made those sounds.

My last story for now involves me, Tim and Bob. We were at Bob's efficiency apartment for the night, and we weren't really doing anything; I was working on an art project and Tim and Bob were playing some video game.

I was getting pretty bored with being left out and I asked them if they wanted to play with the Ouija board which had been living in the trunk of Tim's car all this time. They said yeah sure and Tim went to get it out of his car and we sat around it to see what would happen.

Nothing happened, as I expected, and after a while we got bored again.

Now remember what I said about Tim being more deeply involved with this type of thing. Well, Tim decided to do something odd. He was always telling me about chakra points and how to open them and how to channel energy in and out of your body for different effects. Since nothing worked for me I never really took anything he said to me completely seriously. Tim decided to apply this knowledge to the apartment building. He put his hands on the walls and said he was drawing energy from the entire building. Bob seemed concerned and was telling Tim that he probably shouldn't do that because something might happen - who knows what sort of energies he would pull from the building. To me this sounded ridiculous.

After Tim finished he went into the bathroom and came out a few minutes later looking somewhat horrified. Bob and I asked him what was wrong and he said, ""I looked into the mirror and my face wasn't my own, it was like it kept changing and morphing..."" He forbid me to go into the bathroom, but Bob went into there to look and said yeah, something is wrong, my face was changing too. After a while Tim commented that there was something that he described as a vortex about the ceiling fan and that it had opened up when he was drawing energy from the building, and that also things were starting to come through that vortex into the room. I couldn't see anything, but I did notice that the bed was shaking on its own as well as the blinds on the windows.

The things that Tim saw, which he described as rather weak, dark, energy sucking things that were bent and whose limbs were pointed at the ends of the appendages and the face, were hiding in bathroom where it was completely dark. He said they wouldn't come out until we turned off the light. I can't remember exactly who did this, but Bob or Tim pulled the switch on the fan light and the room went dark. This only lasted a few minutes when the light was pulled back on and Tim said we weren't going to turn off the light again.

Bob started to act funny and complained about a pain in his neck like something was sitting on his shoulders or neck, and Tim was saying he had pains on his back. I am not sure but I believe I could see something like a greenish presence where they said they were hurting and when I touched those places, they were icy cold while the surrounding flesh was warm and normal.

Finally Tim had enough of this and said we were leaving since he was worried something might happened to me. I told him we should probably stay with Bob in case something might happen to him since nothing had happened to me the entire night. Bob said he would be OK and we left.

When we got back to my house, I took a look at Tim's back and I was shocked. I said ""Tim, did you know you have a lot of bad scratches all over your back?"" and he said ""No, I didn't know"" and he went to look in the mirror. The way the scratches were on his back there was no way that he could have done it himself. That was the last time we played with the board or did anything like that again.

I apologize about the length, I tend to be very detailed when I write anything. I hope those of your who read this enjoy the stories. Read part 2 .

Strange Morning,"Florida, United States",Apparitions / Voices / Touches,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Apparitions / Voices / Touches :: Strange Morning

L ast night I fell asleep on the mattress on the floor of the tv room, I wanted to watch tv and fell asleep. Later I woke up and all the lights and television were off, probably because my mom or step-dad turned them off, and it was about 3:00am.

I was awakened by a loud sound, I heard someone say something, but I don't remember, then there was a loud crash and I think the electricity went out because I didn't hear the fridge or anything making sound. I wasn't sure if that was a dream or not, but it looked like my dog, who was sleeping next to me, heard it. I was scared and confused as to what happened. Then after a few minutes, the fridge was making sound again and such.

Then I saw my dog, Peanut, who is a playful little dog, she took her dollie and looked into the kitchen and she did the thing to show she wanted to play, she seemed happy, too, she was creeping me out and I didn't want to see what she was looking at. I just called her over to keep me company because I was scared.

Peanut went wandering off into the hall way and I sat at the end of the mattress, looking into the kitchen, just a dark kitchen with no one in it. I was just waiting for Peanut to come back so I can cuddle with her to help stop me from being scared. Then I heard the french doors in the entry way rattling, then they opened, I looked into the entry way (which wasn't far from me) hoping to see one of my brothers come out (they like to use the room beyond those doors), but no one came out, so I was a little creeped out and confused.

Peanut came back and I watched television with her and things seemed normal for a while. I saw the light from my computer screen shining through the french doors into the entry way (my room is next to the room with the french doors), I thought I saw a shadow in front of the light, I thought that maybe my little sister was on my computer since I left it on for her to use if she wanted to. I got up, went to the entry way, looked through the french doors to see into my room, but there was no one in there or in the room where I heard the french doors open.

When the sun started rising, I wanted to come on my computer to listen to music, chat, and read, so I brought Peanut into my room with me because I was still a little scared. It was 6:30am and I was on my computer, having fun, then I heard someone humming in my kitchen, I was excited, thinking it was my mom about to leave for work. The kitchen is right next to my room... I excitedly went into the kitchen to greet her, but to find no one, I looked in the hall way and tv room, but everyone else was still in their rooms, so I was curious.

I went back to my computer and heard someone walking in my kitchen, I wanted to see if it was my mom or sister or at least someone, but there was no one there when I went out, I checked my little sister's room, but she was still asleep. So I'm wondering what that was all about.

Strange Things That Happened to Me 2,"Texas, United States",Psychic / Medium,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Psychic / Medium :: Strange Things That Happened to Me 2

I would like to continue from my first submission, the first part of these stories, Strange Things That Happened to Me 1 . These are fairly recent and happened about a year ago when another friend of mine, Dawn, moved in with me and my husband, Scott.

I'd like to give a little background on Dawn before I continue. Dawn is my psychic friend that I mentioned in my first submission, and I've been friends with her since I was 18 years old. As long as I've known her she has always told me about strange things that have happened to her since she was a child. Also, as long as I have known her, she is always moving around the country due to some circumstance or another, and never stays in one place for very long.

It was because of one of these circumstances that Dawn came to live with Scott and I in November 2005. I was very excited about her coming to live with us since I was sure I would get to experience at least something strange or weird.

When Dawn arrived here, she immediately settled in and told me a few things about the place that Scott and I lived in (and still live in). She said that she sensed a few spirits around and also said she did not like the living room and would not go in there at night. She felt so uncomfortable that she insisted in smudging the entire house and placing crystals in the four outer most corners. After she did this, everything seemed to be OK to her, as she seemed to be at ease in the living room and didn't complain about it anymore.

Now I am not entirely sure what happened, but the smudging didn't seem to work. Soon Dawn would tell me she would hear things tapping on the wall of her room and that she heard something strange growling right outside her window (the window is at least 3 feet above the ground). Most of these things I didn't notice at all, but a few things I did notice were things like hearing footsteps in the hall from her room at night when Scott was asleep in our room. We both knew he was asleep and the cats couldn't have been stomping around like that. Another variation on this was hearing a door open, then footsteps and then hear the door open and close again. I would check and find Scott sound asleep. Once Scott is asleep nothing can wake him up.

I believe the kitchen was the biggest source of activity in the house as most of the odd things happened in there.

One time Dawn and I were in the kitchen about to make something for lunch. The only thing we needed was a lighter for the gas stove. Normally there is one by the stove for use but we couldn't find one when we searched every where in the kitchen. After we stopped looking, one just seemed to pop out of nowhere next to the fish tank on the counter. We both swore it wasn't there before.

Other things that happened were things like the faucet coming on by itself. This happened a few times after tightening it very firmly, and even when we were standing in the kitchen right next to it. Scott, Dawn and I saw like bluish mist come out of the kitchen towards us while we were eating. Dawn was constantly seeing things in there, mostly a tall shadowy figure and a few smaller ones. After a while she refused to sit where she could see the kitchen when it was night time.

This next incident prompted Dawn to want to smudge the house again. It was night and Scott was asleep and I was playing a video game and Dawn was in her room. I suddenly thought I smelled gas so I got up to go check the stove. On opening my door I noticed the bathroom door was shut and since it was really late, I didn't think anyone was inside and we usually keep the door open so that the cats have access to their boxes. I opened the door and Dawn was in there and I said ""Oh! Sorry, I thought the door had shut on it's own..."" She laughed and said ""oh"" and I said ""well I just got up cause I thought I smelled gas and I was going to check the stove"". So I said ""night"", checked the stove and went back to my room.

The next day, Dawn knocked on our bedroom door before she was going to work and asked if she could talk to me and I said sure. She came in and sat down on the bed and she looked a little freaked out. I asked her what the matter was and she told me why.

That night she had been having this odd feeling like she shouldn't leave her room or open the door. She told me how she felt like there was something outside of her door that she shouldn't come into contact with and she tried to stay in her room and abide by the feeling she had. She told me this became difficult because she felt the call of nature. Well finally she could not take it anymore and she got up and opened the door of her room and she said she saw me about to run by her door but I stopped for a moment to say with a manic grin on my face ""I smell gas!"" She said she thought that was sort of strange but she was more concerned with using the toilet at that moment. She said she saw me keep going down the hall into the living room where she heard me talking to the cats in a strange high pitched voice. She didn't think much more of this, she said, until I opened up the door a couple minutes later saying ""sorry"", and that I had smelled gas and was going to check on it.

After she told me all of this, she asked me how many times I had gotten up. I told her I had only gotten up that one time to check on the gas and I had never talked to the cats on the way. I also told her it was odd that I hadn't heard her door open or the bathroom door close or anything at all while that all happened. The walls are very thin and you can hear everything that goes on from one end to the other. She also told me that the other ""me"" had been wearing something different and hadn't made any sound when walking.

The last thing that happened right before Dawn got very sick and had to leave was something pushing her back into her chair forcefully in front of me. What I saw was a very small orange orb fly from my left around my front and fly very close to Dawn's mid-section and she was shoved into her chair. She said she didn't see the orb but she felt something push her into the chair she was sitting in.

She left soon after because she was very ill and we really don't know why she was so sick. After she left nothing really happened anymore. The only thing I remember is just an incident where all the cats were suddenly scared by something that was apparently in the hall or living room because they kept staring into the dark from the lighted area where the bathroom is and were hissing and pacing back and forth.

That's pretty much everything that I've experienced thus far, and there are probably more things that go on that I don't notice. I figure I am just really oblivious.

One other thing that I would like to add. I want to say that I do not want things to happen just for the excitement. What made me finally realize this were a couple of dreams that happened very recently (like in the last 30 days). I had 2 dreams of being attacked or threatened by something I could see. In one, something was tearing the walls off the room I was in and another one, I was being attacked and I wanted to hide but I knew there was nowhere in the house I could hide because it was all around me. When I woke up from these my first thoughts were ""How could I have ever wanted to experience things like that?"" and ""I think I would avoid wishing for things that would be more than I bargained for"". I realize now that it is probably a blessing that I haven't experienced those things I once wished for. I can only assume that was the message from my dreams.

My True Life Story as a Sensitive,"Florida, United States",Psychic / Medium,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Psychic / Medium :: My True Life Story as a Sensitive

L et me first start this off by saying this is all going to be true. I have never told anyone everything which I'm about to reveal here. As unbelievable it is going to sound, trust me its happened to ME! I now live in Florida but this all started when I was about 14, 10 years ago. I'd be laying in bed and I would hear what sounded like the carpet being muffed as feet were walking down the hallway. From where the sounds were coming from, I could instantly know where this ""thing"" was in the hallway and when it would stop at my doorway and come in my room. From where I placed the sounds, I would hear the floor crack so I knew it was a spirit but... Just disregarded it.

I could ""feel"" when something was around... I know it instantly wherever I go. That is if I'm paying attention. But here's a piece of information. It's very very slim that when I concentrate and listen and ""feel"" that I don't sense something. With that said, I know something is in here literally watching me type this right now. I have had years to tune this. I'm sweating and just a minute ago I heard something outside my door. I have started sweating bad... It's not a reaction or anything... It's actually got really hot in here in the past minute or 2. Seriously, It's getting to the point where I can't deal with it anymore.

I'll tell you what made me get up and write this. I was laying in bed. I fell asleep earlier around 9 because I just ate some food and got groggy and just went to sleep. When I close my eyes in the dark, I see colors swirling, shapes of people but they are, don't know how to say it, misshapen I guess. I sometimes also see my surroundings as if my eyes were open but it's more like a gray haze or a faint blackness added to everything. I'm not going to go to deep into that because I still need to test that out, the seeing when eyes closed part. But back to the reason I got on here. I have been trying to get to sleep for the past 2 and a half hours and whatever the hell is in my room, attachment imp fairy WHATEVER, isn't letting me go to sleep. It's touching me, literally. I feel it. Everything always touches me. It's starting to really piss me off. Ok, if you have been reading since I started thank you. You will notice that my whole attitude was the same in the beginning. And then RIGHT THERE it went to really pissed off. I actually caught myself grinding my teeth and a feeling of rage filled me. In no other words to describe it, I fought it off. My uncle had schizophrenia, that much is fact. But I know this is not that. I'm not trying to prove to any of you that this happens. Just the fact you are here reading this is enough. As I said I have never told anyone. I haven't even started by the way.

I lived in NY for a good 18 years of my life in one house. Big house, that's where that hallway and walking into my room stuff went on. I never actually SAW anything in that house but I always knew when something was around. I remember having a girl over one night though I don't remember her name and we were sleeping... Yes same bed. I didn't hear about this until about 6 months later when she told me out of the blue. I always tell people that I am in touch or I see things or something along those lines. I have told my mother everything pretty much. She's very spiritual and well, doesn't really give any advice just, agrees that's its happening. Don't know why. But that girl said one night while in my room, I was dead asleep by the way, she woke up thinking I was touching her or something on her left side which is by the way the only way to get on the bed and she told me she looked and there was an indentation on the bed, the size of a butt. As if someone was sitting down. She said she was scared out of her mind and just grabbed me and held tight and apparently passed out because of fear.

I have done that myself by the way. Just, black out because of just pure and utter fear. That was in that house. Nothing ever hurt me there but that was going to change. That went on for a long time. It was there that I got used to it always happening. I know NOW that, that was the WORST THING to EVER do. Get used to it. It's like, I accepted it and now I can't get rid of ANYTHING! The thing is like a magnet, because now I KNOW more are around. They are attracted to me and I don't know why. Well, I do. It's because I'm sensitive and in turn I'm sensitive to them and they KNOW I KNOW they are here. Don't let anyone ever tell you these things don't have a conscience, because I can vouch... They absolutely do.

Ok. Enough of that house that was pretty much the beginning. I ended up moving there with my mother. My dad died before I was 1 year old so put that in context if it holds any relevance, which I know it does, I just do not need to say it. But yeah, I moved with my mother to the back of a house with 1 of her friends into 3 rooms. It was where she was going to live for a bit because she just wanted to relax and I was going off to the navy in a month. Pretty much just a hangout spot, I ust sat by the pool drinking beer, just relaxing, cooking food and all that, you know the drill. Well, I will never forget this in my life. I do not really remember what happened before this or after this, because I left to join the navy and it was a while ago. I bought this huge couch. I used to sleep on it. I'm laying there trying to go to sleep, lights are off.

I feel a slight pricking at my big toe. Right on the end. It starts to hurt a little and it starts to progress. Was not that long, I can't recall a specific time frame but then it went right through my body. Like a bolt of lightning and it hit my eyes. I swear to god I started seeing one of those hypnotic swirly black and white things that rotate. I hope you know what I'm talking about. But instead of black and white it was bright red and yellow swirls. One for each eye.

I remember trying to scream and I could not. It was like my body wouldn't react. Once again I can't give a time frame but it wasn't like 10 minutes or anything, more like 30 seconds or something. I was fighting to try and open my eyes and I couldn't. I couldn't do a damned thing but I KNEW instantly what was happening. I still think to this very day that, if I didn't fight this off, I would have killed my mother and probably everyone in that house if I let whatever it was get a hold of me. The only thing I say in regards to that is I almost got possessed when I am speaking to someone about it. I fought it off. I can't remember exactly what happened after that, but I know I opened my eyes, turned on the light and waited. Yea I did scream I went aaaahhhhhhhhhhhhh when I fought it off. I can vividly remember what I saw on my eyes when they were shut. I'll never forget. I then went and slept in my mother's room. Yea, say what you want... 18 and sleeping in mother's room. Anyone else probably wouldn't have been able to fight this shiat off but I did. Ok, I'm getting defensive and that's not good. Here's another bit of info.

I can't remember if it was the same night or not. I was laying there in my mother's room and she was sleeping. I was doing my ""staring at one spot but also using my peripheral vision to look around the room"" thing and well, I started seeing what looked like flickers of light showing up all around the room's ceiling. But not on it. Floating around. There was faint light coming in from a window but was only 1 window and just 1 beam of moonlight coming in from the tiny window. It was maybe 12x6 window. You know those small types. That was enough to light up the room faintly. I could see everything because my eyes were well adjusted to the night. Those what appeared to be diamonds by glittering were all about an inch apart.

I started seeing the really faint outlines of what I knew to be wings but these things I saw were not small... Bigger than birds a lot bigger. I saw wingspan, that when fully opened, was about a foot and a half. These were everywhere. They were careful when moving around not to go directly into that beam of light. I'm very comfortable when I'm not alone looking at all this stuff. After looking around the room at all, something happened and even just thinking about it right now, at 6:23am, I get the shivers. Here's what happened:

Before, I could clearly see the whole room. Instantly, the whole door went PITCH BLACK! Like, something came through the door from the hallway or maybe a portal opened up from inside the room in FRONT of the door. I don't know nor do I want to. That's too much, even for me, not to understand but to think about before I get some help. Something came in the room. I'll describe it in a few seconds. I remember it walking around to both sides of the bed. ALWAYS LOOKING AT ME! It was concentrated on me. I would always feel stuff climbing on the bed. Starting from the end and working its way up to me. This thing got on the bed. I knew exactly where it was, because I was looking at it. I can't remember exact timeframes and all that because well, I'm not a computer but I looked to my left and saw this thing. It had what looked like a human body and a snake or a crocodile head attacking my mother. I saw it doing this not 2 feet away from me. It seriously was going apeshiat on her. She didn't feel a thing.

I'm thinking about it right now and I remember seeing it biting through her face but can't remember what its other parts were doing but believe me, that was enough. It was snapping is a better word. Well. I guess it was my turn because I looked straight and there in the middle of the bed is about a 6 feet thing. It was huge. Muscular but all bent up. Not a regular human body but all weirded out, bent. It did the thing that bruce lee did when taunting people... That finger thing thing, hope you know what you mean but not exactly that. It was calling to me to follow it or go somewhere with it. It was using all its fingers on one hand but not all at once. Open your hand for me and then close is starting with your pinky first and do it slow. That's what it was doing. It was doing it right in front of my face and then a little further away. I can't say what its face looked like with any certainty but I am 100% positive it happened. Reason is I can't remember. I don't know if it all just stopped or they disappeared or anything because I can't remember. I just have vivid shots in my mind of the thing snapping at my mom. The blackness in front/on the door and that thing above me. I still had those touching me feelings and all that since then before I left for the navy.

Boot camp was fine, overseas was fine. Even on the ship. Fine except every now and then I'd feel a presence but you can only guess what that was. Ships and navy ground were routinely blessed so I guess that's why I wasn't bothered. I know the ships were haunted without a doubt. Probably just old sailors or something.

I'm going to go to just the finer points on this area because it's not one of my proudest moments.

I met a girl in san diego. Got into Crystal Meth, knew it was bad then, know it now. I don't do it anymore, was a while ago. Well, I would do that stuff out there and never really saw anything. Granted that stuff keeps you up at night and this is when they like to come out. Not being seen is good so then people can dismiss it.

I left california with her and came to florida, where my mom currently lives and I live with again. That girl is long gone now but here's the story of an experience. Did a lot of that stuff one night and it's night time and it's just me and her. Using that stuff I somehow discovered I could look into a TV's reflection because it was black/brown and see what was in the room. I'm still able to do it but I don't do it anymore because it scares the crap out of me. Going back to that night I had no fear. She was sleeping and there I am, just sitting there staring at a tv that isn't on. Yes, drug problem, I know. I'm done so it's not an issue. I quit drinking, quit smoking.

I'm starting to see what look like giant rats but they are rapidly changing colors and coming in and out of existence. But they aren't moving regularly... They are shifting. Appearing one place then appearing somewhere else really close, but didn't walk it. Well, I just sit there looking. Purely in an observer mode but then these things start coming near me and I can make out there heads like. Trying to eat me and I could feel it. It couldn't have been imagination making it real, who knows, but read on.

I woke up this girl and just told her all of this. She told me to shut up or something and well, for a while I just let them do whatever they were doing. Something came through the door. It was a human figure but I couldn't make out arms. All I saw was the outline on head and body. It was a shimmer... Like off a hot road in the summer, the heat. Same exact thing, I could tell it was turned right at me. It never tried to touch me or anything it just walked around. It sometimes stood right next to me but I don't remember it ever touching me.

Here's another thing. I would see things walking around on the ground... I want to call them trolls. They were about a foot tall. I could see them moving around on the ground but they barely made it above my view of the bed. I'm just calling the trolls by the way. Well I hear noises outside of something climbing on the gutters that were down and laying on the ground right outside the bedroom window... RIGHT outside it, they were about a 3 foot tall pile of metal and I heard stuff walking on it. I get up and go AAAHHHHHAHAH because I'm so high I think I would scare whatever it was away. Not the case. I looked out the window and everywhere. In my yard. I saw eyes. The same little eyes I saw in my room walking around. They were outside literally everywhere. They were moving around and what seemed to me to be talking among themselves. About what I have no idea.

I go back and sit down and look at the tv again and out of nowhere, I see a streak of light come through my ceiling and hit this girl laying next to me. Then a whole BUNCH of bright blue snaps like firecrackers start going off on her and about her. Like, little bursts of bright blue light. This goes on for about 15 to 30 seconds, can't really remember. Later that day, I saw more of the shimmer images. I have never seen them since nor those little troll things. You can probably disregard the last instance because of the drugs and if the moderator deems it necessary to remove those instances from this post, then so be it, I won't complain.

It does provide someone with the ability to say that the drugs were the cause but personally I believe that the drug actually activated that part of my mind and I was able to perceive that which I would not normally see even with my high perception. There are instances in which seers and the like have used drugs to do that. I can't reference anything but common knowledge. Guess what I am trying to say is ""yea you can say the drugs did it"" or something but hey, I experienced it, I believe it's real. You can also say that it seemed real to me. Oh well, I can live with that. Everything else really happened with no help of any kind. Clear mind clear though clear conscious.

Keep in mind I have never went into this great of detail with ANYONE and I have clearly spent an hour probably more typing this. Ever since I was 14-20, then 22-24 I have dealt with all types of supernatural experiences. I'm generally just tired of it all and just, well, I seriously need a break.

Oh yea, about a different girl way way back, laying in my bed sleeping. Her back was to me. This was in the NY house. I looked at the back of her head, this was at night and then closed my eyes. I remember seeing the outline of her and then the outline turned over and looked right at me. Right in the eyes. MY EYES WERE CLOSED. I can't remember if it went away after a second or to but it smiled at me and I either opened my eyes showing myself she was still turned away or it went away itself. Cant remember. But I think I saw her soul. Seriously, I think that's what it was.

Ok I have spent all this time writing this, please forgive the typos because I'm sure there are some. Also the grammar, it's the way I type. I really appreciate anyone who took the time to read all that. Anyone feel free to comment but only courteous or the like. No need for bashing or anything. I get that enough at the nighttime hours, I don't need your help :P

The fact I joke about it isn't good, hope you realize that. I'm just used to it.

The Ghost That Does Not Let Me Sleep,"Idaho, United States",Psychic / Medium,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Psychic / Medium :: The Ghost That Does Not Let Me Sleep

H ello, My name is Tyrell and am 17. I have seen ghosts al my life and it seems like they are beginning to not scare me anymore. Well, all but one. Over the past few days, I have not been able to get to sleep. And this wasn't just normal insomnia, this was someone who did not want me to sleep. Every time I fell asleep, I jumped awake as if I had just had a nightmare. The only thing is I had just closed my eyes.

But the other night, I was sleeping on my couch and I jumped awake only to see a figure sitting on the back of the couch. I squealed in fear and pulled the covers over my head. When I pulled them down, it was gone. A similar thing happened to me in my room the day before yesterday. I jumped awake and saw a person walk right through my bed right in front of me.

I had a friend recently die in a car accident. His name was braden. That figure I saw in my room could have been him. Although I don't know what he would want to visit me for.

He is not the only ghost that resides in my home. All my life I have seen people I never knew and even animals! Sometimes one of my pets that had passed on. So I am not sure if this was braden but all I know is I want to find out.

Haunted Nights,Suriname,Poltergeists / Physical Manifestations,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Poltergeists / Physical Manifestations :: Haunted Nights

W hen my mother moved to another country, I then had to go live with my aunt. I slept in a 'storage room'. My bed was between a washing machine (at my head side) and a large old wooden clothes cabinet. At night when everyone was asleep, the house was completely dark. Not a single light was left on. My 'bedroom' was illuminated by a street light across the street and that suited me just fine. One night I woke up. I didn't know what time it was, but it must have been after 12:00 am. The house was completely dark and so was my room! The street light was out.

I was awakened by a sound coming from behind me (I laid on my back, facing the clothing cabinet). It was a crackling sound, like when you squeeze a plastic bag. I figured maybe a mouse or so was on the washing machine, walking over a plastic bag, so I turned on my belly to face the washing machine. As soon as I turned, the sound stopped. I stretched out my hand to feel on top of the washing machine, but there was nothing on it. I turned to get back to sleep and the sound started again. I turned on my belly: it stopped at once. This went one for a while, I was scared, but I eventually fell asleep.

The next night I woke up again. The street light was still out, the room was pitch black. The same sound woke me up, with the same 'turning/stopping' routine. At one point I refused to turn anymore, so I kept on my back hearing the sound behind me. I was too scared to get up and leave the room or call anybody: my aunt and I weren't the best of friends. When I kept ignoring the sound, it got louder and louder, filling up the whole room. Then it abruptly stopped. It was silent for a few minutes but then the unthinkable happened: the doors of the clothes cabinet started to squeak! It was an old rusty door which made a squeaking sound when opening it up. The door wasn't actually opening, you just heard the sound. And I didn't need to turn to see where the sound came from, I was facing it! I started trembling, I lay really still, my eyes shut tight. I fell asleep eventually. The next night the street lights were on again, my room was well lit. The noises did not occur again.

I never told my aunt about it, but I always wondered what happened those two nights.

Fighting Back Spiritual Pests in the Night,"Colorado, United States",Old Hags / Night Attacks / Sleep Paralysis,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Old Hags / Night Attacks / Sleep Paralysis :: Fighting Back Spiritual Pests in the Night

I 've had several occurrences of entities trying to attack me in my sleep. I was attacked by a particularly nasty one a few years ago. I could feel it pressing down on me and I tried to struggle out of it. That's when it grabbed me by the arms and shook me once really hard, totally paralyzing me. Then I could feel a face emerge close to mine and it spoke something in my ear in a language I'd never heard. I just waited for it to finish while seething at the fact that I couldn't move. Eventually, it let me go and vanished.

When I woke up, I could still feel its hand prints on my arms and it was cold, as if the heat was sucked out of my skin where it touched me. Creepy, but I know how important it is not to be afraid of these things. I've read about them and know they can't actually hurt you. After they realize I'm not afraid of them, they usually give up and move on. This was the first one that actually seemed to get angry with me for not being scared. It was certainly the most powerful of all the entities I've encountered.

The last spirit attack happened about a month ago. I was getting woken up at exactly 4am every day and couldn't figure out why but I guessed it might be another dark entity messing with me again. I decided to start playing spiritual music when I went to bed and that night, as I dozed off, the music became distorted and chaotic. I realized something was in the room with me and when I did, it immediately tried to wrap itself around my spine. I was able to wake up and shoo it off before it paralyzed me. That was the last time it came around.

These things make me angry. I have a day job and these spiritual pests interfere with my sleep. I have some human enemies who are into black magic and keep trying to re-establish rapport with me after their curses fail. The story behind their vendetta against me is ridiculous but it's typical of foolish and arrogant dabblers in petty evil. I just wonder if the ghost attacks are somehow connected.

Does anyone know if humans can actually summon evil spirits and send them after their enemies with ritual magic or something? I want to know more. I would like to be able to counterattack these things and maybe even send them back to where they came from, especially if they were conjured by humans.

Breeze Through the Window,Malaysia,Apparitions / Voices / Touches,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Apparitions / Voices / Touches :: Breeze Through the Window

Y ears and years back, my family and I went up to Genting highland for few days vacation - our Indonesian maid had told us many times that she has the tendency to encounter spiritual experience, and she had many times growing up!

Genting highland is the one and only casino in Malaysia - a lot of peoples committed suicide because of compulsive gambling and huge huge debts they got themselves into. If you have a chance to go up there you will notice you can't open the windows in every hotel more than 5 inches.

We rented an apartment suite in this old hotel which is built with floor-to-ceiling windows. We were cold thus we shut all the windows and watched tv in the living room. My sister was sitting with her back against the window next to the curtain - and suddenly the curtain moved a little bit as though there was this breeze blew through it.

My sister looked and commented: ""all the windows are closed, how could those breeze get through them?""

After the few days vacation when we returned home - our maid told us what she saw on the other side, she saw an white floating object outside the window and it stuck its hand through the glass and flip those curtain. She didn't want to tell us there and then because it would have scared us.

I don't know how much do you believe in this but I know she would not tell a lie.

Driveway Ghost,"Florida, United States",Apparitions / Voices / Touches,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Apparitions / Voices / Touches :: Driveway Ghost

A pril 3, 2007 I built an extension on to the side of my driveway. I run surveillance cameras on my property night and day. On April 15th, I started to wind my tape back and was startled when the clearest vision appeared on the film. The appearance of a ghost walking into the drive way (hood, long white robe), it then seems to take the form of a lightening bolt trying to get into a car sitting there. It also tries to get into a light on the end of the driveway. It then takes form again standing over the driveway in a long white robe with flowing sleeves as if blessing my new drive way (activity seen on both sides of the driveway). It then flies back out into the street, comes in like a streak of light beside the car, takes form on the grass at the end of the driveway with a glow, and what appears to be a face with black hair. This is all on tape as proof of what I saw. Have not had the time to have this properly analyzed yet.

This was the first happening in several years. After my husband died in 1981, I had several occurrences (his picture falling off the wall.) A fork lying on the bar flying up off the bar and slams back down on it's own. The black form of a man at the foot of my bed etc.

I had a black friend in the neighborhood (the only black), who was poorly treated, she was eighty three years old. She died January 9, 2006, with a stroke which I attribute to neighbors burning fires to harass us. They burned fires four to five feet high starting November, 2006 up until she died. They told us they were going to burn night and day just to harass us (and they did).

I was discussing my videocassette ghost with her sister, she said ""sister always called you her guardian angel, and has come back as your guardian angel to help you with this bad neighborhood..."" And I always say all things are possible.

Cat Friends,Malawi,Pets / Animals,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Pets / Animals :: Cat Friends

I t was a sunny, clear, Saturday in June. The temperature was 72, and still rising. My mom was at work, so I was left home with my dad and the animals. ""When you're done with those dishes, why don't you take the critters out in the backyard to play? They could use the exercise; especially that freaky cat of yours..."", Dad said. ""Ok..."", I replied, washing a fork. Then, he left to go make some deliveries.

About ten minutes later, I had finished the dishes and was picking at my now, ruined nail polish. I went and opened the door so the cat and dog could go out. The dog burst out of the house, while the cat walked cautiously out, hoping that the dog wouldn't chase her back in. Unfortunately, that's what happened. So I got up and carried the cat out. She squirmed in my arms, trying to run over to where the graves for our other animals were. I leaned down and placed her by them. Her eyes started to follow something, and she zoomed after it, going behind me. ""She probably saw a toad..."", I thought to my self.

Letting the cat roam about, I knelt down, and prayed. Suddenly, I heard meows come from behind me, but they couldn't have all been from one cat because they all sounded at the same time. I immediately thought of strays. That scared me because I didn't want a cat fight going on, and I especially didn't want my cat getting hurt. I heard them again, but this time I could hear them more clearly. They all sounded different from each other, and they were so familiar to me. I spun around and saw a breathtaking sight; my two cats that had passed away were playing together with my current cat. They were rolling, and tumbling along on the bright, green, grass, under the sun. It was so peaceful. My eyes watered, and when I blinked, they were gone. My cat got up and sat on my lap purring.

Ever since that day, I've seen them playing out of the corner of my eye. It always reminds me that I'm not alone.

Things that Go Bump in the Night,"Nevada, United States",Misc,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Misc :: Things that Go Bump in the Night

W e're deciding to put all of our little stories that couldn't quite make it on their own... All in one:

I say this only because it LOOKS like my cat Mystique. The weird thing is, it ALWAYS looks like Mystique, it never looks like my other cat Madden. But sometimes it acts like him. The first time we noticed it was with us was when I was in the bathroom. I saw Mystique's paw under the door, and I just figured she wanted to be fed, so I washed my hands and went to my room. She was sitting on her favorite spot on this metal shelf thing with a princess blankie. I asked my brother if she had been there the whole time and he said yes. Then I remembered the paw under the door didn't have orange toes, all of Mystiques toes are orange.

The second time that we can remember is the other night I saw Mystique run out of my room and I asked Darian to go get her, he looked over and said ""she's right there"" and I just laughed a little nervously and said ""It's back"".

We feel it jump on the bed all the time, and it just feels like a cat jumping up on the bed and laying by us, or just jumping off.

And last night we thought one of my cats jumped up on my computer desk and Dare asked ""Are your cats supposed to go on your desk?"" and I was like ""why?"" and he said ""Because there is a cat on your desk"" But Mystique was next to him, and Madden was chewing on my hair.

And once we were laying in my bed, reading ghost stories actually. And I felt Madden chewing on my hair, and I asked Darian to move him because it was bothering me, and he said that Madden was in his shirt. And Mystique was under the laptop because she's fat and was laying on me. Lol.

And sometimes I hear scratching on my door, and I think it's Mystique but, I open it and there is nothing there, and she doesn't run that fast, trust me...

We see it jump off of stuff and run out of rooms, but, it never makes me feel uneasy or scared, it's sort of my buddy, and I feel like it's there to watch us. I think it may be my cat that died that we were all very close to, AnnaBelle, but I don't know.

My brother Darian was watching a movie and he looked over because he's paranoid and he saw a tall dark figure walking into the second living room, and he moved his leg because it was blocking the view to see what it was, to see what was there and he looked over to see if it was our dad, but no, he was watching the movie too...

When you're in Darian's room, you always feel like your being watched and his little chain to turn on the light just snapped. We think it's due to a girl named Amber that talked to us through the Ouija board. She doesn't like me, but I guess she has a crush on him. I try not to go in his room either, My left arm or leg usually gets really cold and like. It feels electric. And he feels things touch him at night.

Max was another spirit that contacted us via Ouija board. He used to talk to me, I don't know why he liked me so much, but in my room, at our old house I always felt watched, that's why I never changed in there. But one day during one of our sessions with the Ouija board we were talking to him, he told us he was 15. We don't know why he was at the house, we never bothered to ask. But one time my brother said that he thought this was stupid and went to get up. A book was hurdled at him from the other side of the room.

It was my fairy book, it's a pretty large book and it was on top of my stereo at the time. There was no way it could have made it that far across the room by natural causes. We asked Max if he did it, he said he had. We went to put it back up, and I had these little tea cups and they had a pot to go with them and the pot was upside down on one of the speakers and the rest were untouched, and a unicorn statue I had that sat in front of the book was left untouched. So today we joke about darian getting the book thrown at him, he doesn't think it's funny. But I do.

One time when I lived in Rathdrum Idaho, me and a bunch of friends walked down to this church, we were eating those little cracker sticks with the cheese in the thing and were just messing around, Buba decided to open this window to this shed thing and a thumb, just a thumb, came out and told us to get out of there as quick as we could. We ran out of there. I was so scared for a long time, but now I wonder if I just imagined it. But, if so, how could all my friends have seen it too?

And just so you all know, I no longer play with the Ouija board, but Darian is always asking me to, and I never owned one, one of my friends had one. And then we used to make them, but they scare me too much to use them now... Any questions, feel free to ask, we're always on here.

Reassurance from Mum,Ireland,Family / Friends Visits,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Family / Friends Visits :: Reassurance from Mum

I never really knew my mother. She died when I was eleven. Having four older teenage sisters, my mother was more concerned with them and their teenage issues than my three brothers and I, so I never really got to spend much time with her. As a result we don't have many memories of her.

She was diagnosed with Cancer in May of 1990, and after only four months fighting it, she died in August of the same year. She spent the entirety of her illness in hospital. While she was ill, my brothers and I spent a lot of time with friends and relatives - my father wanted to keep us away from the hospital and protect us from the fact that our mother was dying. She died on a Wednesday and the last time we saw her was the previous Thursday. We never got to say goodbye.

It's tradition in Ireland that when someone dies, before they're buried they must spend one night in their home surrounded by friends and family, and one night alone in the church. We brought my mother's body home and laid her out in her bedroom. All our friends and family filtered in and out of the house, saying their goodbyes. My brothers and I felt a bit distanced from the whole thing.

That evening the house was still full of people. Suddenly my youngest brother, who was eight at the time, came running into the house asking us to come outside with him, that he had something to show us. My two other brothers, one of my sisters and I followed him outside. He pointed to the embankment that ran alongside our house. We looked and saw the perfect white silhouette of a person. The strange thing was that it was just my brothers and I who could see it! My older sister could see nothing & thought we were making the whole thing up! We stayed for a few minutes looking at it - it didn't move, disappear or change. We felt no fear from it - just reassurance. We eventually went back inside, but the figure stayed by the house all night, only visible to my brothers and I. We've never seen it since.

I believe it was the spirit of my mother, coming to watch over us one last time, coming to say goodbye to us.

Message from Mum,Ireland,Family / Friends Visits,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Family / Friends Visits :: Message from Mum

T here were ten of us in our family - five girls, three boys and my parents. Four girls came first, followed by one boy, then myself, with my two younger brothers following after. William, the second youngest, was born in 1980, three months premature. My mother had a fall, which brought on premature labor.

William spent the next four months in intensive care, battling for his young life. My parents went through hell, trying to spend as much time as possible with their newborn son, as well as caring for the six other children they had. When William pulled through, the doctors said my parents shouldn't try for any more children. They said my mother would never be able to carry another child to term and it was best that she be sterilized. My parents reluctantly agreed and the procedure was booked.

When my mother went in for the procedure, she had to have a pregnancy test done just in case - it came back positive! Abortion was not an option in Ireland back then, so my mother had to proceed with the pregnancy. She went private - my father worked all the overtime he could to pay for the best medical treatment he could. My mother was classed a high risk pregnancy, due to the premature birth of her last child, as well as her age - she was 36 which was then considered old to be having a baby. It was a difficult pregnancy for her - there was that huge risk that she would miscarry. My parents were absolutely thrilled when my youngest brother was born healthy.

As a result, my mother was always a bit overprotective of my youngest brother. She saw him as the child she almost never had. She adored him! He was eight when my mother died in 1990. I don't think he fully understood what was going on. As he got older he'd cry every time we spoke of her. He missed her so much.

I started having dreams about my mother when I was about fifteen. It was always the same dream. She'd be sitting at our kitchen table with my youngest brother. There was a huge pile of sweets in front of them, and she was helping him to count out sweets for himself. Nobody else was allowed to have any sweets. She wouldn't speak to anyone else either, just whispered to my brother. This dream continued for a couple of years, until I was 17 and it changed completely.

I dreamt that my mother was standing in our kitchen. She was dressed up in the outfit she'd worn to her brother's wedding a number of years before she died - a green dress with a large white hat and white handbag. I kept asking her why she was there, but she didn't answer, just kept smiling. She stayed for a few minutes, before telling me that she was waiting for someone and that she would be leaving soon. The dream then ended.

The following afternoon my youngest brother died. He was aged fifteen and it was the day before the seventh anniversary of my mother's death. I believe my mother had been trying to warn me all along that she was going to take her baby boy back.

I lived in a town house and I was six at the time. When me and my family were sitting on the living room couch, watching TV, all of a sudden they heard a loud crash that sounded like glass breaking. They ran downstairs to find the remains a light bulb in swept into a dust pan with a broom standing next to it. Not only did this occurrence happened, I was also pushed one time on my back, my cats were circling around me looking up. The smell of smoke could be smelled and no one smoked in the home or next door either side. There were footsteps around my mom and dad's bed at night and my mom got screamed ""boo!"" through her ear while washing clothes.

I regret my childhood because of that home, I recently started my own paranormal investigation team to help others.

Ouija Boards,"Texas, United States",Ouija Board / Seances,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Ouija Board / Seances :: Ouija Boards

T his happened quite some time ago, I'm telling it until now because I really think it's going to make a really boring story but I have about a million questions to ask about Ouija boards, so maybe some people out there have some ideas and not answers but, suggestions about what they think.

Some while ago, I was curious about the nature of ouija boards, so I decided since my mom told me no about buying me one, my sister and I made one on our own. Before I continue, my sister's friend has a ouija board and she told us supposedly that the devil works through ouija boards, and that through it, it tries to possess you and unbelievable baloney like that. I made one, and I tried it using one of those key rings.

Some supposed spirit named Tiffany started to talk to us through it, and for a time, I believed that it was just me, but as I progressed in using it, Tiffany (or whatever) began telling us things. Like her age, and the way she died and she actually told me a story about herself, about her family and if there was other spirits in the room, like one time she said that my great-grandmother was in the kitchen.

Then, other ""spirits"" began talking to us through it, our supposed guardian angels and one time, even Jesus himself. I began to believe that we were really talking to God's spirits because things began being spelled on the ouija board that we would have NEVER have any intention of spelling ourselves, just to amuse or entertain. I don't know if to doubt that it was real or that if spirits were really talking to us. I started getting addicted to using it and then began getting skeptical about everything because the ""spirits"" began telling us stuff that was NOT true. The weird part was that I would feel their presences and that they were really using a bit of my energy combined with theirs to talk to us.

So, I know that your probably bored by now, but I have many questions to ask, and if you could help me out, I would be grateful. First, do you think that ouija boards are serious about the dead and are not just out there to entertain you? Why can't the spirits prove to us that they're there and not just a figment of our anticipating imaginations? Are home-made Ouijas proper to use, or can you use them? I have much more questions but I don't want to bore you to death so, I'll be going now

Thanks for reading my story to the end, and if you have any comments, please don't hesitate to leave them. Thanks to everyone!

Angry Ouija Board Ghost,"New York, United States",Ouija Board / Seances,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Ouija Board / Seances :: Angry Ouija Board Ghost

I just tried the ouija board for the first time last night, even though I know they are BAD. My friend told me that they were a good experience, though, so I used it at midnight. It started to work extremely quickly.

First, a little background. My friend's house is an old funeral home, and the spot we were using it on was where the dead bodies were displayed. It turns out the owner died of a heart attack in that room so we felt it would be good to use it there. Before I go any further, no insults telling me I'm dumb or crazy for using this. Not to sound stuck up, but if me and my friend want a scare we do what it takes. Little daredevils...

First I asked if there was a ghost with us. It moved to ""yes"". I then asked if it was male or female and how old. It was a 72 year old woman who died of a heart attack, just like my bud's mother said. I asked her if she was good or bad and I was not happy. It said BAD. This is typical, using this portal to evil, but we continued. I asked if it wanted to hurt Cody (my friend) and it spelled out HATE. At first I was confused, so I asked it again if it had intentions of hurting him. It said YES.

My friend decided to take a break so we went into the kitchen for a few chicken wings. It was FREEZING in there and then, Cody fell. I thought he was being a clutz, but he said he got a sharp pain in his ankle and then I still didn't believe. He looked petrified and his eyes seemed like they were following something. He said he saw a shadow in the other room. I believed him because of the sheer terror on his face. We decided to get more answers.

I asked the ghost why she was doing this and it spelled out HATE again. I then asked if there were more than one ghosts in the house because when I asked it if it wanted to hurt Cody, it went back and forth from yes to no. It said yes, but it also moved towards GOODBYE. We let go to keep the ghost with us and asked it one more question: How do you want to hurt Cody? It spelled out BADLY then quickly went to GOODBYE. We knew we were in for it.

I told my friend this was serious but he ""was having fun at the same time as being scared out of his head..."" I had fun with my first ouija board experience, but I didn't like talking to that thing.

Nightly Visitors,Suriname,Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: Nightly Visitors

T hese 2 events occurred when I was babysitting my brothers' kids at his house. There is a balcony in the front of the house, my room (the guest room) was across of it; it looked out on the balcony. I stayed up late studying. It was near 11:00 pm. The kids were already asleep. I hadn't closed up the house yet; the doors and windows were shut, but the curtains were still open. Also the windows of the room I was in were still opened. I wasn't scared of thieves because my brother had a big dog.

All of a sudden the dog started barking fiercely on the balcony. I got up and walked over to the front door to see if there was someone there. I looked through the glass panel of the door and saw the dog barking into a corner of the balcony, as if it had corned something there. I thought maybe a rat. I went back to my room, but the dog kept on barking. Not wanting him to wake up the kids I decided to step out and make him stop. As soon as I unlocked the door, everything happened so fast: the dog gave out a loud wail as if someone/something had hit it, I got goosebumps all over when I realized there was nothing on the balcony and I felt some kind of wind brush pass my legs, into the living room. I was extremely scared, but I investigated the house, thinking that maybe some kind of small animal came in. I found nothing.

I didn't tell my brother, because he would have been angry with me for stepping out of the house. The next day an elderly woman explained to me that the dog probably cornered some kind of 'spirit' who wanted to use my brother's yard as a shortcut. It could be, because my brother's house is near a cemetery. She said the 'thing' probably fled into the house and escaped through the windows of the guest bedroom.

Another night, again I was babysitting at my brother's house. After watching some TV, I went to bed. This time I slept beside my little niece. I could not fall asleep, so I laid staring in the dark. It must have been past midnight. All of a sudden I heard slow, dragging footsteps. I was wide awake and I knew the kids and I were the only ones home. If it was my brother I would have heard his car coming up the driveway. The footsteps continued to the bedroom door, then they stopped. I looked at the door in terror, wondering what would happen next. Then there were three loud knocks on the door. I laid there in the dark, scared out of my wits. I laid awake until I heard my brothers' car up the driveway. I was extremely relieved and decided there and then that I would never babysit for him again.

I now live in my own place. The previous tenant was strangled in that house. People always told me I was crazy to rent the house, but I needed a place to stay. I can't say I'm 'actively' being disturbed, but I often wake up at night, extremely cold, really chilling to my bones, as if I was sitting in a freezer. That lasts for a few seconds and then I feel normal again. I believe that when this happens, the spirit of the previous tenant is around.

A Little Girl in the Kitchen,"Oklahoma, United States",Apparitions / Voices / Touches,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Apparitions / Voices / Touches :: A Little Girl in the Kitchen

T his happened a couple months ago. My father and I were in the living room watching a movie, and it was around dusk so we had all the lights turned off. I kept getting this really weird feeling that something was watching me, and I couldn't stop looking into the kitchen, because I kept imagining seeing monsters out of shadows and other kitchenware. One of the times that I looked into the kitchen, I saw a little girl, about seven years of age, standing there and staring at me. I looked away, thinking that I was imagining things again, but when I looked back there was a blue haze where she had been standing.

The next day at school I told some of my classmates about my encounter, and they told me that they had seen her, too. One of them had seen her at the park, swinging, then was gone but left the swing swaying slowly, a blue haze where she had been.

Another asked me what she had looked like. I said that she was a little girl of about seven years, and that she had blonde hair and looked like she was from 1900-1930. My classmate said that she thought her name was Sally.

I told a friend of mine about ""Sally"" and she said I was seeing things. The following day, she told me that it was around eleven and her parents were asleep, and that she was in the living room on the computer. She got a really strange feeling, and looked into the kitchen, which is separated from the living room by a low ledge. She told me that there was a little girl standing there, with blonde hair and a 1920's nightgown on.

Another time, a friend of mine and I were in my room, and the lights started flickering. Light and dim, light and dim. I didn't see the little girl, but I saw the remainings of a blue haze...

We're Being Watched,"Georgia, United States",Apparitions / Voices / Touches,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Apparitions / Voices / Touches :: We're Being Watched

I can still remember this, even though I was about nine years old when it happened. I was at my friend's house (we call her DJ. Still do) for a sleep over. I had to sleep on an air mattress because I was the only one who could stand it. My head was on the side nearest the door. I woke up later that night, only to find the outlines of three people. I knew they were ghosts because I had heard about that kind of thing. One looked like a woman, like she was holding a baby and watching some non-existent show on the turned off TV screen. The third was leaning over me, looking at me. I was so scared! Being only nine, I thought that hiding under the blanket would work, so I did, and eventually got back to sleep.

The next day, I was driving to McDonalds or something and I told my friend and her mom. Her mom said that she knew there were ghosts in the house. One time, while DJ's dad was at work and DJ was at school, one of DJ's stuffed animals was thrown across the hallway. Another time, her mom was downstairs playing pool and her grandparents said that they had heard her laughing upstairs... They got kind of ticked because they thought DJ's mom had tricked them. She also went on to tell other stories, but I can't remember them.

My First Real Seeing,"Texas, United States",Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: My First Real Seeing

I was three or four years old, and very much scared of the dark (what child who is young, isn't?). My grandma's house wasn't how usual grandma's houses are. She had the most haunted house in Arizona! In her house there was two living rooms. The first one you walked inhad the most energy. I hated that room! That room was full of unpleasant things. It was like living in a nightmare! When you walked out of the first living room, there was out bed room where we would sleep (when we moved out, it was turned into a big computer room). That's also a room I hated!

The second room is also where a lot of activity is. When we slept in the ""computer room"" we would hear things at night when the things would come out to scare. I was a little girl, and I knew hardly anything to understand what a simple ghost was. There were ghosts, orbs, poltergeists...

There were these children, twins in fact that would play with me and my sister on their tricycles. How the tricycles got there? I have no clue. But, these children were in danger! They were held against their will when they were ""alive"" and their father had raped them and mother had killed them. A dark evil force had kept them there to use them as a portal to our house. One day, I was coloring in my book, and the girl had picked up a red crayon and wrote ""HELP"" on a piece of paper. NO JOKE! And my sister kept having dreams that this was happening to these children. Why would any human hurt such innocent people?

In the first living room, you would hear scratching on the walls, foot steps, see things at the corner of your eyes, and look to see what it was and nothing would be there. Demons? Ghost? I don't know. I was young, and didn't know anything of these things. The reason why I know now is because I remember some, and my mother told me some.

I know some might not think I am telling the truth. But things like this did happen!

Family Cemetery,"Alabama, United States",Apparitions / Voices / Touches,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Apparitions / Voices / Touches :: Family Cemetery

M y father's family cemetery is located at the foot of two mountains in a hollow. The cemetery is divided into 4 family groups. One enclosed cemetery has a tombstone that vibrates when you touch it. My father told me this story and one day I had him take me to it. I put a bottle of water on top on the stone and nothing happened. I touched it and it began to vibrate. I put the bottle of water back on it and it didn't move. I leaned up against it with the bottle of water and it vibrated. When I stepped away it stopped. No one knows why the tombstone vibrates.

Later that year I was at the cemetery with my daughter doing some research and she saw something moving around in the enclosed cemetery. Since this is a private cemetery, I walked up there and in the cemetery we say a lady in a long gown. She wasn't walking, sort of floating, we couldn't see her feet. We both stood there and watched her float towards the vibrating stone. She disappeared. When we walked up the the grave you could see footprints in the dirt and the stone was vibrating. I told my father about it and he said that the woman buried there died before her husband and her husband had erected the stone with his name on it. Later he remarried. When he died, his 2nd wife had him buried in her family's plot.

What me and my daughter saw was her searching for her lost husband.

A s you may have noticed, crazy things seem to surround me, mostly at my best friend's old house. This story took place when I was 17. I was spending the night with my friend and had no time to shower before leaving my own house, so I decided to take one at my friend's. It was already night by the time I got to her house. I said once before I have always had a feeling of dread anywhere in her house, especially in the bathroom. Now my friend (Anna) had a glass shower door. You could see perfectly through it and in anywhere in the bathroom. I never shut the bathroom door because it had a habit of getting stuck only on me and would not open until Anna would force it open. Mind you, now there was nothing wrong with this door.

I was showering with the door open that night so it wouldn't get stuck. Anna was sitting in the living room watching TV, the living room is on the other side of the bathroom wall. There is no way to see it from the bathroom and vise versa. When I had turned around to face the bathroom door, I saw someone standing in the door way. Something dressed in black. It appeared to be peeking around the corner. So thinking Anna was playing a trick on me, I immediately asked ""Anna are you standing in the door way?"" she replied, ""no I'm sitting in the living room still..."" I freaked, opened the door to the shower and saw it. This thing was almost wrapped around the side of the wall with its head twisted around and pressed to the wall. It was like it had turned its head completely upside down, but was standing. It stayed there for a moment just staring and twisted until I yelled for Anna. I yelled frantically for her to get in to the bathroom. By the time she got there it was gone.

I didn't see where it went it, just sort of disappeared like it was never there. When Anna got to the bathroom, she looked everywhere for something that may have been giving some sort of reflection, but nothing was found.

I finished showering rather quick and made Anna stay in the doorway until I was done. Also, the front and back door were visible to where Anna was sitting in the living room so no one was able to sneak past her and into or out of the house without her seeing them. We tried numerous times to duplicate the contortion of the image I had seen, but were unable to.

We are not sure what or who it was until this day and I haven't seen it since then. I am now very leery about showering at other people's houses.

Strange Sleeping Experience,"California, United States",Old Hags / Night Attacks / Sleep Paralysis,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Old Hags / Night Attacks / Sleep Paralysis :: Strange Sleeping Experience

M y name is Stephanie and I am still a young adult. I was trying to find out what had happened to me last night and this is a site that I had found. But now that I am writing it, I think I'm at the wrong place maybe. Last night I was sleeping and I had just started to drift off when all of a sudden something very scary happened. I am a christian and try to be religious, although lately I am somewhat not doing as well as I should be. But this is what happened next.

I felt my self saying over and over the words ""Lord please help me and be with me and in my dreams tonight"". After repeating it many times, it felt like something or someone wanted me to stop and I felt like my heart stopped and I could no longer breathe and I felt like I was trying to say it, but they did not want me to and I was so scared. Then I'm not sure If I really had said this aloud, but I felt like the thing that was trying to stop me took over my body for a minute and I felt paralyzed and a weird voice took over mine as I was trying to ask help from the Lord. Then suddenly I woke up sort of out of breath and horrified.

I immediately thought of a demon or something, having seen scary movies such as the exorcism of emily rose. I have heard of sleep paralysis. Is this what it is? Or is something trying to take over my body? All I know is that it scared the living crap out of me and I want to know what happened. I'm still pretty young so I went into my mother's room and tried to sleep in her bed. I was so scared but eventually fell asleep.

There has to be someone with this same occurrence or something like this. I want to know. Thanks.

A True Boyfriend,Philippines,Family / Friends Visits,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Family / Friends Visits :: A True Boyfriend

T his is a story about my friend who has a very tragic experience, her name is Joan (not her real name), Joan is a very good friend of mine, she had a boyfriend who's name is Leon (not his real name), Joan and Leon are lovers for almost 3 years. Last month May 20, 2007 we had a conversation with Joan in the phone, she called me up at exactly 3am, because she had a very strange nightmare.

She told me that Leon is very pale in her dreams and his hair was scattered looks like he was from bed, and his eyes was red and bloody it looks like his crying with blood, begging for help and he is holding three roses. Joan wants to help him but she can't reach his hand, his too far, she tried to run towards him but she can't move her legs for it was too heavy. Then a very loud echo came into her ears and because of that, she woke up and when she woke up, she found herself crying and her bed was all scattered.

She started to think about Leon, because she is very worried about him so, she called Leon but the line was busy, she tried dialing the numbers again and again but still very busy, when she looked at her side, she saw a very strange shadow, a very black shadow, when she closed her eyes, to her surprise the shadow was gone and there and then, she called me up so, that's the time she told me everything, and her voice was so weak.

And I told her ""Wag kang mataranta andito nman ako eh, pupuntahan natin si Leon sa bahay nila mamayang 8:00am wag ka nang umiyak birthday mo pa naman"" (translation: ""don't panic I am here, we will just go to Leon's house at 8am, don't cry it's your birthday! don't you remember?"") I told her in a very worried voice, so there she started to calm down, and when 8:00am struck, we went to Leon's house, but to our surprise, no Leon showed up, instead her mother told us that he died of a murder, he died because he was protecting Joan from the man as he was walking along the street.

This man was Joan's stalker, but Joan already had a boyfriend so he planned to rape Joan on her birthday. Leon was walking along the street towards the house of Joan to surprise her for her birthday, but the incident happened when Joan dreamt of him crying with blood at exactly midnight. The people found him lifeless, still holding the three roses he bought just for Joan. Joan was stunned and was shocked and she never stopped crying until a very cold wind passed by and and cold air passed by her cheeks so gently, and a voice saying, ""I'll always be here for you HAPPY BIRTHDAY MY DEAR!"". And the wind stopped and there we never stopped praying for his soul, for my friend's birthday became a very tragic death of his boyfriend.

Crowds of Little Orbs in my Shower,United Kingdom,Orbs / Lights / Mists,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Orbs / Lights / Mists :: Crowds of Little Orbs in my Shower

O ne night, about 8.30pm, I was getting ready to go out with my mates for a girlie night out at the Point. I was about to get into the shower but the bathroom felt really really cold. A few minutes later, I felt it again, but the bathroom windows were closed, I thought it was a draft so I looked in my bedroom to see if the windows were opened, but they weren't. I went back into the bathroom and forgot about it,  when I was getting into the shower, I saw little these wee white strange shape things going round and round non stop. There was about 7 of them, 2 of them were a very strange shape and the rest were just like white patches.

About 15mins later, I was thinking to my self what they were and I couldn't figure them out, so then I rang my friend and told her I might be a little late, like about 10 mins or 15 mins or so, and she says that's ok. Later, when I got off the phone, I went into the bathroom again and as soon as I turned the knob of the shower power and got in, there was this strange white figure shape, it was a face but not just a face, it kept on disappearing and coming back again. I just thought it was my reflection from the mirror but it wasn't, it was some little orbs and a strangely ghostly face... how scary. I ran out of the shower and grabbed my towel and ran as fast as I could

It was about 10:00 and I was supposed to be there like 30mins ago, but I was too scared to go back upstairs again. I was wondering what I was going to do. I was so scared that I started to cry. I went back upstairs again, carefully so that I couldn't get the ghosts attention, I went in and said ""if you are present, please move something or do something"" and the ghosts or orbs smashed my mirror. I was in a deep deep shock... I wanted to get rid of them, but I can't. If you do know please leave a message or contact me on this email XxsweetiesxX [at] hotmail [dot] co [dot] uk

Later, I was trying to comfort them by talking to them, but it made it much much worse, so then I tried to say mean things to them like ""ghosts are ugly wee things, they are pure clear see through white!""

The ghosts were against me and I was wondering what they were going to do with me and the room felt much much warmer. After that, these orbs and ghosts still have been haunting me and my shower is broken and the plumber has tried to fix it and I told them that there was a strange ghost in my house, but they didn't believe me...

So the shower is never ever go to work, no matter what the plumbers do. I sold my house to these couples that were just married. In my new house, there is something really really strange going on but I don't know what it is. I am selling my house again but I hope I will live in a house where there are no ORBS OR GHOSTS.

The Victorian House,"New York, United States",Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: The Victorian House

I t was April 18, 2003. It was a decent day outside. I had been visiting my Grandma that weekend for an early Easter gathering with the family. My Grandma had 7 kids including my mom. They lived in a big victorian house on 97. My mom was the last one born but they had been living in that house for a long time before then. My Grandma had finally been getting ready to sell this mansion type house.

I wanted to visit it one last time before it was officially gone. There were three floors, a kitchen, dining room, game room, even an indoor pool! Basically the house was huge! As I walked through the house alone I had hoped to encounter unexplainable event! That's just me being me... Well my wish came true! As I reached the second floor, I had heard footsteps coming from my uncle's old bedroom! I was a little creeped out but excited at the same time. I said, ""hello"", but no reply. So I just went on doing my business. About 5 or 10 minutes later, I felt a cold breeze on my neck. My Grandpa had died about four months before I was born and same with my Uncle. His footsteps had been heard recently in the bedroom on the third floor. That's when I got creeped out and left. I told no one.

As the lady bought the house and moved in a couple weeks later her, husband committed suicide. Later on, she started experiencing the same things I had and told my Grandmother who had told me. I immediately went to the house and talked to her about it and we stay in contact from time to time again. If you have any questions leave a message or email me at hii_kenzz12 [at] yahoo [dot] com, I will reply as soon as I get them. Thank You... Hope you enjoyed!

Ghost in the Car,"Alaska, United States",Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: Ghost in the Car

T uesday night, about ten years ago, me, my mom, Melanie and grandma, Julie were driving in Kenai. It was pitch black and raining really hard. We saw a woman with black hair hitchhiking. So we picked her up. What was so strange about it all was that she didn't say anything the whole time. She just pointed and nodded. She pointed to the house she wanted to go to, and we dropped her off and as soon as she got out. I looked back and she wasn't there, there was no lights on in the house at all. She just disappeared!

The house was a bit familiar, it looked a lot like my house and then it dawned on me that WAS my house! So I told my mom and we got so freaked out and went to the police. My mom told them what happened so they said that it must of been some of my friends from school just pranking us.

The next night, I saw a woman standing in my bedroom doorway. So I screamed. My mom came rushing in the door, she walked right through the woman, then the woman disappeared. I told my mom what had happened so she decided to call a priest. When he came over, he said he was going to do a reading on the house. When he was finished, he said we had three entities in and around our house. He said that one of them was evil and the other two were good. He said the spirits were all sisters, including the woman hitchhiker and the woman in my doorway, so he helped them find the light and they went to heaven.

Weird Things Happening in my House,"North Carolina, United States",Poltergeists / Physical Manifestations,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Poltergeists / Physical Manifestations :: Weird Things Happening in my House

M y name is Rosa. I live in NC. I'm currently 16. The house that we live in, we have had lived in for 4 years. Weird things have been happening. It was a hot summer day, back when I was 14, it was late at night and my brother was on the floor sleeping so I got up and put him on the bed. When I carried him, I saw this lady by the bathroom door. I was scared out of my mind! I thought I was just me seeing things. I was just looking at her, and she was staring hard at me. I didn't know how to react, so I just turned around to look away and then I turned back to see if she was there. She was gone. She was wearing a white long dress. DARK DARK black hair, pale. That was my first experience.

A month later, my dad said that he saw the bathroom trash can move. Later that same day, my aunt had visited us, she had just come from California. I was sitting across from her and I was beside my dad. I saw the plate move, I thought I was just me again, but my dad said he saw it too. We were freaked out, but we just let it go.

My dad one day left to go to mexico for an emergency, so my mom and me were alone in the room. It was around 3 o'clock in the morning. I swear I heard someone open the main door of our house, and hear big foot steps, as if he/she was wearing boots. I was scared, thought my dad came home, or if he forgot something. Or if someone came into our house to rob. Then, I heard him/her sit down in the couch, and that couch squeaks every time you sit down. Well it did, then he/she got up and walked down the hall way. I was so scared, I was too scared to move. Then he stopped at my bedroom door and then kept walking. Later it went to my sister's room and then disappeared. I didn't hear no more noises. I was scared and woke up my mom and we looked everywhere and there was nothing in our house. My mom says that she hears boots or heavy foot steps in our house back then when my dad use to go to work around 4 in the morning.

A month ago, me and my sisters were alone home. So we were just sitting in our sofa and watching TV, then we heard like as if someone wanted to open the door. But it was no one because we looked at our window. Then the spoons, and the pan fell. We thought it was because we just had finished washing dishes. Then as soon as they fell, the TV turned off then on. I knew it wasn't on timer because if you put it on timer, it wouldn't just turn on again. Then I told my dad and mom and they didn't believe me. Then a few minutes later, The tv turned off and on again. They thought it was because the power went out, but I told them no because the computer didn't shut down or restart.

Last summer, me and my dad and my other sister (and brother), went to mexico for vacation. My mom, sister, and my baby sister where home by themselves, and said that they heard someone knocking the door, but that it was nobody because they looked out the window, she said they kept knocking but they didn't open the door because they didn't see nobody there. My mom said that it wasn't the first time that it had happened.

Well, last week, I went to the restroom, and I saw the curtains move, and then the toilet paper fell. It was odd. I just went to the bedroom, and couldn't go to sleep!

Sll that I know, if it's a spirit or ghost, I don't think it wants to do anything bad. Hopefully not... What do you think? The only thing that really freaked me out was that man (sounded like it, because of its heavy boots). Lately nothing happened.

Things Appear When I Turn Around,"Tennessee, United States",Psychic / Medium,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Psychic / Medium :: Things Appear When I Turn Around

A ll through my life I have always seen things when I turn around. They were not normal, I never really mentioned anything to anyone about this. Just recently was the first time I had ever mentioned it. I was at my friend's house and we were playing a card game and I turned around to look at the t.v. And when I turned back around, I saw this black image like it was just a blur. I could tell it had a head but I could tell if it was touching the ground or not. This was just one of the many times this has happened.

I never typically get a good look of what this is. It freaks me out but it doesn't scare me, it's just weird. One of the best images I have gotten of what this was when I was outside shooting basketball and I turned around to look at my neighbors yard and I saw this image. I could tell it was a man and he was tall and had a white robe on and long brown hair. Now when I see these images, I don't know if I should be scared or if it really matters or not. When these images appear, they come at random. I will only see them in black or in white. They never come when it's loud or when I'm doing anything important.

I just really don't know what to think about it. I'm not sure if they are watching me and if they are how long they have been. One more thing, it just seems like when I'm going to bed, it feels like there is someone in there with me and I don't know if that would pertain to this also.

The Face,Australia,Apparitions / Voices / Touches,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Apparitions / Voices / Touches :: The Face

I have been hearing noises, footsteps, and felt I was being watched for the past 3-4 years and I wasn't expecting to see something/somebody... What I saw wasn't a whole body or very detailed as it was a face fading as I saw it.

It was 3am, I had just got off the computer and I laid down in bed, I was just getting comfortable and closed my eyes for like 2 seconds, I opened them and a face was fading in front of me. I jolted back a bit but didn't feel a presence so I thought nothing of it, but remembered the features just in case. It was a male, with longish dark brown hair & a beard.

2 days later at 1-2pm, I decided to go for shower, I was walking towards my bathroom and then I saw the face again in my brother's room which is a meter and bit away from the bathroom. And that time I did feel a presence. I stopped and went straight to my brother's room, I stood in my brother's room and looked around but it had gone.

More things are happenning as I have been getting older. I'm 16 turning 17 now and I saw a face... I'm not sure if this is a gift maturing or I'm hearing and seeing things... Nobody else in my family has experienced any of this.

I know I'm not crazy, just wondering why its only happening to me and not my whole family.

Ghost Car,Suriname,Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: Ghost Car

I 'm so glad I found this site. I witnessed a lot of paranormal things throughout the years and now I have a place to talk about them. A few years ago, my boyfriend and I, my sister and her boyfriend went to my nephew's birthday party. He lived outside the capital city, so it was a long ride. We headed there around 6 pm and stayed until 2:00 am.

When we drove back, the road was deserted. Around that time, there wasn't much traffic on that road. At some point we noticed a pickup truck driving behind us. We weren't going too fast, but the pickup didn't attempt to pass us. It just stayed close behind us. We were getting spooked, because we thought that maybe someone wanted to ambush us. We got really spooked when my sister who was sitting in the back said she couldn't see anyone behind the wheel, or in the car for that matter!

Than suddenly the pickup gained speed and drove pass us. As it drove pass us we looked at it and to our astonishment there really was no one behind the wheel! As soon as it had passed us, it disappeared right before our eyes. I don't know how, but we managed to get home safe. Here in Suriname, we have a radio program were listeners call to relate their paranormal experiences. I phoned and told about my experience. It turned out that we weren't the only ones who had this experience. It is said that a man died on that road in a fatal car accident a while ago. He was driving a white pick up truck.

Haunted Desk,"California, United States",Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: Haunted Desk

T his occurred fifteen years ago in Oakland, California. My boyfriend and I purchased a used oak desk and were bringing it home on a flatbed trailer when one of our tires blew out. We thought nothing of the tire blowout at the time. We were in the process of moving into a new apartment and were setting up house. When we finally got home with the desk, we put it next to our bed.

The ensuing three months, my boyfriend complained that aliens were watching him. He said this almost every day. I ignored this complaint because I thought it was just stress. Finally, on the night of January 1st, I woke up looking at my desk and saw the apparition of a young man sitting there staring back at me. I thought it was a hallucination or some trick of shadows and light, so I blinked and tried to focus my eyes. The apparition remained. He wore round glasses. He had bangs that were cut straight across. He looked to be 20-something and was transparent and colorless, though I could tell that his hair was blond to light brown. The apparition lasted about 5 seconds. When he vanished before my eyes, I felt a very tall presence standing beside the bed. Then the name ""Ray"" came into my head for no reason. I felt no fear during the entire incident. While I was still lying awake, trying to figure out what to do, my boyfriend woke up and immediately said, ""Damn it! I really feel like there are aliens watching me right now!"" That's when I told him we needed to talk.

After the initial sighting, we kept the desk for three more months. The desk had always made loud cracking noises. I began to attribute those noises to the ghost. We were both pretty uncomfortable and couldn't sleep after my sighting. We finally got rid of the desk and moved to a different apartment, which solved the ""aliens watching me"" problem once and for all. And we actually sold the desk for a profit, something I've always felt guilty about.

M y friend and I had moved into our apartment in Spokane and were really excited about it. It was a historic building (built in 1904) and was one of the first hotels in town. It had been bought by a company who restored it and we loved living in a building over 100 years old.

For the first few months, we didn't notice anything out of the ordinary. Then one day my roommate told me that she had something weird happen. She said that she laid down in bed and she felt someone shaking her. Her room had no windows and so she frantically turned the light on and nothing was there. We brought up the possibility of a ghost, but I remembered that she has a history of being a very deep sleeper and often has vivid dreams. I was sure she was just dreaming and left it at that. I had slept in her room a few times before (since it was so dark) and hadn't had any problems at all.

A few months later I decided to take a nap in her room since my room was bright. I laid down and fell asleep. I awoke to a heavy weight baring down on my chest and shoulders and someone whispering in my ear. I couldn't make out what they were saying... Only a few words here and there. I was able to move and jumped awake, absolutely terrified and turned on the light. Nothing. I am pretty skeptical and just figured that although I hadn't ever had an experience like that, it MUST have been a dream. I laid back down and fell asleep again.

I was awoken again by the same thing not long after. The same pressure on my chest and whispering. I could make out the word ""you"" and it was being said frequently but I couldn't catch the rest. I jumped up again and turned on the light. Once again, nothing. I was a little more scared this time but still wanted to believe it was just a dream. So I nervously made myself get back in bed and fall asleep.

Not long after that, I woke up to the pressure on my shoulders and the whispering. Only this time it was angrier and louder. I flew out of bed and vowed to never again sleep in her room again. I was troubled by this and talked to my roommate. We both weren't sure what to do but she didn't seem afraid. So she continued to sleep in her room. For the most part, she never had issues.

Not too long after, she said that she had gotten into bed again and she heard a loud hiss and something shoved her in bed. She was so afraid she slept on the couch.

One day, I was cleaning my room and had my bedroom door open. It was the in the summer and our apartment didn't have air conditioning so all of the windows were open. I was folding clothes on my bed and saw a man in an old, dark, heavy coat standing in my doorway. I was so startled that I screamed. But he disappeared in an instant. I ran to the hall, wondering if someone had climbed through the window and no one was there. I searched the apartment and nothing. I thought it was odd he was wearing such heavy clothing on such a warm day and noticed that he had disappeared right before my eyes. I suddenly thought, ""WOW, maybe I just saw a ghost"".

The last time I had a strange ""encounter"" was a few months later. I had just gotten a dog (he was a sweet stray that I couldn't say no to). He liked to sleep in my room by my bed. I woke up in the middle of the night for some reason and saw my dog alert and looking in the doorway. I looked in the doorway and saw a dark figure of a man, also looking like he was wearing heavy clothes. Then he was gone. I woke up my friend who was staying over and we once again looked around for any sign of an intruder. Not surprisingly, we found nothing.

That was the last my roommate or I ever had anything out of the ordinary happen. I've told a few people and they all seem to believe that the dog scared our ghost off. I don't know for sure what happened, but all I do know is that is was really spooky. Like I said, I've never been a big believer and certainly never thought that I'd ever experience anything like this. I can't explain it and would like to believe that I'm not seeing things and crazy, especially since it's never been a problem in my 25 years until that apartment. We moved out a few months ago and someone else has moved in. I drove by the other day and wondered if they would ever have any similar problems.

That's my story... If anyone has any similar experiences, I'd love to hear them.

Ouija Findings,"South Carolina, United States",Ouija Board / Seances,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Ouija Board / Seances :: Ouija Findings

T wo days ago, me and my friend, Sara, found a Ouija board at her grandma's house. Sara had asked her Nana whether she owned a Ouija board, and her Nana said no. So me and Sara showed her Nana the Ouija board and we asked her Nana if we could bring it back to Sara's house since I was spending the night and her Nana said yes. Sara and I then put the board into the back of her car, and when we left we got all giddy and excited.

When Sara and I got to her house we pulled the Ouija board out of the back of the car and brought it into the house. I was getting anxious because I wanted to use it already, Sara wanted to wait but I didn't really care. I called Stevie, Sara's brother, over to the opened Ouija board box. We kept looking for a better description of it, and how it works, but we couldn't find out anything, except for the instructions and the maker, William Fuld. Stevie and I stopped caring, though, so we just grabbed a glass (because it didn't have a pointer) and put it onto the word Ouija. We went into Sara's room and started with the question, ""Is there anyone on or around this plot of land? If there is please move the cup to 'yes'..."" We felt a slight shift, but it wouldn't really fully move. So, Stevie and I waited for five minutes then eventually gave up.

We brought the Ouija board into the computer/living room where Sara was sitting, and I asked Sara if she wanted to try, and she said sure. She turned around and put her knee next to mine, and we put our hands on the cup and I opened with the question I had said earlier. The cup went straight to Yes! It turns out his name was actually George Michael Samuels and he died when he was 57 in the same neighborhood we were in. Both Sara and I kept talking to him until like 2 in the morning, but then we had to let him go because he was getting mad.

The next day, we pulled him back and we started talking to him. We eventually pieced things together and began to make him realize something. I can't tell you, though, because it was very heartbreaking to him. Well, it turns out he was murdered, stabbed in the heart. We're still trying to make him realize it, but he's always wanting to pull the cup towards 'Good Bye'. We want him to know how he died, because it seems to be what's holding him back in life. I hope he finds out that, and eventually accepts it.

Christy,"Michigan, United States",Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: Christy

T here are skeptics who will read this, but I guarantee it on my life that my experiences were real, and forever cemented my belief in spirits and the after life. I never believed in ghosts until my family moved into a very nearly condemned house. You know, fixer-upper. Big city, little money, you know the deal. We didn't know that there had been a murder in that house until after we moved away.

It took almost 2 years of continuous work, but we made that house beautiful. It was a big house, and we were renting for next to nothing because our landlady lived right next door, but it was nowhere close to perfect. Even though it was a big house, the set-up wasn't that great. My sister and I had to share a room. My other sister got to sleep in the basement, although how she did it after what started happening, I have no idea, my brother got his own room for a while, and my parents shared a room, obviously. Well, after a while, we loved the house. It was bright and had lots of windows, perfect for heating and cooling. We had a huge living room, a huge dining room, and a huge kitchen. It was perfect for our huge family.

Everything was pretty normal until we cut down the giant pine tree in the back yard. I don't know why, but I think that unsettled whatever spirits were there. I've learned since then that spirits don't like change in their environment. Some unexplainable events started happening; weird things that I could only categorize as paranormal. This wasn't the first time I had encountered paranormal activity. In another house we used to live in, we could hear the spirit of an old man walking around at night, almost as if he were on patrol. I remember one time I had gotten a balloon, and drew a face on it with a marker. As the helium started leaking out of it, it didn't sink to the floor like a normal balloon would. It seemed to be caught in the middle. It drifted from room to room, the face always pointing forward. We tried pushing it to the ceiling and to the floor, but it stayed right there in the middle drifting to each room for couple of days, until we finally found it on the floor next to the couch. We moved not long after that.

My sister and I, like I said before, shared a room. It was very easy to hear voices carry up the staircase, seeing as we were right off the landing. But sometimes we would hear someone call my name from downstairs, and no one was down there. I never felt frightened, only curious and confused. At first you try to dismiss the voices carrying up the stairs, you find excuses. Mostly you can blame it on your imagination, but that only goes so far. The reality was someone was calling my name when no one was home.

The next instance was one night, my sister was already sound asleep, but I was having trouble because I had an uneasy feeling. This would be an experience I couldn't blame on my imagination. I felt a force bear down on me while I was trying to sleep. A heavy breathing filled the room. I couldn't breathe, I couldn't move, but a minute later it passed. It was around that time I realized whatever was inhabiting that house had singled me out. The thing had never called my sister's name, even though she was hearing the same voice. It had progressed so now not only did it sound like someone was calling my name from down stairs, but right outside my door, and sometimes right behind me.

After school one day, it just so happened I was home alone for an hour or so. I decided to play with our new computer. This was only the second computer we had ever had, and this one was far better than the one before it. It was a Christmas present, and it only being February, there were still things we hadn't discovered. I found out that we had a voice recorder. So, just experimenting, I let it run the entire time through, without saying anything. I wanted to know what it would sound like if I just let the recorder run. Well, playing it back normal, I heard something that I knew I hadn't heard while recording. There was no noise made during that time, not even a squeak from my chair. The bird was even unusually silent, which is strange, because usually she whistled like a maniac whenever she knew there was someone within earshot. Well, the noise was almost indecipherable, but hearing it a couple times through, it sounded like a cry for help. What was exactly said was "" Noooo! Doooon't!"" It was a very pitiful sound, of someone wailing, especially if you can't identify who or what that someone was.

As soon as someone got home, I let them listen to it. They brushed it off; saying that it was an effect from the computer, or that could have been a car driving past. But how can they explain the unmistakable sound of someone, a woman none-the-less, saying ""no, don't"". And our house is silent, unless windows are open. We were set back far enough from the road to where we couldn't hear the cars if all the windows and doors were closed, and being February, they were. My mom said it could have been the heat vent, but since when do heat vents talk? I recorded in complete silence; nothing could disprove the existence of that voice on our computer. Of course I saved it, and tried to record in total silence again, but it was a rare afternoon that I got alone. With 6 people in your family, hardly a moment goes by when at least one person isn't home.

Finally, after all of that, I saw her. I knew it was a girl, or a woman, because whenever we heard someone call our names, it was a woman's, and I had recorded a woman's voice. I had gone into the basement to put a load of laundry into the washer. My sister's basement room was right next to the laundry room, and there was no wall that separated it, only a long table, and a chair move against the washer. When you are looking straight at the washer, or in my case, in it, you can see the chair slightly out of the corner of your eye. I bent down to pick up some more clothes from the basket I had brought down, and when I straightened, I saw out of the corner of my eye, a figure that hadn't been there a second ago sitting in the chair.

As soon as I looked directly at the chair, there was nothing there. It didn't take but half a second, but her image had been burned into my memory forever. She had long dark hair, very straight, ending near the middle of her back, wearing a red v-neck shirt that was form fitting, and a black skirt that seemed to be made of leather, ending right above her knee. She was light skinned, and fairly modern looking. I hear a lot about hauntings by spirits that had died hundreds of years ago, but not her. She had to have died within the last 10 years. The funny thing about seeing her though is her image was blurred, but her face is even more so. I could tell exactly what kind of clothes she was wearing, but I couldn't tell anything about her face because it was so blurred.

One night, my sister was having a get-together with a bunch of friends. My mom had just bought a digital camera to go with our new computer. It was a new toy that we all started taking pictures with. We took a whole bunch of group shots, and funny poses. I remember we only took 21 shots, because I was the one who took most of the pictures. My mom loaded the pictures onto the computer and there, in between frames 17 and 18, with no number attached to it, was a girl with long dark hair, a red shirt, and black skirt, sitting on the couch, looking straight forward. We caught her profile, and she looked exactly the same as when she was in the basement. I recognized her instantly. It was an odd picture, because the entire frame was out of focus, and she was faintly outlined. Her feet seemed to disappear, and let me just say, it scared the heck out of every girl at that party. Also, no one was wearing a red shirt. Not even my brother. It had to be Christy.

Christy was the nickname I gave her for unexplained reasons. It was just a name that popped into my head one day, and that was her name. It wasn't too long after the discovery of Christy that we decided to sell our new beautiful house and find somewhere bigger.

About a week after our move, my mom came to me with a newspaper clipping from 1993. All she did was apologized for not believing me and asked me to read it. It turns out a girl, about 17 years old, only a few months older than me, was murdered by her drunken father over an undisclosed altercation in our house. She had been shot in the face with a shotgun. And, I kid you not, the picture in the paper was a school photo, she had long dark hair, and a red v-neck shirt. If the picture were bigger, I would have bet money she had on a black leather skirt. Her name was Tiffany Katherine Postell.

I just wish there was a way I could have helped her. She targeted me, not in a mean spirited way, but almost as if she were crying for help, and I was the one she was asking. If there was a way I could go back there, I would.

3:00  AM Awakening,"Pennsylvania, United States",Poltergeists / Physical Manifestations,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Poltergeists / Physical Manifestations :: 3:00  AM Awakening

M y cousin Travis (age 12) and me, 10, at the time were staying at his house and before we went to sleep he said ""I have to warn you something will happen at 3:00 tonight"" and well, knowing Travis, I thought he was just trying to scare me. I was wrong.

It was hard for me to fall asleep from what he said. I finally fell asleep at 1:00 and at 3:00 in the morning, I felt a light shaking and I thought it was my aunt, so I said ""Aunt rockie 5 more minutes"". I was wrong it wasn't my aunt rockie, whatever it was, it shook harder and harder and I burst up from my bed to see no body in sight. I shook travis and I said to him ""Something just shook me half to death"" (I was crying of fear) and he said ""I told you that you were going to get a mean awakening at this time"" and I asked why, according to him, every night at 3:00, something shakes him and so I asked why it shook me tonight, he said it was probably because I was new there and it wanted me to know it was there, but still, to this day, I am 17 now, and I am still afraid of that house and I never knew what that thing was.

Please if you have any idea what that thing was please comment and tell me!

Sane or Insane? That is the Question,"Florida, United States",Apparitions / Voices / Touches,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Apparitions / Voices / Touches :: Sane or Insane? That is the Question

I don't really know how to start... Or what to say. My story isn't as interesting or long as most on here. I guess I'll just start off with an introduction. I'm 15 years old, I know I'm young but I seek an answer. I know none of you can give it to me, but maybe guidance to it. I don't just have one story, and the four I am going to tell you, I can't promise are the only stories. I'm sure I may have experienced more, but memory is not on my side.

The first of the ""incidents"" starts off with me being thirsty or hungry. I really can't remember. I was walking to the kitchen, I don't remember the time, but it was dark. The kitchen light was off and I walked to the fridge, but as I was walking, I started to feel shocked. My legs were walking slower and as if they get sticking... not to the floor... just... sticking... I don't really know how to explain it. As I neared the fridge I saw a dark shadowy figure coming towards me, it was maybe 2-3 feet away.

I was shocked of course, but too shocked to be frightened. In haste I opened the fridge door; light illuminating the kitchen, the figure had disappeared. This was in my Michigan home in Kentwood mind you. Other times I would be in my room, it would be night, and the light could be on or off. I would just feel suddenly scared. I'd look around and nothing would be there.

A few months and a long story later I move to the Florida Keys. I start seeing my boyfriend Chad, we were together when this happened and are still together now. We lived on Cudjoe Key at the time of this happening. We were sitting on the futon (our living room couch at the time) and my head was resting on his shoulder.

Slowly I started to fall asleep, my eyes drifted close, and right at the exact point where sleep was about to befall me, I heard someone whisper ""Jessi"". Jessi is my name by the way. Hi. I really wasn't going to state my name, but for this story I suppose it's sort of necessary. I opened my eyes right when it happened. I felt like I was about to cry, but I wasn't sad or scared. I had a chill down my spine also. I just let go of it though, and passed it off like I did the ""fridge guy"".

Now to the third experience I had. This wasn't too long ago, in the house I live in now. Maybe a week or two. Possibly a little longer. I went to grab Chad and a pop, it was dark, and we have a long hallway where at the very end is the bathroom, to the left is my sister's room, and to the right mine and Chad's room.

I was walking down the hallway, and suddenly I just felt scared. I quickened my pace a little, and right when I was turning into the little dip where my door is, I heard that whisper again: ""Jessi"". I didn't exactly run into the room, more of a very un-sophisticated power walk. Chad was looking at me smiling like ""what the hell?"" I again passed it off. I just replied with a smile and said ""Just afraid of the dark, you know...""

Now, for my last story, it too happened this month. I don't remember which happened first though, the experience you've just read, or this. My sister Kortni was calling my name, and I walked out of my room just as she was walking out of hers. Now let me explain something a moment, our bathroom door opens in, and the doorknob is on the left side. The door was ajar about 3-5 inches. Now as I took more attention, I saw something roundish, face-shaped, through the crack of the door, but it was right where the door was. I hope you understand me, I'm no good with explaining myself as you see. So I looked over, and saw what I thought was a face, except it was only the outline of the face, no eyes, no nose, no mouth, no body. Though I didn't really have time to look closely at the face because I looked away so quickly. Once I saw it, I did one of those quick deep inhales, and grabbed onto the corner of the wall for support, I felt as if I was going to fall. I looked back and it wasn't there.

My sister looked at me strangely and again, I just smiled and passed it off, saying ""Nothin', just thought I seen something..."" I thought about it, and maybe it was just one of those light flashes you get from looking at something bright. Except, Chad and I had the light off and were watching tv. So maybe, maybe not.

What made me wonder if I was seeing/hearing things or not, is me and my sister had a talk on our porch the other day. She told me she was taking out the trash once, and it felt like a hand touched her arm. Gently though.

My questions are, does it seem I'm hallucinating? Or am I really being... ""haunted""? By a ghost? Also, I really don't have much knowledge in the paranormal, only random things I read, and what I see on ""Ghost Hunters"" if the show is in fact true. Which I believe it is. So for my question, can ghosts go anywhere? Or do they stay confined to one place?

Girl in Green,"Missouri, United States",Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: Girl in Green

I have seen a girl in green in my house ever since we first moved in when I was 5 (I'm 16 now). I usually see her in my parents' doorway out of the corner of my eye. She is about 5'3"" and wears a green velvet dress that's a late 19th century style. She has dark brown hair that's pulled into a loose bun. I have seen her many times. She usually is walking into the room and as she does, she looks over her shoulder at me. She looks to be about my age. I have also seen her in our basement and staring at me in the middle of the night next to my bed.

I am scared to mention it to my family. They are all deeply religious and refuse to believe in ghosts. I felt like I was just crazy until my boyfriend was over one night. No one was upstairs but us. I was in the bathroom, but he didn't know that. When I came out he had ran up to me and started franticly telling me that he thought he had seen me walk into my parents' room when he looked for me. He walked across the room to the door and saw a girl who he thought was me go into their bathroom. He says he heard the drawers opening in there and things being moved around. But when he went in, there was no one there. Then I came into the room behind him and he started freaking out.

I don't know why she is in our house, we are the first ones to live here. The spirit seems pretty nice. Not evil. It's just upsetting when I'm home alone.

He Sees Me,"Idaho, United States",Misc,"I was crying. In my room and all alone, I cried myself to sleep for almost a whole week. How was I to know the guy I liked didn't like me really. He just used me to get to my sister. You see, my sister and I are the best of friends with huge personality differences. She does sports, she has many friends at school, she goes on dates almost every weekend while I am shy, I do ballroom dancing and the Arts, and flirting with guys just doesn't come naturally to me. So when this guy was flirting with me and taking me out to dances and all the fun stuff that this perfect guy could dream up, I thought that maybe I wasn't as unpopular as I thought I was. Then one hot summer night, he broke the news to me that ""he didn't mean to let it become this"" and ""he was so sorry"" but ""I want to know your sister"". And that is when I started to cry myself to sleep that long and slow week.

Twelve-thirty rolled around and awake I sat, teary eyed and just miserable in the window sill staring out into the darkness. Every time I thought of him, a fresh round of tears would swell up and fall down my face and make the ends of my hair wet and salty. It had been five nights he had my sister out late, and five nights since I had a good night's sleep. I couldn't stand being in my room any longer. I didn't want to see his car pull into my driveway again and make my broken heart throb in agony. And I didn't want to cry any more. Angry, frustrated, and sad, I opened up my window, pushed the screen out, and climbed out into the warm, summer darkness.

Bare feet hardly making a sound on the pavement, my shadow following me as I passed street lights, I walked down the road. I was never one to go out in the night. I had never snuck out before. I never even really thought about walking the empty blocks at night. But it felt good. There was nobody to see me, nobody to look out there window at me, no one to drive pass me on the street, no one. Although I am usually alone, that night I felt completely alone. The night air felt wonderful in my emptiness. There was no body to ask ""what's wrong"" when I know they really don't care.

The park was so still and so dark. Blackness lay beyond the trees, the play ground was so still and quiet, everything was just mysterious and new to me. I really did like this new world of darkness. The crickets chirped loudly and the stars shone brightly as I ran off into the trees. The grass was cold on my feet as I ran.

""It's almost as cold as Adam!"" I said coming between my two favorite climbing trees. They were so beautiful in the night's dim light. I looked between there boughs and up into the stars, those hot tears springing back into my eyes.

""How could you lie to me?"" I cried angrily. ""How could you use me? Why couldn't you be the Prince Charming you pretended to be? I didn't do anything to you? Why did you want to hurt me?""

I couldn't say anymore. I was sobbing too hard. I stood there between my trees sobbing until I passed out, or something. For the next thing I know I'm lying on the cold ground, not moving, not crying.

""She's trying to die, oh no,"" a voice far away yet right next to me said. I wanted to let out a breath, a voice, or move my eyes, but I couldn't. I could hear something move right close to my ear and then the voice came back. ""You can't die,"" he said. ""I don't think it's your time...""

I still couldn't move. I was scared. Some guy was speaking right in my ear and I was paralyzed. I heard him move again and the next thing I know, he's laying next to me so he can look at my face. A man, young, handsome, and very pale looked at me with black eyes matching mine.

""How a man can hurt a woman, I don't know,"" he said. Nothing he was saying made sense to me. ""But that is no reason to die. Dying is not the answer to every problem...""

I managed to let out a very small breath and an even smaller moan while trying to speak. ""I'm sorry, what was that?"" he said. I could now blink and move my eyes. I saw this tall figure was wearing church clothes. I looked back at him and tried to speak again.

We laid there for who knows how long. But I laid there silent while he talked to me about who knows what. I soon enjoyed just hearing him talk about everything and nothing.

""I need to go home,"" I told him and climbed slowly to my feet. He stood up too, watching me the whole time.

""Yes,"" he said, ""It is rude of me to keep a lady out this late...""

""There need to be more gentlemen like you in the world,"" I told him.

""Ahhh..."" he said and gave me, a complete stranger, a hug. I have never had a hug like that in my life. ""I'm not in the world..."" He said. ""But let me warn you before I leave, never count on dying to fight pain. Even when others you love do, they'll wait patient until you join them...""

He sent me off home and I ran the whole way. I never understood what he meant by his last words until the very next winter. My grandfather died unexpectedly, my cousin took his life, my dog was poisoned and died in my lap, and my uncle passed away of cancer. But the young gentleman's words were always in my head.

My True Experience with an Incubus,"Maine, United States",Succubus / Incubus / Sexual Ghosts,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Succubus / Incubus / Sexual Ghosts :: My True Experience with an Incubus

I feel some trepidation in writing about this or speaking about it to anyone--for fear of sounding mad. So far I have only shared it in brief e-mails with a Shamanic healer friend of mine and a liberal psychiatrist friend. But it feels like writing about it may be healing, so here goes...

About 6 weeks ago, well, actually it started long before that. About 15 years ago I learned how to use the dowsing rods to dowse another person's electromagnetic field. Dowsing is commonly used to find water underground with a pair of ""L"" shaped metal rods or a ""Y"" shaped apple or willow branch. However, it can be used for many other things as well. There is an American Dowsing Society if anyone is interested in that. However, as a metaphysical counselor my job was to help people to understand the relationship between their body and their mind. And I used the rods to dowse a client's aura and help them to attain physical healing through spiritual healing,. It allowed me to see where their aura was low or expanded. A low area indicates an energy blockage in that part of the body--and a concomitant spiritual /mental/emotional blockage. By unblocking the latter three, the physical would heal.

Over the ensuing decade and a half, using the rods evolved into being able to contact my spiritual guides. I found that they could move the rods in answer to my questions that could be answered with a yes or a no--yes being spread and no being closed or crossed. However, it soon became apparent that the rods could also be be moved by ""low influences"" as I called them. If I kept my questions to purely spiritual matters, the answers were of high quality. The rods seemed to be particularly useful for my guides to help me to understand my dreams. I also had some success with using them to prescribe homeopathic and herbal remedies for myself, my clients and even my cat.

So that's where I was until six weeks ago or so. I was happily doing counseling and using the rods for guidance for myself and my clients. Then things started to happen. I had taken on a client who was undergoing a particularly horrific ordeal. She was in the middle of a high-conflict divorce case from an abusive man and there was a pitched battle going on for custody of their six year old daughter.

It soon became apparent to me that the child was being sexually abused by the father. The mother had described in graphic detail how he had verbally, emotionally and physically abused their child. It had all started with him pinning the child to the floor when she was 2.5, in order to force medicine into her mouth. He would straddle her and kneel on her shoulders. When the child would wake at night with night terrors, the father would yell and scream at her, pin her down, lock her in her room, not allow the mother, my client, to go to her. It got much worse, but I could get totally lost in the long list of abuse.

The really hard part for me was that I am very familiar with the common sequelae of child sexual abuse and it became increasingly clear to me that the father was also doing that to the child. The mother was shocked to hear me say so--and then she said that some part of her knew it must be going on. The mother herself had been sexually abused as a child--as well as abused in many other ways. I myself am a survivor of childhood sexual abuse. This last fact becomes important in the rest of my story.

I have done much healing around that issue and have counseled other women with a similar background, but this particular case moved me deeply because of the helplessness of the mother and particularly the child. The mother is a fine person, and originally was given custody of the child during the divorce. However, a corrupt court appointed guardian came into the picture. They are called Guardian Ad Litems and have a lot of influence with judges in divorce cases. Theoretically, the G.A.L. Is supposed to advocate for the child--watch out for her best interest--But the one assigned to my clients case was just plain evil.

She apparently had fallen in in love with the husband, they began having an affair and she began advocating for him in court--instead of the child. She got custody of the child taken away from the mother in December and the child has been in a living hell since. It is now June. All of her symptoms of abuse became much worse. She developed a vaginal infection and would have rage attacks and spout profanity that would make the child in The Exorcist sound like an angel by comparison.

She was not possessed by an other-world demon though, but by a demon from this world--her father--whose language she copied. My heart went out to this sweet little girl who was being destroyed by this terrible man and I became over-involved in the case. I think it was because it reminded me so intensely of my own experience of helplessness with my own demon-father. So I began writing a 46 page letter to the state attorney general and the chief judge to try and help this child and my client. Part of it was the aforementioned lengthy list of sexual abuse symptoms. Unfortunately, as I wrote the details of the child's symptoms and and matched them to classic signs of abuse, I began retraumatizing myself. I have Post Traumatic Stress Disorder--and so does the child. I knew that writing the letter was very hard--but I didn't really understand what was happening to me.

As I was writing the letter strange things began to happen to me. I began to be able to hear my guides as voices in my head before the rods gave an answer, and less and less did I need the rods at all. Then one of the guides distinguished himself as a separate entity from the group--a healer or physician--and he actually proved his ability by finding some unusual remedies for me on the internet. As I worked more and more closely with him he began to say very flattering things to me. Soon he was saying that I was very unusually gifted and he wanted to have a personal relationship with me. Soon, to my shock, he said that it was possible for a being from his realm--which I thought was very high--to have a kind of sex with someone in my reality--the Earth plane. So, one day he asked if he could show me how and I said yes--having ""fallen in love"" with him (which now creeps me out totally--knowing what I know now).

He said I should lie quite still in my bed, then I felt I growing sexual sensation in my loins which reached a very high pitch, something like an orgasm in a few moments. It felt quite wonderful and I thought it was all a part of this amazing other-worldly love I had found. I writhe in shame now, to think I could have been such a fool. But I bought it hook line and sinker. He reeled me in and many times a day and during the night he would do this sexual energy thing to me. I would be weak in the knees and dizzy if I were standing. The sensations were very real and very physical--leaving me physically wet, my heart racing and my respiration quite elevated. It would happen anywhere, any time. He usually asked first, ""If I ""wanted to go"" and I would say yes or no. He seemed to respect my no's.

I asked the other guides if this was acceptable behavior and they said yes. They said it was extremely unusual--but since I was such an elevated being on my plane (gag) it was all right. So we did this for a week or two and then some other beings I had been working with began to object. He then built a special energy ""nest"" for us where we could be alone. Usually there was no privacy and anyone in his realm could know what we were doing.

Things got even more bizarre at that point. And I can only say that although this sounds like schizophrenia--it is not. I have since researched this ""hearing voices"" phenomenon and there are world wide organizations and support groups to help people understand this. It is not always ""mental illness"". Sometimes it is. I will add some relevant links at the end of my epic saga.

So he--who called himself ""George"" since I had trouble with his spirit name-- built this supposedly safe nest where he could take me and we could make love in private--and he took me there and we made love again several times and then suddenly he stopped and said, ""I hear something outside."" So he left to investigate. Then I heard a great commotion outside and he shouted something like ""Save yourself!"" He said he was being attacked by demons or aliens or something and that they were attacking me too--setting my hair on fire and clawing my body. I couldn't really feel it--but his description was vivid so I sort of fought them off for awhile as he directed. Then I just got tired and fell asleep and nothing happened.

Sometime later he reappeared--and told me that other things had happened too. He had fallen in love with his old girlfriend again--who was a member of the group of my guides. All of a sudden it started to sound very odd--very soap-opera-ish. But, I said I was very sad to hear it but he should go where his heart was. I always tried to be so spiritual--yu-u-u-u-ck! Still later he reappeared to say that he was a liar--he admitted it with difficulty and shame (I thought). He said that he had found the sexual experience in the nest too intense and he needed to get away for awhile, so he made up the story about the old girlfriend--and he confessed he had also made up the story about the demons and some other things. It was all a fabrication. He just wanted to scare me off. So I ""realized"" that he was not as high a being as I had thought and I told him it was all over. He was very upset. He thought that by confessing that it would make it all right and we could get back together.

It is hard for me to believe that an intelligent woman such as myself (near genius IQ) could fall for all of this--but I did. And it gets even worse.

So my inner world was now starting to feel as real if not more real than my outer world. The voices of various entities talked to me often and sounded very reasonable and compassionate and loving. After the thing with George I went back to the guides and asked them if they could find another ""healer"" for me to work with--since I was used to working with one in my practice--and oddly enough the advice was often good. Whether that was because I did occasionally connect with my true guides, or whether the malicious entities simply threw a little of that in to make it more convincing, I don't know.

But a few days later they supplied me with a new healer--who looked remarkably like the old one. We soon were in the same type of ""love""/sexual relationship. But I was convinced that this was the real thing. His name was Hon and I kept confusing him with the other when we made love and I would shout out ""Oh George!"" as I hit my sexual crescendo (I laugh as I write this and also feel totally grossed out). Anyways--that always supposedly hurt him or pissed him off--so he said. But despite that our relationship grew and I soon thought I had found this even more incredible other-worldly relationship. He seemed much higher.

However, soon the dark clouds gathered again--and at this point I can't even remember what the soap opera was this time--but again we were beleaguered by those who were jealous or wished us ill. I became very distraught--began crying a lot--in this reality-- and feeling very confused. At one point , when this all began, I had had a dream in which the guides shouted at me, just as I was waking--""He's not one of us!"" I recalled that now and then also recalled a very high voice saying simply but very emphatically ""USE YOUR COMMON SENSE."" And I said at the time--""Well my common sense says that this is all nonsense and could not possibly have any real reality."" but then I got lost again after talking with Hon and what I thought were my guides.

Finally, things got really bad and confusing and I became literally hysterical--sobbing wildly, writhing in my bed and screaming at all of them to go away and leave me alone. I didn't want to talk with any of them ever again, as time and time again it was revealed that I had been duped or betrayed in some way. At that point I jumped up out of bed and told them in no uncertain terms that I was done with it all.

Then I heard insane laughter, and malevolent voices told me that they had been tricking me all along about everything. That was the first true thing I felt that I had heard since the whole thing began. They said that I did have real guides--which I still believe-- but that the incubi could mimic them and did so often to confuse me --just so they could have sex with me. I suddenly realized to my horror that I had been dealing with an incubus or a group of incubi! That was when, as unbelievable as it may sound--things got even worse.

Then the voices in my head became harassing and plaguing--running constantly--commenting on everything I did. As I would see a dish, the voice would say, ""sees a dish"" and as my eyes shifted it would name the next thing I was seeing or doing or thinking or feeling--constantly all during the day. Then I really thought I was going mad--which after doing research I no longer believe. But this stage has continued for a couple of weeks now and has been nearly unbearable at times. The voices often keep me awake all night. If I fall asleep they bring me a sexual dream and just as I am succumbing in the dream I realize it is them again and I wake myself up.

By doing research I fund lists of stratagems for dealing with these voices. I learned a number of tricks, all of which work for a little while--then the entity seems to figure it out and it doesn't work anymore. At this point I am reaching out to the two people I mentioned in the first paragraph. I know there are drugs for this--but they have side effects and don't always work--sometimes make it worse. I really don't want to do drugs. I figure it is closely related to being retraumatized by the work on the incest case. I read at one web site that 27% of incest survivors report hearing voices. So I will pursue that angle in my healing.

There seems to be less research on the sexual part. I wish I could give you a happy ending. Yesterday I started talking with the entity---instead of trying to ignore it as I had been doing for the past two weeks. Last night they allowed me one good night's sleep. But today when I tried to nap I couldn't. Reading a book or working on the computer helps to shut off the voices. For awhile gardening worked--but now it doesn't. Talking with other people usually shuts off the voices. If I can sustain an outward focus that works for awhile--but I cannot sustain it for long.

Several times my guides have started to work with me to help me rid myself of this unwelcome attention, but then the incubus has taken it over and I soon realize that I have been duped again--after following its instructions that become more and more ridiculous and exhausting. Then I break free and just do whatever I feel like doing--not what the voice is directing me to do and it gets better. But when I break its hold on me I hear the manic insane laughter again. I believe the incubus is merely a thought form--but even thought forms can be powerful. In the Bible they reference the incubi and succubi (female version) and call them ""fallen angels"". I try more and more to use my intuition and common sense. So I just keep plugging away trying this and that, hoping that something will bring me relief. I do have more and more intermittent relief it seems, although they still keep trying to stimulate me sexually. I just brace against it and fight it off. And another thing they do is to create a lot of heat on my back--then I know they are around. This too can be shaken off--but it all takes a lot of energy. I can't wait for this to be over, and I have faith that that will be the case one day. If I ever do manage to get free of them I will write a post script to this story.

The Handsome Evil,"Nevada, United States",Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: The Handsome Evil

I f you've read my other story, "" My Brother's Demon "" You'll remember Ray. But if you haven't I'll save you the issue of going to read it. Ray was an evil... Thing that resides in my home, mainly my littlest brothers room. Once we did a seance and summoned it. That was one of the worst things I have ever done. Now the thing doesn't seem to want to leave me alone. My brothers aren't here every day so I'm the only one faced with it constantly.

A lot of the time, I just feel watched. True there have been other things that watch me, but it's just me being paranoid. This is totally different, I get chills and I just don't feel like moving, and I get really sick to my stomach. And I'm generally an extremely talkative person, but when it's around I go silent, and snippy. I bite my brothers head off even if I assume he's insulting me, which is never.

Let me tell you the layout of the house real fast. You come in the front door and there is a step down, you can go left into my mom's mini living room, straight into the family room or right into the hallway.

The mini living room and the family room both go in like a circle into the dining room and the kitchen, it's all basically open, if you go to the hallway the first room you see is Darian's to the left, my parents and down further mine and Devon's right across from one another, his is a little further down, a few inches maybe. But at night when I go out to get water from the garage I'll come back and I'll always see Ray, standing at the end of the hallway.

He stands there just looking at me, I see him and I think ""serial killer"". He has cold dark eyes and slicked back longish hair, maybe like 6ft or so, he's always smirking like ""I'm going to get you"" look. He has broad shoulders and he has stubble along his jaw line. He looks so ice cold and untouchable. I don't look at him, I pass by him, inches from him and get that falling feeling in my stomach. The whole left side of my body goes numb and stings. And I finally close my door and lock it, because it just makes me feel safe.

I used to feel safe in my room, but lately I get the feeling of being watched in here too. But I'm not so much scared in here, it's like a feeling of being watched from a window. It really creeps me out.

And when I'm in my living room, I get the watched feeling, and when I'm in my mom's little area, and the kitchen, I think it maybe just the fact it's an open space, but there are cold spots in my house, one day me and my brother are going to take the digital camera and take pictures to see if there is anything there. But I'm sort of scared to see what there may be. But besides that, the area that you come into the house is really creepy for some reason and I always see something there.

The only place I really don't feel watched is in the garage. But that may just be because it's really warm and bright. And something that I found really strange is... A few weeks ago a big butterfly was dead in my garage, before the butterflies were really out. We picked it up and threw it away, the next day there was a huge moth in the same place. I don't know, I just thought it was weird.

I want to do something, but I'm afraid if it doesn't work, he'll do more than just watch me. I think if I tick him off too bad, he'll decide to actually do something. And I wouldn't be able to do anything really religious, because my parents are atheist, I'm wiccan myself. I don't have the ability to get anything like, sage for instance. I've lost the privilege of candles and incense due to the itty bitty problem that I'm a pyro... so my hands are sort of tied here.

What do I do? Just live with it, and hope it doesn't escalate?

A Spirit that Likes to Scare Me,"Virginia, United States",Apparitions / Voices / Touches,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Apparitions / Voices / Touches :: A Spirit that Likes to Scare Me

T his happened while I was younger. Before I moved to Massachusetts and for the record it had nothing to do with the haunting, I do not remember much about the house's history, however I believe there were people in it before us. So it started because I had lots of nightmares back then, these nightmares would range from things perfectly normal in a nightmare such as falling off a bridge in a car, but the thing that was really odd about them was, I could feel and experience the things even though I did not know what it felt like from any experiences. And furthermore, no matter what I tried, I could NEVER tell I was in a nightmare, I simply couldn't think of it I always thought it was real.

One of these nightmares was extremely odd, you'll want to remember this one for later. One of the nightmares I got up for some unknown reason as if possessed, looked out the window, and spotted a orange sky with a very slight purplish tint around the trees that surrounded my circle. And above one particularly tall tree flew four owls, that's all I can remember of the dream before I woke up.

Another nightmare includes one that had a continuing nightmare, the first being a large horrifying abomination that was completely black with eyes that looked like they could have been glowing yellow and infested with worms to make them look blackly bloodshot, and the second the same creature was towering over my bed just starring at me throughout the whole dream, which DID last a while.

Now here's when it gets creepy. No more dreams, one day I was in my driveway, and accidentally snapped a tree branch, as it snapped I heard a deafening ear piercing scream that nobody else appeared to hear, I do not know if it was some weird phenomenon where I heard the tree, or whether a ghost was haunting me.

The second sighting I was in bed, I looked up because I saw something, and a completely black figure crossed the hallway despite the door being open and the hallway light being on. I never saw it again but knew it wasn't a dream because I sat there in the same position paralyzed in fear for the rest of the night, in the morning I wandered out, looked where I thought the thing had walked, and immediately had a nervous breakdown just because I was that scared of what I COULD have seen, though I saw nothing abnormal.

But there was 2 more hauntings, remember the owl nightmare, because here comes a real one. For a long time I thought nothing of the fact that I would occasionally think I see owls out of the corner of my eyes. But I only saw these apparitions through windows or other glass things. And one night the day before christmas, I heard a large thump right outside my window, immediately causing me to hide under my covers screaming. It was a very large thump. But it turned out that a christmas reef had apparently fallen out of the window, but I doubt a fluffy reef could have made a noise that large alone.

And the worst was one day in bed, I felt something hurting my toe. And realized one of my feet looked really big, so I peeked under the covers, and a small owl was sort of nibbling like a friendly dog does on my toe, but in a bit more of a painful way, I immediately screamed in utmost horror and ran like the dickens out of the room to my parents, who I forced to come and see, but there was no sign of anything ever being there except my bed sheets being al upturned. However they still recall me annoying them. And that makes me know it couldn't have been a dream.

Ever since then I have been a bit fascinated with ghosts, even though even reading stories such as on this site leave me terrified no matter what I tell myself, I still like reading them. One night I always believed I saw a large pair of eyes staring at me from the far off woods between two houses, I never looked twice however. I have not experienced any hauntings in my new house.

And back in my old house, after I bought a dream catcher, all my nightmares and dreams altogether randomly stopped, and to this day I still have that same catcher on my window. And I no longer dream.

Strange Growling Sounds,Canada,Non Human Entities,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Non Human Entities :: Strange Growling Sounds

M y parents used to live in this older red house years ago. I wasn't born then when this occurred. This happened, in the mid 1970's and, before my parents lived there, a scientist lived there and he never came out of his home and was never to be seen by anyone, again! A family moved in there and one night they saw something unusual and ran out, got in their car and drove to a near by hotel. They never came back to get their belongings! A married couple with no family had moved in the house and later, moved out!

One night, her husband was on a business trip and had to stay at a hotel over night. His wife was home with her dog and she was in her bedroom reading a book. Suddenly, she heard this growling and deep breathing sound down the hallway! The dog heard it and started to growl and had its back up! Her door was closed but, she just grabbed her dog and bolted out of the room and ran down the steps that were next to her bedroom! She stayed in the kitchen with her dog all night! She was just so scared! She had told her husband when he came home the next day. They moved right away.

My parents moved in and my mother had spoken to the people as they were about to leave. The woman told my mother about what had happened to her and her dog. My mother really didn't believe it, and moved in. Later, a strange thing happened to my mom and my other siblings late one night. A strange sound was heard by my mother coming from the living room. She ran upstairs and got the children up and then, ran to the kitchen. They stayed there the rest of the night.

My father was working late hours and didn't come home until the morning. My parents did move after their new house was built. It was scary and my mother never forgot that haunted house. There was a neighbor that lived down the road and after my parents moved out, he had told my mother he would ride his bike at night and would drive by that old red house. He said, he heard strange noises coming from that house.

Another night, he saw these red, glowing eyes starring back at him from a distance next to the house! Later, the house was torn down. This all really did happen.

The Plants of Jewel Rose,"California, United States",Family / Friends Visits,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Family / Friends Visits :: The Plants of Jewel Rose

M y mother died in 1978 and two days before she died, she asked me and my older brother what we would do if she died and my mother being was in what the family thought excellent health, not taking her serious, we jokingly replied what we wanted of her estate.

Two days later my mother died of a massive heart attack. My mom had always told me that when she died, she would come back to take care of her plants. My mom was obsessed with plants and had them in every room in the house including the bathroom. The day of the funeral, later that evening, I was laying in bed at my mother's home and only God knows that this is the truth... Suddenly my mother appeared in the very dress I had buried her in. I was not asleep, and from the bed I could see down a hallway and there she was attending to one of her hanging plants that had been one of her favorite plants and she turned slowly, smiled at me and vanished.

The following day my step dad has fallen asleep on the living room couch and had broken a large sea shell that had a plant in it that was sitting on the coffee table. No one knew he had broken it. My sister and I were sitting at the kitchen table and we could see the plant on the coffee table and it moved from the center of the coffee table to the very edge of the table and I jumped up to catch it.

That is how we knew it had been broken. Mom had come back to tell us. Surely Mom was still taking care of her plants.

Shadow with Red Eyes,"New York, United States",Old Hags / Night Attacks / Sleep Paralysis,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Old Hags / Night Attacks / Sleep Paralysis :: Shadow with Red Eyes

T his happened in December of 1999. I have to start with a little background information first. I am Roman Catholic but I had never been much of a churchgoer, although I did celebrate festivals, especially the one for the Virgin Mary on December 8th. Mostly this is because of my culture since that particular celebration is a very huge deal where my family is from.

As I said before, this happened in December 1999, and specifically it was a Sunday either a week before the 8th or the week after, but definitely around that time. My family and I had been working all that day with the festivities and when we finally got home at 6pm I was beat. So I told my parents that I was going to sleep and I did.

The first thing that happened that day was that I had a nightmare and woke up. It was your normal nightmare... The one that you're being chased by something and right when it's about to catch you, you wake up. So I woke up with my heart pounding, but I auto soothed myself just like I always do when I have a nightmare until my heartbeat went down and I feel asleep again.

The next thing I know I'm looking into a totally white room, when suddenly a beautiful, female voice says to me, ""You must go through three sorrows before you find love..."" As soon as she finished saying these words, three flashes like strobe lights quickly happened. With each flash was a picture, the only one that I remember seeing clearly is the middle one, which was a knife being thrust into my heart, a classic betrayal image. Then I woke up, again, with my heartbeat racing. Again I auto-soothed myself and fell asleep again, or well... I don't know if I was dreaming or not to tell you the truth.

Next thing I know I'm looking towards my closet door and there was a shadow of a person there with red eyes that was staring at me (at this time my bed faced the attic opening and the closet door, also, I had a 3-foot statue of the Virgin Mary on my bureau next to the attic opening which my grandmother gave to me and had nowhere else to put it). I have three windows in my room, so there's always light and you can very clearly see at night because it never gets completely dark, and yet there was the shadow. This shadow thing walks towards me and thrusts his hand into my chest and slowly pulls out a silver-white cord from my body. I was horrified! I thought, ""OMG! He's taking my soul!"" So I took the cord and tried to wrest it from his hands but to no use. He kept pulling this cord from my body, and each time he pulled a bit more I actually felt myself floating out of my body! All of a sudden I remembered that the Hail Marys are supposed to guard you against all evil, so I started to pray like there was no tomorrow! After only a few Hail Marys, the thing stopped and he let go of my cord and it snapped it into me so fast that I jumped out of bed. It was like the snap of a rubber band that is being stretched and then let go, very hard and very fast. Well, I was still praying and that thing was still there looking down at me... But I heard its thoughts or I don't know, some type of communication happened because I remember him saying to me, ""You won this time... But next time, you won't be so lucky!"" Then I woke up.

Well let me tell you, my heart was racing as fast as it could possibly go... And I didn't really want to go back to sleep because I thought that something else would try and get me, when suddenly I saw movement! It was the statue! She was walking towards me! As she did, she kept growing bigger and bigger until she was human-sized. Well let me tell you folks, that was truly the last straw. I curled up into a fetal position and rocked back and forth while chanting, ""Please don't hurt me. Please don't hurt me..."" I probably peeked because I'm curious enough that I had to see what was happening and she was right beside my bed. Next thing I know I feel Her hand on my brow soothing me like a mother would when a child is frightened. As she did this, all my fears just went away and I fell asleep into a dreamless sleep.

The next morning, I remember going to class but with that in my mind. I kept thinking... Was it real? Did it really happen? Or was it just a dream? I told my friends during my lunch break about the strange dreams, since that was what I figured they were, since the alternative was just too fantastic to contemplate. When one of my friends said that at least part of my ""dreams"" weren't. BECAUSE YOU'RE NOT SUPPOSED TO REMEMBER ANYTHING WHILE INSIDE THE DREAM STATE. Well that got me worried... Because that meant that... I still don't like thinking about it too much, but I'm sure you get the picture.

So that night I came home thinking about it... But still trying to dismiss it in my head as just a series of bad dreams. I fell asleep without any incidents.

The next night however was a different story. While again thinking about what happened on Sunday, I suddenly felt the bed press down as if someone had suddenly just sat down on my bed, except I was completely alone in my room! A litany of Hail Marys just started in my head because I did not want whatever it was near me, the bed went back to normal and I fell asleep.

Unfortunately, this does not end my story. A year passes by without any incident, and December comes rolling back. Once again it was that day and my door refused to remain shut! My room has carpeting and the door is quirky but it's actually fairly difficult to get open and yet I actually saw... With my own eyes... The knob turn and open... But no one was there! This is actually now fairly common for me. It happens all the time now after that first incident... it's still pretty creepy, but I tend to lock the door now, of course it doesn't help that whatever is doing this now likes to rattle the doorknob to make sure it's locked.

A follow up of the above story is that 2 years later, I ended up talking to my aunt about what had happened to me... And she gives me the most mind-boggling news. My cousin who lives in Nicaragua (the country directly north of Costa Rica) had a similar experience with a shadow thing ON THE SAME NIGHT AND, given the time difference, THE SAME HOUR AS WHEN I WAS ATTACKED! Except that she was nearly choked to death by this thing. I'm talking about she had red hand marks on her neck from this thing.

So now my question remains... And will always remain... Was it all just a dream? Or did it really happen?

That One Night,Canada,Apparitions / Voices / Touches,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Apparitions / Voices / Touches :: That One Night

M y story starts at my old house in newfoundland. I was around six when one night, I heard something. I had hurt my leg on the table the night before so I could only crawl. I told my mom the next day but she didn't believe me. The next night was way more freaky. My brother jesse, who was three years older then me, went in the bathroom to brush his teeth before bed. He said that the shower curtains flew open and there standing in front of him was a tall dark figure! He yelled ""Mom come here quick!"" I heard her foot steps run up the stairs then I heard a scream! I got out of bed and ran into the bathroom, my mom and jesse where looking at something. So I looked up and saw it. It was a large shadowy figure with two red lined for eyes! I swear if you had seen it, you would know how scary it really was!

A few quiet months went by and before long, it was a whole year since the experience. Even though I might have been young I understood how scary it was. All I know is that I never have that kind of experience ever and I mean never again!

My second experience happened when I was older. I was in the girls washroom washing my hands when the light went out. I panicked a little then I ran out the door. When I stepped out of the girls washroom, I noticed all the power was on! So I was kind of freaked out, I asked the janitor if there were any power outages but he said no! Ever since then, I swore that I would never ever go in the girls washroom again!

A Voice from the Grave,"Oregon, United States",Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: A Voice from the Grave

I 'm reluctant to give too many details about these events because there was a crime involved, my father was (briefly) a suspect, and they eventually apprehended a perpetrator who is still alive and in prison. Additionally, as a professional, any misinterpretation of events could, however unlikely, conceivably be used to harm my career.

These events occurred in the early 1980's in the northwest U.S. I was 10 at the time, and lived with my father, mother and sister. As unlikely as it may seem, at age 10, I was already a skeptic, and rather well read (ok, I was a geek). As such, I haven't really been able to explain this away by simply saying I was too young to grasp what was happening.

It started when I awoke one morning to find that my next-door neighbor's home had been roped off with crime scene tape, surrounded by police cars, and overrun with reporters. There had been a murder. As I looked out my upstairs bedroom window, the mother of the victim looked up at me with scathing eyes. The victim was a girl in her late teens/early twenties, whom I will refer to as ""Sara"". I learned that Sara had been murdered some time in the previous 12 hours, shot in the head.

Soon thereafter, my sister's upstairs bedroom became a place to avoid. She would often awaken, screaming in the middle of the night that there was someone in her room. Years later, my mother admitted that even she became reluctant to go into my sister's room to change the sheets or clean. I couldn't walk past the room without the hairs standing up on my head. The cold in the room was very distinct, and omnipresent. You felt watched. The best I can describe it is as a palpable 'cloud of anger' that you could walk through.

I mentioned Sara's mother, because at some point in the investigation, my father was implicated. Sara's mother had reason to suspect this, and as an adult these many years later, I suppose I would have too. The legal aspect of things, however, meant we couldn't divulge the events of our upcoming Ouija board experience to the police or anyone else.

My mother told me that they bought the board out of ignorance, believing its labeling as a ""game"" (obviously a bad idea in retrospect, but it wasn't exactly like you could look up the topic on the internet and get a sense that using the board was not wise). Thus, as our family activity one night not too long after the murder, my mother, father, sister, and I sat down to the Ouija board.

It started off innocently enough, with everyone laughing and accusing everyone else of moving the plastic Ouija piece. We didn't make the connection between the board and the recent murder until after a couple of silly 'yes', 'no' questions (I don't remember what we asked initially). It didn't take long for the endeavor to take on ominous tones. Whatever was moving the piece quickly made it known that 'her' name was ""S-a-r-a"", and that she had been murdered. The piece made rapid, violent movements across the board, occasionally moving so erratically that it would pull away from everyone's hands (though it would stop moving at that point).

I distinctly remember that the chill we'd all felt in my sister's room was now with us around the dining room table. I suppose most parents would have sent the kids out to the room as soon as the implications were apparent, but we were all operating in a sense of shock. Thus, we continued with the questions. I don't remember who asked, but one of us hit on the thought to ask Sara to describe her murderer. She described a man with curly black hair. Next, one of us asked what type of car he drove... and the answer was that it was a gold VW Bug. It was at that point that the gravity of the situation really became apparent to all, and my sister and I were sent upstairs to bed (needless to say, my sister slept with the light on that night).

Soon thereafter (I don't recall exactly how long, but I remember it being a few weeks), my father took me to the barbershop for a haircut. As I sat in the chair waiting to start, I watched the overhead television. My father sat off to my side, waiting for me. It was at that moment that the police mug shot of a man with curly black hair was flashed on screen during a local news broadcast. The man had been arrested on suspicion of a series of murders in the area the announcer explained. Then footage from the outside of the home where Sara was killed came on. That footage was soon followed by the picture of a gold VW Bug in the driveway of a one-story home. Needless to say, with events from the 'Ouija-night' still fresh in my head, I turned to look at my father. He looked at me at that moment. Neither of us said a word to each other, but we both realized this was the man Sara described.

But the eerie occurrences in our home only worsened. My room became equally uncomfortable to be alone in. Objects in my closet would occasionally move on their own accord (clothes would swing or rustle...in a closed room). A friend once stood in my room looking at my fish tank while I got something out of the closet (about 8-10 feet away) when we heard a voice in between us. We turned to each other to ask if the other had heard the voice... neither of us had spoken though.

Luckily, we had to move out of state for my father's work soon thereafter. I have since driven past the old home, but I've never stopped, and certainly never gone back inside. I'm not sure why I feel compelled to tell this story other than to say that in the twenty five years since it happened, it has never been far from my mind. It's hard to explain away the physical description of a murderer and his car as secondary to some sort of 'group-think' or over-active imagination. The events were profound enough that they shaped my willingness to consider the reality of a realm beyond the physical and pay attention to things spiritual (however you might define them). In the end, I suppose I'm mostly just interested in whether anyone else has ever had such a specific, verifiable experience.

My Life Story,Latvia,Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: My Life Story

A s for beginning I'll introduce with myself. I'm Amelia and after a few days I'll turn 16. I want to tell about all those experiences what I have got through all my life. I remember that when I was 6 or so, I saw two women walking near my mom's house (at that time I was living with her). I though that they were one of our neighbors. I remember that both of them looked like from older times, they both looked exactly the same but one of them was shorter. They they both had long white shaded dress with large rose prints on it and big white elegant hat. I looked for some time on them and they both looked on me and they smiled to me and went away. I looked how they were going away and after time they just vanished.

After 2 years I went to live to my grandparents in city, they had apartments there. Mom wanted me to go there because of school, she was living in country and it was really far from school and that school was really bad. Mom wanted me to get good education. I've been living there since I'm 8 and at weekends going to mom. Probably all of the weird things happened after I, for the second time, went to church. I cannot remember exact time when it started. I was 14 and half at that time.

At the beginning I was hearing strange noise under my bed when I was falling to sleep, often I felt that someone was sleeping right next to me. There was a time when, every night, I woke up at 3 am. Once when I was trying to fall asleep, I saw a white orb above the doors. It stayed there all the time until I fell asleep. It didn't feel like it was an evil presence because when I felt sad and was crying, I could sometimes feel cold hands on mine or sometimes I felt that someone was hugging me and I have been kissed too. I almost always felt that someone was near me and I'm being watched but I just couldn't see it. I don't know how but I knew that it was male. I remember that once I saw a vision of a young male (18 or so) who has just committed suicide.

Once I woke up at night because my bed was terribly shaking. It couldn't be earthquake because there is no earthquakes in my country and if we have one, then it's only once in hundred years. For long time there was a dark shadow following me everywhere. If I was out with friends I could see it following behind trees and if I was at my mom's house it would be there too. At my grandparent's apartment, I sometimes saw black cats running around and disappearing under my bed. Once I was going to nearest graveyard to visit my great-grandfather. While I was walking through the graveyard, I again saw the shadow following me, after a few seconds, I looked behind me and saw a male who apparently been following me too. It was around 5 pm and there was no one in graveyard except for us. As I was starting to go faster, he started too. I ran out of the graveyard scared to death and in tears, the male was a few footsteps behind. Fortunately there was a person near the place and he helped me.

Once, when I woke up in the morning, I saw an old male dressed in white, after a few seconds he disappeared as if he would notice that I'm looking on him. I strongly believe that it was my great-grandpa because they both are similar in their look. I have heard only good things about him so as a person I respect him very much.

I remember that once I heard someone talking probably more then one. My grandma was in the bath and grandpa was at home so I thought she came out and was walking around apartment and talking to me. As I went out of my room I didn't saw no one, but I got weird feeling all over me. I felt that I really shouldn't be there so I shut my door. With all these presences came some kind of gift. I often know what people will tell or do. I know who is calling me and because of dreams I get deja vu feeling.

After that night, it was silence from them all year. Until today. Things are being hidden and showed up after a while again. There were other events too but maybe I'll write about them later.

Curiousity Killed the Lightbulb,"New York, United States",Family / Friends Visits,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Family / Friends Visits :: Curiousity Killed the Lightbulb

I was trying to fall asleep in my room, but the TV was too loud. I was way to lazy to get up and get the remote to lower the volume. But I finally got it somehow. When I lowered the volume and turned over on my side, the strangest thing happened. The volume went right back up again. I turned over and turned it down, but before I knew it, the little green bars on the screen went up. I don't believe in ghosts, but this was just starting to get freaky.

I put the lights on to make sure that if there was really any ""ghosts"", they would go away. So then, for the last time, I lowered the volume and waited. Now I think this ghost likes The Fresh Prince of Belair and wanted everyone to hear it. It turned up the volume all the way! It was so curious to know what's going to happen when Uncle Phil finds out that Will burned down the kitchen. I yelled stop! Then one of the light bulbs in my room broke, and the volume went down to the last 3 bars. My mom ran upstairs and asked me why the TV was so loud, I said because I couldn't get what the people were saying.

No one died in my house, but my dad died from cancer and he would always try to watch what I was watching on TV. Also, he liked to only fix light bulbs when they were really broken. So maybe it was him.

Just Plain Different,"Massachusetts, United States",Psychic / Medium,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Psychic / Medium :: Just Plain Different

I grew up in a smaller town in Massachusetts. As a kid, at I night I would always feel as if it there was something else going on that I could not put my finger on. Only after years later talking to my younger sister, she said she felt the exact thing.

I can remember various things happening: for instance many times when I was home alone, and would be in my room reading, and I would hear two or three knocks on my door (it was wooden and distinct sounding.) Another time, and probably the weirdest thing I remember happening at the house was I was sleeping in my room, with my front facing towards the wall, and my back towards my door. I felt a couple taps on my shoulder, and immediately froze. I wasn't sure if I should turn around, or just try to ignore it and fall back asleep. So, I slowly turned around and there was a small thing floating in the air. I kid you not. Now, keep in my mind I was probably 11 or 12 at the time. I've never taken drugs (especially at that age), and in no way delusional. So, for something like that to happen is very odd. The obvious thing would be to dismiss it as a dream, and forget it.

Things like that do happen. The experience not only felt too real, but, I also pinched my self to make sure I was awake. I wish I could provide more insight, or details on the situation, but, I'm having a hard time remembering them. Other things that routinely happened would be cool air blowing by my face when the windows were closed, and shadows. Let me tell you about shadows.

As I got older, I moved from a room upstairs to a room downstairs in our ""basement..."" It was really the downstairs that had a computer area, and laundry room. Even sitting here, to be honest, I still feel silly writing some of this, because when you analyze it logically, it can seem hokey and illogical. I can recount several, and I mean several times, waking up in the middle of the night, or even still being awake and not fallen asleep yet, and I would see shadows in my room. When say I shadow, I'm not talking about a coat hanging on your chair and for a second you mind played a trick on you. I honestly mean, I would turn over and a shadow would be standing directly over my bed. Sometimes it looked like a person, other times it was indistinguishable, but, every time it scared the heck out of me. Thankfully, it was never anything negative that happened, but, was just very frightening to be honest. When you a figure stand over your bed that's a shadow when you're 15, and just stand there, looking at you, I can't think of anything that still scares me more to this day.

The mere truth of the matter is, regardless of what you believe that illusion is a part of our world, and the eyes are very easy to fool, as well as the other senses. It may have been a spiritual entity, it may have been nothing. I think the more important questions to be asked is asked is what do our experiences mean? Are they coincidence? Do they have a higher purpose? I can't say specifically. What I can say, is this. Through my life since than, I have encountered a number of things that have happened, that you ultimately sit back scratching your head and say to yourself, ""I just don't get it. It doesn't make any sense...""

Let me give you another example: A few of my friends and myself were going to performance. A couple of us drove to a friend's before the play. On the way to their house, roughly 1/2 mile or so near, I got this awful headache, and started feeling nauseous. As we went inside the house, it just got worse. I just felt like I shouldn't be there. I took aspirin, hoping it would work. Not to long before we were set to go, I was walking down the hallway and the mirror fell off the wall and cut my hand. A mirror falling off is nothing special in of itself, but, I was a good 6"" away from it, and tried to grab it as it was falling. When we left the house, and went to the car and started driving I immediately started feeling better. That experience alone isn't amazing, by any means, it's just a myriad of things that have happened over the years from minor, to down right mystifying. It still leaves me in a quandry as to how much I should believe, and how much I should think about it. I have lots more to tell, and lots more to share that are simply strange. If you want to know more, just let me know. All the best.

Something Strange About the Rental House,"Washington, United States",Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: Something Strange About the Rental House

B ack in Feb 2003 my house burned down. I was a 7th grader. We were living in a rental house (which was newly built, we were the first people to stay there) while our house was being rebuilt. One night over the summer, I was up late reading. I went to bed at 11, and had trouble sleeping, feeling a bit afraid in the dark. At 1 am, I turned the hall light on and kept my door fully open. 5 minutes later, I heard the screen door downstairs open. I sat there listening, very afraid. I heard footsteps walk through the living room and kitchen, through the hall and stop at the stairs. A moment later they began to ascend. I waited, my heart pounding and my palms sweaty. I stared out my doorway, I had a view of the stairs through my door, but where my bed was I could only see about a 3rd of the staircase. A sliver of black came into view and then moved. I hid under my covers. The footsteps stopped at my door. Suddenly I heard a noise a few feet from my bed, that sounded like a pile of laundry being dropped. Then I felt as if someone was standing near my bed. I held my breath but thought I heared breathing above me. I felt a light pressure on my bed near my leg. I got up some courage, took a breath, and flung my covers off, ready to scream. No one was there. I looked around my whole room, behind my bed, under, in my closet (though I knew no one would be there) and couldn't find anyone.

I ran out of my room to my parents room down the hall, not looking around me, only focusing on their door. I went in and told them what happened. They told me if I was scared, to go sleep in my sisters' room. Shocked they wouldn't get up to check for an intruder, I left to sleep with my 2 sisters. While I was in there, I could hear noises in the hall. I wasn't sure if my parents had gotten up, or if it was something else. The next morning, my mom asked what happened. I explained, and she told me the sliding door had been wide open when she came down that morning.

I had always thought it was a person sneaking into our house. Maybe it was, maybe it wasn't. I never thought it was anything else until awhile later when we weren't in the house anymore. My parents and siblings have told me their own stories.

Apparently one day, my younger brother was home alone when he heard noises in our parents room, like someone going through drawers and pulling things out. He went to check, and saw no one. Everything was as it should be. He called my mom crying, telling her what had happened.

My sisters say one day in their room, they were laughing at a small stuffed lion sitting on their globe lamp. They were making fun of it, when suddenly it went flying off.

My step dad has said he was in his room alone, and he heard a noise like a finger nail tapping on the window. There was no way anyone could have been up there. He also heard loud moaning in the bathroom once (makes sense, right? Haha).

Even my mom, who, while she believes in ghosts, is not one to get worked up over anything, believes something was strange about the rental house. She has said that there were many times she thought Frank, my step dad, had been coming home, but when she checked, there was no one.

I still remember a similar thing happened to my brother and I when we were alone. We thought someone was coming in, but when we checked, no one was there.

My Baby Cousin Sees Things,"Florida, United States",Children Who See Spirits,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Children Who See Spirits :: My Baby Cousin Sees Things

I 'll start off by saying I am 14, and I have a cousin named Kameron who is 3. My aunt cassy moved into a house about three years ago, around the time he was born. We always thought there could have been a presence in the house because kameron would always burst into tears randomly. So now that kameron can talk very clearly, he has been telling us things. He won't sleep in his room because he says he sees a mean daddy and a baby, which freaked us all out! Then toys go off at least 20 times a day. We are very concerned, not for us, but him because we don't want him to be afraid of his own house. He sees things everywhere, like for instance in his mommy's room, he told her a daddy on the ceiling was staring at them laughing and pointing, so my aunt cassy told Kameron to tell him to go away. About 10 minutes later Kameron stared at her blank and said ""no mommy I don't want him to hurt you"". Then he couldn't go to sleep and just cried and cried.

This is starting to scare us and we don't know what to do, because we don't know if he's just thinking he sees stuff, or if these problems need to be fixed. Sadly it has to scare him, because in my opinion, ghosts mean no harm. For all we know, it could be family members and just scare him, because he doesn't know who they are. I need some help, opinions, etc. PLEASE HELP!

L ate at night, I went into my bedroom. I sat down on my water bed, and tried to go to sleep. All of a sudden I felt my heart start to beat really fast for no reason. I sensed a presence in the room, I just couldn't see it, I sat up and looked over to the place where I knew it was. My door was closed but I could feel it in front of my door. I could have pointed to where it was, even though it wasn't visible. I sensed it walking towards me. Then I saw my water bed moving as if it was on my bed. I heard a whisper through my mind saying that it was going to kill me. I rushed out of bed and went to get some water. I felt a little better but almost immediately my heart started racing again. I felt a presence behind me, but when I turned around, I saw nothing. And once again I could point to where it was standing.

It has visited me a couple of times in the past month and I'm really freaked out. I have even heard deep breathing near my ear and my room has turned icy cold for no reason. And one morning I woke up and glass was splattered all across my kitchen floor. And nothing had broken. What do you think I should do?

The Ghost of Mario Montenegro,"Florida, United States",Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: The Ghost of Mario Montenegro

H i, My name is Stephanie and I have a ghost in my house! First a little history. We moved in to this house eight years ago and bought it for a great price. Apparently the owner was very sick and dying of cancer. His wife needed to sell right away as they now lived in New York and were renting the house out.

I was always scared to go up and down the stairs, I would get a creepy feeling. One morning, my daughter said she was having a bad dream, woke up and there was a man in a dark cape and a hat looking at her, she closed her eyes, and when she reopened them, he was standing behind the door, she could only see his hat above the door. This would mean he was eight feet tall! She closed her eyes again and it was walking down the stairs.

Maybe a few weeks after, my other daughter told me of a very similar experience with the same caped man in a hat. I had a dream also, something loud woke me, it sounded like a marble bouncing on the floor and I was paralyzed, in my dream I saw a very tall caped figure in my daughter's room, I tried so hard to move so I could get up and help my daughter but I couldn't.

I called my mom, and told her that she might think this is crazy but I think I have an evil spirit in the house. She, I, and all my aunts started praying and I no longer felt scared. But every time I mention the ghost something happens. I was talking to two of my girlfriends about it on my patio, when my daughter's remote control car went crazy. It didn't think it was even working. We were watching a show about ghosts with my mother in law and told her about our ghost, when the back door swung open and my mother in law's walker moved about three feet on it's own. It was as if to say ""hi I'm here"".

A Ghost's Revenge on Me and my Baby,Australia,Misc,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Misc :: A Ghost's Revenge on Me and my Baby

N ow you guys have me worried! I don't think of myself having psychic abilities but on a few occasions my dreams have come true and for the last few months since moving back into the house where I grew up (my friends have always told me that there was another presence here which I already kind of knew myself), I was never worried about them (spirits) but I've been having these dreams, now these dreams are so real where I could smell, taste, feel EVERYTHING! This was the first one I had bout 6 months ago!

I went to bed as usual and thought I was having difficulty falling asleep so got up to check on my baby, everything was fine so I went outside to have a smoke and I couldn't open the door it was jammed or something, I couldn't even use the key to open it, as I turned around there was a woman standing behind me and her face was messed up really bad almost like she had been beaten to death and she put her hands around my throat, I was trying to fight back, but I couldn't breath and felt like I was going to faint, then I heard a big bang come from my baby's room and she was gone, as I walked into the room it smelt like an electrical fire but there was no smoke, as I went to pick up my baby, the room was flooding with water and there was all electrical cords and all I could think of was that my baby was going to get electrocuted. I screamed for help and my brother came but wouldn't believe me about the woman and that she was trying to kill me and my baby and then she got a hold of him and was trying to kill him so I ran outside for help, but no one would believe me. Finally this big biker looking guy drove past in a f250, at first I thought he wasn't going to stop and then he came to help me, but as we walked inside, I woke up.

I was dripping wet and really scared and couldn't go back to sleep, my brother also woke up and was wondering what I was doing because he heard a lot of noises coming from my room. He went back to bed and I left the hall way light on and closed my door. About 10min after, I heard footsteps and thought my brother woke up again (we have wooden floors so you can hear where people are walking) and it sounded like he went to the kitchen then walked outside my bedroom door and just stood there. I though it was him checking on me but I never heard him walk away and he never answered me when I called his name.

So the next morning I asked him what he was doing last night and why he got out of bed again. But he told me he didn't and he basically fell asleep as soon as his head hit the pillow... So what the heck was walking around my house?

Just a little extra info, when I was pregnant with my first son, I kept having these dreams of a little girl playing with my partner, so I just assumed that I was going to have a girl and got all excited. We were living up north at the time but when we came back to perth, this woman, who my partner had a fling with (before we got together), was claiming that my partner was the father of her child, I never got the chance to meet her at the time.

But one day, when we were shopping, I saw the little girl from my dreams, and just as I said to my partner ""hey that looks exactly like the girl from my dreams"" at the same time, he said ""that's the little girl who is meant to be my daughter"" I couldn't believe it! But then it made sense because I had a son but this dream of the little girl was sooooo real and it wasn't me that was having a little girl, it was my partner and that's why he was playing with her and I wasn't apart of the dream.

My Little Friend,"Michigan, United States",Apparitions / Voices / Touches,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Apparitions / Voices / Touches :: My Little Friend

A few years back when 13, I was walking down the stairs when I spotted someone walking across my porch, I turned and asked my older brother who had been standing in the kitchen, if someone had been outside, perhaps one of my younger cousins but he shook his head stating that my cousins where at their dad. I just wrote it off, thinking that I had just been seeing things, and continued on with my day.

Then about a week later, I was sitting on the couch watching the news when I spotted someone sitting in a chair in the computer room looking at me. It was a little boy about 4 or 5, he had blond hair and was wearing a white shirt and blue pants. I blinked and he was gone.

By then, I was asking anyone who possibly knew something about this young boy. I talked with my step dad who had grown up in the area, had said that his uncle had been struck by lightning and killed outside the house but he had been an older gentleman.

When I was little, strange things had always happened to me, like electronics going off while I slept, so on and so forth. To this date I haven't found out anything about the boy but I figure it's best to let things like this be and not shake up the pieces that I have known over the past few years.

Conversations and Footsteps,"Maine, United States",Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: Conversations and Footsteps

I have been a stay at home mother for over a year now. We bought and moved into our first home, a (nearly new, only one previous owner who owned it for a couple years) mobile home in a very nice community. I've never, ever heard of a mobile home being haunted! Of course, I do know that land can be haunted.

I have done a little bit of research and found that the 25 years this community has been here, the lot that we currently occupy, has been vacant until our home was put on it in 2002. Which is strange because it's a corner lot and could have easily accommodated a home.

We bought this place in March 2006, I had an uneasy feeling from the first night, like someone was watching me from the hallway. Exactly 1 week after moving in, I gave birth to our (first & only) daughter, who is now 15 months old. About a month later was the first time I heard it, which is when my Husband started working overnights.

I was going to sleep, and at 2:30 AM (going back to bed after my daughter's 1am feeding which is when I started trying to get her to sleep in her own room), I heard LOUD evenly-spaced footsteps of what sounded like boots or heavy type shoes going up and down the hallway to my room. I laid there in my room for about ten minutes listening to it, petrified that someone was in my house. My eyes were glued to the doorway, expecting the person to walk right into my room, then it would go back down the hall then come back. A few minutes after the footsteps dissipated (which I chalked up to tree branches hitting the roof) I was startled again when I heard TWO distinct male voices having a conversation in my living room! It was SOOO clear, like if I had been closer I could hear exactly what they were saying. It sounded like and older male (50s+) and a younger male (20s-30s). As soon as I stepped in the hallway the voices stopped as fast as they appeared.

I looked out all the windows to see if maybe someone was taking a late night stroll around the park. There was absolutely NO ONE around. I also have discovered living here now for a year, that when all of the windows and doors are closed, it's impossible to hear someone speaking outside, unless they are right at the window YELLING, and then, you can only hear them within maybe a 10 foot radius. So, I have been able to dismiss that someone(s) were taking a walk.

After that night, I brought my daughter back into my bedroom, and she stayed there until she outgrew the bassinet at two and a half months old, and went back to sleeping in her own bedroom. A couple weeks later, I heard the footsteps again. Then the next night, the male voices were there AGAIN!

In November, I started getting my hair pulled whenever I was in the kitchen. It was like a playful tug, but it was firm enough for me to whip my head around to see who was doing it. There was NEVER anyone behind me, or even close to me, except once. My husband and I were doing dishes together, and I was washing and he was rinsing (our usual pattern) and there was a hard tug on my ponytail, but it wasn't my husband because he had both hands in the sink! And even IF it had been him, my hair would have been wet because his hands were wet, and it wasn't!

I seriously thought that I was going insane, so I went to a doctor who had now put me on severe anti-anxiety meds (I also have PTSD from childhood sexual abuse that has contributed to a history of anxiety). While the meds have helped deal with my PTSD and anxiety attacks, the voices and footsteps disappeared for a little while. That is when I noticed weird orbs and wisps in about a third of the pictures of my daughter. The best one that I had was lost when my computer crashed two weeks ago (I am so mad!) BUT then got worse!

Around February, I was reading in bed one night, when all of a sudden there was a LOUD ""HEY!"" right in my ear, I even felt the heat of the breath on my ear and neck! I was home alone (except for my baby who was sleeping in her crib) I was really freaked out, but somehow I managed to finish the book I was reading and went to bed. At 2:30 AM I woke up to loud footsteps STOMPING up and down the hall, that went on for about 2-3 minutes. I eventually was able to fall asleep.

I have heard the loud ""Hey"" several times since, every time it is followed briefly by the heavy footsteps in the hallway. I haven't had my hair tugged since December though. I have only heard the male voices in the living room a few times since, BUT that is because I am so paranoid that they will wake me up, I have been staying up until 3am to avoid the 2:30AM wake up ""HEY"" & following disturbances.

I know, that IF it is something, it seems to be mostly residual, so I have nothing to be afraid of. I just don't like getting woken up hearing voices in my living room at 2:30 in the morning, it freaks me out and makes me think someone is in the house.

Any suggestions how I can deal with this (without taking a sleeping pill)? I really, really would appreciate any suggestions, or any comments anyone has.

A Few Experiences,"Oklahoma, United States",Misc,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Misc :: A Few Experiences

I n my neighborhood there is a creek that runs through about the middle, so my friend and I always meet there when we want to walk somewhere. One of the times, she was taking longer than usual, so I decided to go down into the creek, which I knew pretty well. I was standing on a rock when I heard my friend start to come to the ledge (they have a small ledge with a handrail built to keep people from falling in) and I heard twigs snapping on the bank about a yard and a half above me. I looked up and saw a dark man-shaped figure walking in the direction of the ledge. I thought it was a resident at first, so I turned to my friend (who was coming nearer to me, now) and told her that we're probably going to get in trouble from that guy, so we better leave. She looked up on the bank and then back at me with a strange expression.

When I looked back up onto the bank, the figure was gone, but I would have heard him leave, and there wouldn't have been time for him to be out of sight that fast, even if he ran.

Once at my school, classes were about to start, so the playground outside was deserted. I looked out onto the playground, and saw a little boy swinging out there --alone. I turned my head, thinking nothing of it at the time. And then I realized a little boy SHOULDN'T be outside when classes are about to start. The only reason I'm listing this is because a friend of mine told me she saw the ghost of a little boy who seemed to look just like the one I saw, so there's a chance it could be a ghost. Not sure.

Another time at school, some friends and I were sharing our experiences with ghosts and things like that. All of a sudden, all of us began to feel very cold, but everyone else in the room was feeling quite warm. Later on, I was told be one of them to go into the largest stall in the bathroom. I did, and it was considerably colder in there, and when I left, I had this terrible feeling of guilt and dread. Everyone that went in there that day experienced the same thing.

Yet another time in the school bathroom, I was in the bathroom alone, and there was no one in the men's bathroom either. After I went into the stall and locked the door, the lock began to rattle. I got scared and decided to go to a different stall. It was also very cold.

Two of my friends and I were in my backyard, home alone. All of a sudden, we heard the porch door slam (I have an enclosed back porch), but there was nothing around to make it do that. There wasn't any wind, that day, and my dog was laying in the sun. One of my friends started saying that she heard one of those dolls that you squeeze and it says ""mama"", except it just kept saying it over and over again. My other friend started hearing it, too.

One of my friends and I were home alone (again) and we had the TV turned off. My friend looked at me and said ""I hear your phone..."" I told her that I didn't hear it ringing, and she said, ""No, not ringing, I hear someone clicking the buttons..."" We, at the time, had terrible Skelerophibia (fear of 'bad guys' or of being kidnapped, raped, or killed) so we started freaking out and ran from the house.

Broken Arrow's North Intermediate High School Theatre Room is haunted by a ghost named Hannah, who is said to have died from a concussion caused by jumping off the stage. This year, my fifth-grade-play was performed there. I was in the chorus and not allowed backstage, but my friend was in the play, so she was. She was in the hallway after changing into her costume when she felt the temperature drop and heard footsteps running towards her. She turned in their direction, and there was no one there, but the footsteps were running in the opposite direction...

Comfortable Stay,Australia,Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: Comfortable Stay

A few weeks ago, on my grandparents 50th wedding anniversary, the whole family on that side of the family went to Martindale Hall in the Clare Valley. It is an 18th century (I think) mansion surrounded by acres of land. As it was an overnight arrangement, my younger sister and I stayed in a room together. All the rooms were made up as they would have originally been (as the house now is a museum during the day and a overnight experience as well) and allocated to the guests of the party. The man who looks after the house plays the butler during a fancy dinner we were entitled to, as part of the stay, and also gives guests a full recount of the history of the place.

While dressing for dinner in the 'Nurse's Room' my sister and I were given, adjacent to the nursery, I couldn't help but feel cold. As it was the middle of autumn (fall) I didn't think much of it. It was then I heard adult laughter through the adjoining door. I had wanted to see a ghost on this trip (being interested and all) however, no recount of the history revealed any of the young masters of the house ever having children, therefore the nursery had never been used. Completely freaked out, I dressed faster and rushed out into the hall, down the stairs to the entrance and turned left into the library, from which I could hear men's voices. I had thought that it was my uncle, dad and older step-cousin in the library, as it had a billiard table and they had been itching to get their hands on it all day. Unfortunately, as the door swung open, all I found was walls of books and an empty room. A cloud of cigar smoke hung over the billiard table though and there was definitely the smell of scotch (the favorite past time of the last owner: cigars and scotch, he died at the age of 36... wonder why) so once again, I was freaked. This time I couldn't move or run away, and I heard the door swing closed behind me.

All of a sudden, a feeling of warmth swept over me, and I felt inside of me that everything was going to be alright, and I wouldn't be hurt. I spent the rest of the night in that library, sitting in the corner with all number of books in my lap. I couldn't help but feel a person sitting beside me, reading along and smoking a cigar. The library was the young owner's favorite room before he died, and books were his joy. I'm sure he was glad to see them inspiring someone once again.

Dreams,"New York, United States",Family / Friends Visits,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Family / Friends Visits :: Dreams

I 'm 13 and I have been encountered with ghosts. Last year, at camp, I was sleeping on the Coach bus (for people who don't know what that is, it's this big comfy bus with a bathroom, DVD player, and tvs!) When you fall asleep on the bus, kids take pictures of you and do stuff to you. I didn't know they would draw on my face. But that didn't happen to me.

Like in my other story, my dad came into my house and wanted to say Hello! And my dad passed away on December 2005. But I seem to be getting messages from him in my dreams. Like for instance, when I was asleep on the bus, my dad kept on saying ""Wake up and move to the left..."" I would say ""Why?"" He would just say ""Just move, they will get you if you don't..."" I did wake up after that and moved. This annoying 14 year old boy just was about to color my face with a blue pen but fell when I moved to the left.

I have been encountered with ghosts besides my dad. Like my friend sent me a chain letter once. It said a ghost story about a girl that died. Then it said, ""If you don't send this to 10 in 30 minutes... She will appear on your ceiling tonight and kill you..."" I didn't send it. But that night, when I fell asleep, this girl showed up and started talking to me. She was saying stuff about her life, why she hasn't been put to rest, and why she died. She asked for advice and I said ""I heard a chain letter about you... Maybe if you got rid of the chain letter... You would be put to rest..."" So the next day, the chain letter was gone.

A Haunting in Mexico,Mexico,Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: A Haunting in Mexico

M y stories begin from the time I was five or six, I believe. My very first encounter with the paranormal began when my mom, dad, brother and me were visiting some family in mexico and we were staying in this house we used to own down there. Now a little background on the town before I begin. Supposedly the entire town was a battle field type of location. Running through the town was a path that all the soldiers used to get to a certain location. Some people hear the sounds of what seems to be horses and men yelling giving orders and what not. My grandmother lives right next door to a house which she says contains all of that paranormal activity including hearing military men on horses and seeing them as well.

Back in that time there was a lot of deaths because of the battles that were carried out. Any person that was killed was buried right there and then wherever they were killed. So it is said that the entire town is like a cemetery because none of the bodies have ever been removed from the ground. Also at that time, there were many people who would burry any type of money or fortune that they may have had, for fear of it being confiscated. So many of the houses in the town have money underneath them.

In the house that we lived, there used to live a lady and her little son. Now we were told from the very beginning by the person who sold them the house that there was money buried there. Whether the money belonged to the lady we weren't really sure. But I know for a fact that this lady that lived there was the spirit I came in contact with as a child. I found all of this history out when I was sixteen so I had no knowledge of anything that may have gone on when I was young.

I remember we had just gotten to the house. It had been a while since we had visited and it had been the second day that we were in mexico. My parents were cleaning up the rooms we were going to be staying in and they decided that we would all stay in their room for the night. The next morning, it must have been about 7 am. I woke up to the sounds of footsteps in the room. Now I was awake but I kept my eyes closed, thinking it was my mom. The weird thing about all of this was that the footsteps seemed to be walking around the bed constantly. I finally sat up and I could still hear those footsteps but there was no body. I knew that the footsteps were circling the bed and I would follow them like I knew someone was there, I knew their exact location. Every now and then the footsteps would stop right on the side of the bed where I was, as if whatever it was was observing me. Then they would continue. I was younger at that time and for some reason I wasn't scared. I didn't feel like it was threatening in any way. But I did tell my dad the next morning. He thought it was someone on the roof trying to get in. I told him I was sure that it was coming from inside the room. I told him that I was following the footsteps but he just brushed it off.

Also when I was sixteen, it must have been three years before our last visit and my aunt was living in that house. She said that when they walked in, on the wall in the dining room, there were in big letters the name ""LETI"". Those letters seemed to have been carved into the wall somehow. She didn't think much of it until she started painting the room. She was painting over it when she said her paint brush flew out of her hand and hit the wall behind her.

It was then that this started to interest me, I asked one of my other aunts if she knew anything about the house and she told me about the lady and her son. And how they have been seen at my house.

I know this is long and I apologize but I felt that this was the beginning of all of the things I have experienced throughout my life.

If you believe me or not, that's really up to you but I ask that you have respect as I will do the same for you.

The Rock House,"Tennessee, United States",Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: The Rock House

M y grand parents moved in the rock house in 1980. Space was very limited for a family with 5 kids and only a 3 bedroom house. At first, when they moved in, everything seemed pretty normal, but after a few months they started hearing noises, like footsteps in the hallway when there would be no one there. My grandmother kept two small dogs in the house and she began to notice that every time something strange would happen, they would hide in the bathroom. One night, my dad and his 3 sisters were coming back home from the movies. When they pulled up to the house, they could see through the window what appeared to be my grandpa going into the bathroom. My dad waited outside of the bathroom for a few minutes, waiting for my grandpa to come out. After waiting for a while, he got worried and opened the door and didn't see anyone.

A few months later, another strange thing occurred. My aunt was sleep walking, which she did a lot, often she would fall and accidentally hurt herself. My dad hadn't fallen asleep and heard her moving around downstairs. So he went down stairs and tried to find her. When he did, she was walking towards the bathroom and there was a man standing in front of her, only a few feet away. He was wearing overalls and and a long white beard that came a few inches below his chin. My aunt just kept walking and walked completely through him! After that he disappeared.

When my grandparents moved out 5 years later, he was still making noises and appearing often. Over the years, only a few people have lived in that house, most only stay for a few years and leave it empty for a little while.

Only I Can See Him,"Oregon, United States",Family / Friends Visits,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Family / Friends Visits :: Only I Can See Him

M y step dad died in 2002 (I don't remember the dates but I do remember it was in 2002), after he died I was really sad and I started sleeping on the couch in our living room and at night, I would watch tv. We had two computers on the other side of the living room. One was his and a week after his death, when I was trying to sleep, I could hear a cough (he had heart problems and diabetes) and the clicking of a keyboard and when I looked over at the computer I saw like a bluish outline of him. Other than that, I could hear sounds of bags (like chip bags) rustling and when I checked, no one was there, but I could still hear it. My old cat Tornado, who disappeared, really liked my step dad and after he died (my step dad died in his and my mom's bedroom) Tornado would NEVER go in that room again and when I went in there for about a month, it was always really cold. What was strange was I could hear it as if he were still alive, but I could still see him as clear as day (I knew I was awake because I spilled some milk on my shirt the first night and it was there in the morning). I asked everyone but no one else could see him or hear him.

My Grandfather's Death,"Delaware, United States",Family / Friends Visits,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Family / Friends Visits :: My Grandfather's Death

I hope ya'll can bear with me as he just passed 3 months ago. My grandfather has been sick for the past 3 years and in January 2007, he took a turn for the worse. Toward the middle of March, I had taken time off from work to be with my grandfather. Every night I went to my fiancee's house to stay.

March 19 started out the usual day. My fiancee and I went to my grandmother's house to spend some time with my grandfather. We were there until about 11:30 that night. We went back to her house where I was ready for bed. Just as I laid down, about 12:30, I received a phone call from my mom on my cell phone. She had told me that my grandfather had passed away at 12:17 am on March 20. I started to cry. I called to my fiancee, who had just taken a shower, and as I sat on the couch, she came out and I just looked at her. Then she said ""He passed didn't he..."" All I did was shake my head yes. She told her mom that we were going back. Even as I sit here, typing this, I am starting to cry. We got there and everyone was around him. I had decided to lay on the floor (everyone else was sitting down or out in the kitchen talking).

Next thing I knew, I felt something kick me in the leg. I looked and asked everyone if they had kicked me. Of course they all said no. I think my grandfather wanted to tell me goodbye.

Ouija Board,"Kentucky, United States",Ouija Board / Seances,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Ouija Board / Seances :: Ouija Board

I 'm new to this so hopefully no one will say that I'm an idiot for what I am about to tell you. I'm not a Wicca or spiritualist, I am catholic and I was raised in a home that was 'supernaturally strict'. My parents do not believe in ghosts or anything of the supernatural variety and they forced those ideas upon my siblings and me since an early age. For example, my younger brother was not allowed to play with his imaginary friend because my father would tell him ""...If I can't see him, he's not real!"" Therefore, my brother had to stop playing with it (his friend was a talking duck-fish). And so, because of how my family raised us, when I was a teenager I went through a sort of rebellion and I became fascinated with the occult and other things, not at any point did I worship any entity or idol I simply read books and went to web sites.

Now on to the story, when I was in my rebellious stage I went behind my parents back and purchased a Ouija board along with other various item that I believed to be paranormal. At one point during high school, I was invited to a party for my friend that practiced witchcraft. However, my friend had understanding parents who let her make her own decision so they permitted me to bring over my Ouija board. My friend had destroyed her own board due to horrible occurrences, and just to point this out, at that time I had no idea of her previous experience with her board (neither were her parents.)

Somewhere around 1 and 2 a.m., my friend had gathered up a group of five of her friends that were also part of her coven, and myself. She instructed the six of us to form a circle around the board and she continued on to pour a ring of salt around us and lit a number of candles. She and her coven then chanted a verse about five times. They had told me earlier that they would perform a 'protection circle' before they even touched the board, although they planned on asking simple questions, they told me beforehand that it would be very serious and that I should stay calm at all times and not to break the circle. Along with this information, the girls informed me at any time if I wanted to stop and four or more of us agreed we would, and as to not disturb the spirit we would say a safe word ""Lucy"" so that it would appear that we were trying to get another girl's opinion.

As they finished the chant, my friend handed me a pen and a notebook where I would write down the reply from the board. I asked not to be a part of it; I never once used the board through out the three years that I had it, after $14.99 plus shipping, go figure.

My friend started out with very broad questions, ""Is there anyone with good intentions that would like to speak with us?"", ""Is there a person in the area that would like to speak, we would like to talk to you."" This went on for about eight minuets and by then I was thoroughly bored, however my friend waited patiently and said after another minute had passed ""If there is no one at this time that would like to speak with us, we are going to say goodnight.""

After about a ten-second wait, the girl started to push the pointer to goodbye when they moved it to the middle again. At this point I thought they were just trying to play around, to get each other to laugh after the let down, until my friend said to write down what the board was saying.

It started of very simply, the board said hello and the girls greeted it and asked if it would like to talk to them tonight. The board pointed to yes. Now I must tell you, I remember just about everything that happened that night down to every word spelled for two reasons. Number one, I was writing everything down and number two, I cannot write things down quickly even under pressure and the board was spelling at a slower rate than I was.

""What would you like us to call you? Or do you have a name we can call you by?""

At this point two girls wanted to stop, but my friend said no, which was in code ""Not right now.""

At this point the pointer moved quicker to the letters N O, and again my friend asked what he meant by no.

At this time, three girls (the two from before and another) said Lucy very loudly and again my friend said not right now. Unfortunately, I wanted to stop also, but I also wanted to see what would happen, it was like watching a horror movie for me, I wanted to see the end but I didn't want to be scared so I kept quiet.

Again, this made me a little bit freaked out; I still get that feeling while writing this. However, the girls did not want to stop, they wanted to continue so we plundered on ahead.

""This is me, Richard left. You are mean, he was very sad, so you must be mean.""

""We're very sorry about Richard but we won't talk to you until you tell us who you are.""

At the time, I was being torn between yelling out Lucy at the top of my lungs or crying. I know that crying may seem like a strange reaction for that sentence but I can remember wanting to cry so much at that time. It felt like I just saw the ending scene from The Notebook all over again. Nevertheless, the girls carried on asking for a name, and after three tries, they received one.

Apparently, that was a big no-no, every girl turned and glared at me for my intrusion. Apparently, it was dangerous for someone not touching the pointer to talk or to mention things that could hurt me later on. The pointer moved so the girls had to turn around so they could spell it out again.

We waited about three minuets for a reply, and when the pointer moved again we thought we were still talking to Nicole. We weren't.

""What..."" My friend didn't get to finish the question before the pointer moved.

This word was repeated about nine times before I said Lucy, and five other girls said it. My friend did not say the word but as per our agreement, she said goodbye forcefully. Moreover, when the girls decided to push the pointer to goodbye they met a little bit of resistance and we all said goodbye and just about slammed the board into the box.

My friend quickly took the box and put it back into the center of the circle before the girls left the circle or would allow me to, they said a quick thanks for the protection provided and they rose as a group and we left the circle together. We all quickly ran upstairs to my friend's room and we noticed that the entire conversation took about two hours because it was around 5:20 a.m. Because it was a sleep over, we decided to take buddies into the bathroom and we would get ready for bed and stay in groups.

My friend was upset because she was forced to stop the conversation early and so when I was with her and another girl (one from the coven I had just met, she was a senior), she asked to keep the board until the coven came back later to try again. I didn't hesitate in saying yes, while the girl looked like she was about to object, until she was silenced by my friend's father asking if we knew what time it was and if we had to wake up in an hour to get to work. So we finished changing and 'primping' for bed before we returned to the bedroom to find the other four upset about something.

It appeared to them as if one girl felt a tugging on her hair, and a cold pressure on her foot. She considered herself sensitive so the coven took it very seriously. I however being the skeptic I was (I know I was in rebellion, and even after that session I still thought that maybe she was a bit spooked) decided that I would wait for them to calm down before I asked if maybe she just caught her hair on something, or maybe even if her foot fell asleep. This was, as I found out later, rude because I had somehow called her a liar. So for the rest of the night they discussed what the unanswered questions could be, they carried on talking for quite some time, and no sleep was had at the sleep over

As you may have guessed, that was the last time I saw my board, my friend kept it and it seems that she used it on her own to try and contact Nicole and Richard again, to no avail. In addition, with the help of her coven, they destroyed the board, because of ""negative energies"" that clung to the board.

Weird Things,"California, United States",Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: Weird Things

I t started when I moved in to my new house. We thought it was going to be great. The stuff that happen is so weird. First we bought a machete and stuck it to a tree. The next day when I wake up the machete is on the ground! I know that it was tight cause I tried to take it off but it wouldn't budge. I asked the neighbors if anyone died in my house and they said yes. They said that a guy got a machete and killed himself. I also have a trampoline and I use it a lot. One night I was sleeping and something woke me up. The sound of jumping on the trampoline woke me up! I looked to see who was there, but no one! The neighbors also said that a old lady died there too. One night I was in my moms room right. I was seeing a ghost show. Then I see something on the top of my bed! It was white and after a few seconds it faded away.

More and more stuff keep on happening in my house. I keep on telling my mom the things that happen but she says that she doesn't believe me or that I am imagining things. I keep on saying that things are true but she keeps on telling me the same thing.

Until I find more things to tell you I'm going to be outside looking for them. So if you have anything to tell, comment me or go to my email and send me a message.

My Loving Mom,Canada,Family / Friends Visits,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Family / Friends Visits :: My Loving Mom

M y Mom was a generous, gentle, kind hearted person. She'd help out any way she could. I hate to tell you that when I was a teenager I was pretty rude to her. You know, everyone around the age of 15 or so knows everything there is to know about everything. My Mom always let things slide to a reasonable level before she'd let me know what a jerk I was acting. I think she understood that I was just being a teenager.

One day I realized just how lucky I was to have such a great mother and friend and I started to let her know that I felt that way. That was the first time I had ever said 'I love you' to Mom (we weren't a really huggy-kissy family, we loved each other, we knew it and that was fine). I started taking Mom out for coffee and shopping, talking with her more and just hanging out. Why the big change? I don't know, it just felt like it was time.

Shortly after, she was diagnosed with cancer. Hmmm. Lucky for us she beat it that time but five years later she developed cancer and it quickly spread and took her away from us. My Dad and I were heart broken. She'd been here for my wedding which made her very happy but when I was pregnant for the first time, I felt so sad that she wouldn't see her first grandchild and I thought of her so often.

When my son was born, we forgot to take a camera to the hospital for his first pictures, we didn't even think about it until the lady in the next bed's hubby started taking photos. I guess she overheard us and very kindly lent us her instant polaroid to take some pictures. The first one was a very tired me holding a wrinkly little bundle, sort of down on my lap. I took one of my hubby holding baby and then another of me with baby. We gave the camera back and looked at the now fully developed pictures.

The first one of me with our little one was so amazing! My image was clear as a bell but my baby had a big orb around his whole body. The other pictures taken with the camera were just fine. My Mom saw her first grandson after all!

When my Dad was near the end and in the hospital (we both knew he wouldn't be going home) he was pretty weak and only semi-conscious most of the time. When he was awake and aware, he was totally lucid. The Dad I knew and loved. On his birthday he told me that he had seen my Mom at his window the night before and he was ready to go with her. I didn't want to hear it but I believed him and knew it really was almost his time.

The next day was my birthday and he wished me happy birthday and we chatted for a time. He finally got tired and dozed off. He never woke up again. Since then I haven't had any experiences involving either of my parents. I think they're too busy with each other now that they are back together.

Now I Believe in Ghosts,"Ohio, United States",Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: Now I Believe in Ghosts

I live in Boardman, Ohio, and there are three stories that I have since the Summer of 2000 that I would like to explain. Don't doubt my memory either- I remember everything perfectly, and I am 100% sure that this is accurate. I want to post it to see if anyone else had anything similar happen. I know it's a lot, but just read one of the three bullets if you don't want to read a lot.

This is the first incident that made me actually consider the possibility that what people call ""ghosts"" actually exist. I was in my basement around 9:00 PM playing a keyboard facing the wall. I saw someone out of my peripheral vision walking toward me. I could see all the features of a human: a head, arms and legs moving bilaterally, and even the walking motion was slightly exaggerated. It walked right up and stood next to me as if it was trying to get my attention nonverbally. When I looked, nothing was there... I was a little disturbed but eventually shrugged it off. Now, later that SAME night (around 1:00 AM), I was sitting on the computer in the dining room for quite some time. Everyone was asleep and I had been sitting still for about an hour and a half. I got up to use the restroom. When I returned, I passed the desk I was sitting at and headed for the kitchen. This is when I realized that the fan was moving very slowly as if someone just tapped it a second ago. It was moving the wrong way. Things became ""creepy"" at this point... I then heard an overabundance (more than usual) of little noises all over the house that night- like the house settling.

This began in the earlier part of 2002 (let's say March). My parents and I were the only ones living in my house at the time. While in bed at night, I would hear a noise every once in a while that sounded as if someone was standing across my room digging their foot into my carpet. It was a scrapping or rubbing noise. Just rub your foot back and forth into your own carpet to see what I mean. This scrapping sound varied in duration and forcefulness. Sometimes it was very loud and fast, but sometimes it was more subtle and slow. This would happen almost every night for about two months. During these two months, a few other things happened that were even stranger. One night, I heard something slide across my floor very quickly (making the same carpet-friction sound) and ran into my bed. My bed shook. Another night, I heard someone dance or hop down the hallway hitting a ""squeaky"" spot in the floor several times. I'm sure it wasn't another member of the family just getting up- I would have heard my parents' door open- it's very loud. Another night, I was laying there listening to the usual feet-scraping, when something hit my dresser VERY hard. Imagine kicking your dresser as hard as you can with shoes on. I even heard the dresser's knobs dingle. Remember, this was right next to me- five feet away. I was very scared and didn't move. Then, about ten minutes later, someone knocked on my window twice. I still hear the carpet friction once in a while anywhere in the house to this day.

This happened in 2003. I was sitting in my basement on the computer late at night. Everyone was asleep. I then heard a very loud bang on the floor upstairs that came from the dining room. I immediately went upstairs to the location and found nothing out of the ordinary. It seemed to me as if someone had picked up the desk chair in that room and dropped it from about a two-foot height- which is LOUD. It was the only object in the room that could have made this noise.

These three incidents are the main stories I have. There are SEVERAL smaller things that happened to me. Things had fallen off the shelves many times over the years. The toilet sometimes flushed on its own. Other people who visited my house (friends, cousins, etc) reported seeing black balls floating around my basement. A girl I was watching TV with one night told me that while I was in the bathroom, someone walked down the steps who she thought was me, but nobody was there. Another person once saw a human shape walk past him in the mirror in the basement. When our dog died, each one of us (my parents and I) heard the same bark (just once) come from INSIDE the house the very next day.

If you are reading this and are thinking ""wow, that happened to me,"" then please let me know via comments. I would like to know if someone else had any of this before.

A Nasty Ghost,Australia,Psychic / Medium,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Psychic / Medium :: A Nasty Ghost

I thought I would give a follow up to my story A Life of Haunted Houses once again it will probably seem like a bunch of words thrown in a sentence, so sorry! For those who haven't read it, i'll give you a small summary... I have been able too see/hear ghosts, every house I have moved to, I've seen a ghost or two. More recently we moved house and things have gotten from bad to worse.

I'm constantly feeling like I'm watched, the only sacred place is the bathroom (thank god!). I've lived in this house for about 4-5 months now and things just don't stop happening. I'll turn a cold tap on, leave it for a second and the hot tap will be on instead or I put a tap on and it will just stop running.

I'll give you a small run down of our house, when you first walk in, on your right, there's 2 glass doors that lead to the lounge room and further down is the kitchen, on the left there is the computer room and dad's room, if you walk through the kitchen there is just a spare room that can also lead to the lounge and my room.

My room is always icy cold, no matter if I put a heater on in there or not, it's always cold. One night I was on my way to bed when I saw a dark figure standing in the spare room near my bedroom door, it was pretty dark, but I could still make out the shape of it and I instantly knew this ghost was bad news, I'd seen it standing over me at my old house and it was back again. I was pretty much glued to the spot, when it started moving closer, I still couldn't move, I was scared s***less, anyway, it got to a point where I was face to face with it and all I could smell was death and I could hear it, it was breathing and muttering something, I couldn't understand, at that point I just ran and woke dad up.

Everything stopped until a few weeks ago, I injured myself and have been off work so I have been home for about 3 weeks. At night, as I'm going to sleep, I hear these noises, it sounds like there is a dinner party going on far away and you can here heaps of people talking, but when I get up to see if the radio or tv is on, there is nothing, so I go to bed and it happens again.

My dog goes absolutely insane at my bedroom door at random times for no reason. Or he will run around woofing, which is unusual cause he's usually a quiet dog. On my first night off, dad was out so it was just me and damo (my dog). I was in the computer room and got up to get a drink when I heard a door open, I didn't really think much of it and just said brb to everyone and went to leave the room. when I found I couldn't get the door open, I thought it was just the door because its an extremely old house, but I kept puttling and pulling and just couldn't open the door.

The room went icy cold and I heard a door slam outside the room and I started to panic and went to go through the windows, unfortunately they hadn't been opened before because it's winter here, so I tried the door again and I heard a faint voice say 'welcome home' and the blinds start moving. I hid under the table and shut my eyes until it stopped. I didn't bother telling dad because he would have thought I was being childish.

That morning I woke up to dad screaming at me, all his strings on his guitar had been cut and his room was a mess, I hadn't done it and damo didn't because how does a little staffy cut guitar strings? I had to take the blame because every other excuse wouldn't really work.

The next thursday my nan came to pick me up to get my glasses, she came in to sit down and about 5 seconds later walked straight out, dragging me along with her and said ""are you aware there is a man in the house with bad intentions, also there was a girl with him"" I knew nan was telling the truth because she can see stuff better than me.

Since then, I've slept with my light on until two nights ago when things got out of control. I got told to turn my light out because it was costing money, so I did. About 10 minutes of lying there, my bed started shaking, like there was an earthquake, it went for about 15 seconds and I got ripped off the bed and slammed into the wall, my bed was still shaking and I couldn't breath, I'm not sure if I was winded or it was on purpose, but the ghost was there again, with the little girl, who was crying and looking rather apologetically at me, the man knelt down next to me and whispered 'welcome's over' or something along those lines and disappeared, but the girl stayed, I know she isn't bad, I've seen her my entire life, and I went back to bed scared out of my brain but knowing I was ok cause she was watching.

I know it sounds REALLY unbelievable, but it's true and it's becoming more dangerous, the more I see and the better I see. They say the older you get the less you see, but it seems to be opposite for me, I even see stuff at friends houses!

Please help! I'm not religious and I can't really get people to 'banish' the ghosts, there has to be something I can do?

Mommy Always Told Me not to Talk to Strangers,Canada,A Haunted Life,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: A Haunted Life :: Mommy Always Told Me not to Talk to Strangers

M y mother always asked me not to play with Ouija Boards. I am going to mention a couple of different experiences with Ouija Boards throughout my lifetime, as there are really only four that really stand out in my memory. The last two being the most terrifying/exciting.

1. I was probably about 6 or 7, my best friend (at the time) and I were hanging out with her older sister and her buddy. They had the Ouija Board out, I distinctly remember something strange happening and the older sister freaking out a bit. She broke the board in half, and asked the two of us to take it to the trash. So, we did. The next morning, us two younger ones ran to the closet to grab the game of Trouble (we loved this game) and to our surprise there was another Ouija Board sitting right on top of our board game. I figured maybe they just had two boards, but my friend was startled. She called over her sister. Her sister grabbed the box, tore it open - and low and behold the Ouija Board (the exact same one, it had her name in big red letters on the back and everything) was in perfect condition. Not snapped in half, nothing. No sign of any damage that had occurred to it the night before. Her sister started crying, and we never spoke of the incident again until recently when we just got back in touch. She remembers it just as well as I do.

2. I was about 13 or 14, I was at my girlfriend's house and hadn't touched a Ouija board since the very first incident (as having something completely put itself back together, or whatever it was that happened, wasn't exactly something that comforted me). I stumbled upon her Ouija Board while I was rummaging through her closet for something she asked me to find and got pretty excited about it. I asked her if she wanted to try it. She seemed pretty bored by it, she told me she wasn't interested as the thing never works. I asked her if it would work if I used it on my own. She told me that you need more than one person to operate it, and off she went into her sister's room onto the computer to chat with some boy she liked. She was just in the other room, and I told her I was going to try it on my own - thinking I'd end up staring at a motionless board and become disinterested within minutes. I was sitting on her bed, this was the second time I had ever been over to her home - so I didn't know much about her or much about her place. The cursor started to move, and it startled me. I figured it was just my fingers shaking until the cursor started to move rapidly without my pushing it along (other than touching it with the tip of my finger) and proceeded to spell out ""H-e-l-l-o"".

Me: ""Uh, Lana? Are you sure this thing doesn't work by yourself?""

She sat there and continued to type and said ""Yeah I'm pretty sure, why?""

Me: ""Uh, I'll tell you in a second..."" So I started to whisper my questions. I asked for the name - and at this point I can't remember the name, but it was a man's name - and he gave me his full name. I wrote it down. I asked him if he was related to anyone in the house, and he said Yes. I asked who, and all I got was this response:

""A-D-P-L-J-P"" I was confused. Those are a lot of initials for one name. So, I got up and wandered over to Lana and asked her if anyone in her family had those initials. She looked at me, laughed and said No - so I started on my way back to her room and then she asked me to wait.

Her sister: (A)my (D)awn (P)rocter, and herself: (L)ana (J)olene (P)rocter

I was totally freaked and excited as I did not know Lana's middle name, nor did I even know her sister's full name - I didn't even know her sister's first name at this point. I asked her if she knew of the name that I had written down and she said no, but the last name rung a bell. She came back into her room and grabbed a key from a drawer and opened the chest that she used as her night stand (something I also had no idea about or that there was anything in it). She pulled out a family album of her mother's that she had given to her years ago. And right smack in the first page was his name, it was her mother's Grandfather.

The Ouija board stopped working after that. I couldn't get over it. I thought that was amazing. But it totally freaked me out and I didn't touch one again until a few years later.

3. My mother always told me not to play with Ouija Boards as she had a bad experience playing ""Ghost in a glass"" where the Glass had actually exploded once her and her girlfriends touched it - and she never tried anything like that afterwards. She hated the idea of it, it scared her. My mother passed away when I was 18 years old (I'm 22 now), and a few weeks later I bought a board. She had asked me not to try and contact her, just in case. But I missed her so much, I went into her bedroom and laid on the carpet next to the bed where she passed away and begged for her to respond to me on this stupid thing. It took my crying and wailing for almost an hour, my friend Adam found me on the floor mumbling to myself and he tried to pray me away from it - but the cursor moved. By itself.

I was just watching it. He missed it, but I begged him to stay with me and just help - even watch. It may not have been her, but I desperately wanted to believe it was - Adam put his fingers on the cursor - and this is something he never would have known (I wasn't touching it), the cursor started moving in a certain pattern of circles and drawings that my mother used to draw on my back the *exact* same way every night for years and years (and still did once in a while to wake me up in the mornings) all over the board. I burst into tears I was so happy, I said thank you - and then it stopped abruptly but I didn't care. And the presence we both felt was gone. The room was incredibly hot when he walked in, he told me. And it stayed warm for about 3 days, my father complained about how warm it was in there - the rest of the house was air conditioned and fine, but his bedroom was just overly heated, he stayed on the couch for a few nights. It was unreal.

I apologized numerous times as I knew she was angry. But she did it. She let me know she was there, and I couldn't have asked for anything more wonderful. But this sparked something in me that I don't necessarily regret, but lead to my next experience which was thrilling, scary, and exciting all at the same time. And I should never have done it, and I already know my mother's put a stop to my trying.

4. I was 19, my girlfriend had just moved in to an apartment on her own in a historical building downtown Calgary. We had another friend we hung out with a lot, his name was Bob. I mentioned one evening that I was interested in ghosts and what not, and we all started to tell one another of our strange experiences. We decided to go get Bob's Ouija Board - in which he refused to use. He hated the thing due to a bad experience they all had when he used it last, which had been a few years prior. But he didn't mind watching.

Kyla and I jumped on this thing right away, and we started getting mixed up messages, garbled mumbo jumbo - pretty much a load of crap up until finally someone started to make sense. This person did not like us at first, it kept saying ""M-A-M-A"" as soon as it started to get frustrated with us and it seemed to move on as someone else stepped in and started talking to us. I can't necessarily remember all of the details of the conversation, but this spirit stuck with us for almost 2 weeks. It got to the point where Kyla (my girlfriend whom was living in the apartment) was so scared she was sleeping with a knife under her pillow, she started to lose sleep as she would start to see lights above one tile in the kitchen - tiny dim flashes.

She was terrified, so one day Bob and I (not entirely believing all of it - just figured she was making a big deal) went over there to comfort her and help her believe we were coming to rid of this spirit. I grabbed a few of my mother's things, my favorite things, I wanted to create a circle of love - something that would ward off anything bad. The spirit then began to tell us just simply that he was lonely, he really liked Kyla and he just wanted her to pay attention to him. She was terrified by this. But I could see why, she was very susceptible to him, he could connect with her almost immediately without using a board. It was scaring her so much, I had to figure out a way to comfort her so that this spirit would stop insisting so much. He just wanted her to like him, he did not want her to be scared of him.

We never got a real name out of this guy, so we started to call him something else - and he didn't mind. Kind of like a nickname, but at one point he even told us that he could not remember his name. I decided to spend the night with my girlfriend at this point, and Bob went home. This is when things started to get interesting. It started to become quite fun, this spirit just wanted a friend, and he was very excited and playful. We ended up trusting him a little too much, and I was incredibly weary, but Kyla started to get so excited all she wanted to do all of the time was talk to him. She was no longer scared, so I went with it. It got to the point where her and I were holding the very very tips of our fingers on the cursor and this thing would zip all the way around the room, sometimes keep going by itself for a few seconds (quick jumps and turns, without us even touching it) when we couldn't keep up. He would constantly circle on top of the tile where Kyla would see the lights. We were never sure why, but he considered it his. And this tile was exceptionally warm compared to the rest - all of the time during this whole experience.

The last night we had contact with this spirit was exceptional and scary. Here is how it went:

We had Bob back over, along with one of his buddies who was interested in what was going on and had never experienced anything like it. We figured it would be okay, and it was. The spirit ended up enjoying becoming a source of entertainment. I asked him if he could show us a trick. He said yes, watch. We watched. We put our hands on top of the cursor and before any of us could say anything, the cursor forcefully FLEW into the CD player sitting next to us on the floor and forced itself upright - it basically smacked the damn thing. This was confusing.

We put the cursor back on the board, and then all of a sudden I could hear a wurring noise. I open the CD player and the disk inside is spinning and spinning incredibly fast... This CD player is UNPLUGGED. We freaked out a little bit and had our laugh and were quite excited, as was the spirit as he expressed his enjoyment quite thoroughly. Then, I asked if we could hear his voice. He said, yes - laugh. So, we kind of sat there in silence for a few minutes. Nothing. Hands go back on cursor and it moves immediately again to ""you need to laugh"". I explain that we all can't just laugh on command, and he would have to tell us a joke. And he did, he had us roaring - and then all of a sudden off in the corner where Kyla's bed was located we hear this bellow of male laughter last about 3 seconds until we all completely stopped - looked at one another, and ran out of the apartment - down the stairs, and basically just took off.

It terrified us all. I honestly did not think that was possible. We all went for coffee, Bob & his buddy refused to come back with us as they were quite freaked out and giddy over the experience and that was good enough.

On our way back to the apartment I started to feel terrible, as did Kyla - we panicked and literally RAN away. This poor spirit is doing nothing but trying to entertain us and enjoy himself - and wow, I honestly felt incredibly upset about us just running away from him like that. We didn't want to go back to it right away but we could definitely feel his presence, I let him know we'd get around to it in a bit - us girls just want to talk for a while.

We were sitting together on the floor cross legged both with a glass of beer in our hands. Kyla's finger was somewhat inside her glass while she was talking to me and I noticed her finger tapping the side of the glass softly but quickly, but we weren't listening to any music - so I asked her if she was nervous. She looked down at her finger and quite abruptly stated that she was NOT doing that with her finger, and started to panic.

Not too long after us noticing that - her elbow started to lift and she stated to me again that she was not the one doing it. I was getting angry with her, I told her this was a cruel joke and that it was completely impossible for something like this to happen. She started to cry, the tears and the fear in her eyes were what convinced me - I screamed STOP! And it stopped. I grabbed the Ouija Board and proceeded to tell this spirit that using our bodies involuntarily was not acceptable - and maybe we learned to trust him too much. I'm not sure what gave him this ability, but it was terrifying. I told him if he did it again I would cut off the conversation and we would never speak with him again. You could feel the room go solemn, and sad.

We sat down and started talking to him, he apologized, he felt terrible. He just didn't know why we ran away, he didn't mean to scare us, and proceeded to tell us that in not so many words. We came to common ground and started talking about random things. He started to joke with us again and we had a bit of fun for an hour until he said: ""your fading"".

Kyla and I looked at one another and just kept our fingers on the cursor.

Kyla and I both sitting across from one another waited a little bit, something intense was in the air but the board was no longer working. We put both of our hands in our laps, and I said ""maybe he passed over?"" All of a sudden, I could feel tingling in my feet, and it started to move up my legs - I thought maybe my legs were falling asleep. I told Kyla, and looked up at her, and her eyes were wide and she said ""oh my god, it's happening to both of us"".

This tingling sensation ran all the way up through our bodies, both of our arms flew up into the air without us moving them ourselves, and a tear rolled down each of our cheeks (a tear in which we did not cry).

To this day, we are still not too sure what to think of this experience. And the fact that someone else experienced it with me and can explain the story exactly the same with details is incredibly strange. Bob & his buddy still talk about the experience they had with us and the ghost earlier that evening.

After that the presence was entirely gone. The Ouija Board no longer works, and I refuse to touch them. I've been in the same room as people when they're playing the Ouija Board and they complain about it not working and constantly saying ""M-A-M-A"". Remember this encounter earlier. I don't even have to be in the same room, I can be next door. I've had complaints from our next door neighbors at one point explaining this M-A-M-A phenomenon (and these people didn't even know my story). So something's out there preventing spirits from getting close to me, I think.

What do you think? What is your take on all of this? It was an incredible experience, but I think those last two are good enough for me to last a lifetime.

The Lady in the Hallway,"Texas, United States",Psychic / Medium,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Psychic / Medium :: The Lady in the Hallway

H ey yall, I'm 15 from Houston, Texas and I'm kind of freaked out here. This is all very new to me, I have never talked about this with anyone. My Story began when I was about 6 years old, I had a a really scary dream. My dream began with this tall teenage hispanic guy with black hair like me. The young guy was in a house walking down a hallway when out of nowhere, at the end of the hallway, there was a malicious looking women staring straight at him, as soon as he got a glimpse of her, he ran away, but when he started running off, he fall hard towards the ground and was holding his ankle and looked like he was in pain. I would have that dream at least once every month until I was 12.

This is the scary part, just last year, me and my family moved to a new house, it was a nice house but I had a really bad feeling about that house, everything was quiet, for a day or two I started having weird cold chills going up my spine, when I would move to a certain part of the house, it would get cold all of a sudden and I felt like I was being watched most of the time.

One time after school, I was very tired and headed for bed,  I was making my way down the hall when I saw a woman, she gave a really evil presence, so I ran straight out of the house and waited outside until my old man got home.

I didn't tell him about my experience but the next day, I remember, me and one of my home boys came over to my house right after school to play soccer. While we were playing soccer, he asked me ""hey who's that lady watching us from the window?"" as I turned around, I saw the same women from the hallway staring at us from a window, as soon as I saw her, next thing I now I fell straight to the ground. I had twisted my ankle. Then I remembered the dream I had when I was little.

It starts out with a man getting in a car and driving around what appears to be the astro stadium in houston (that's where I live), he drives in the parking lot of the stadium to park his car, when he gets out, a car parks right in front of his, then a dark figure calls out ""STOP!"", as soon as the man turns around he gets shot right in the chest as he is trying to keep himself up, the dark figure gets into the car and in the passenger seat is the same women that I saw in the hallway.

Now I'm pretty sure that the man in the dream is me because we look so much alike. What do you guys think, do yall think this is my fate?

I've had so many dreams like this, for example I had a dream of a car wreck in front of my house with a women screaming ""david oh my god, david!"". And sure enough it happened, a guy named davi green collided his car with big moving truck and he had a broken neck, broken ribs, and a broken collar bone. I know david myself, he lived 4 houses down. But I didn't know him until after I had that dream.

So yall please, I need to find out if that is fate or who's fate is it? Because I had had that dream at least 20 times this year...

Hand in my Hair,"Michigan, United States",Apparitions / Voices / Touches,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Apparitions / Voices / Touches :: Hand in my Hair

W hen I met my friend Kristin, I'll admit I thought she was a little crazy when she told me she had a ghost ""living"" in her room. So I decided that I would prove her wrong by spending the night in her room with her. As we prepared for bed, nothing strange had happened so I thought that there was no way that something could happen.

We sat up for a while and were telling stories, that was when something strange happened (the whole night my hair had been down and there was no fan blowing). But I felt what I presumed to be a human hand slide under my hair and caress the back of my neck, flipping my hair out as it pulled away. I almost ended up in my friend's lap due to my fear, then to my amazement, my friend reprimanded the ghost. And it never bothered me again as long as I was there.

A short time later, I found that the small town she live in was built on an old Indian burial ground, and after that, most of the town had burnt down except for 2 houses both of which still stand today and belong to other friends of mine. I had slept in both of them, one of them being an old funeral home, and I had always had the eerie feeling that I was being watched, and that feeling increased when my friends and I used a Ouija board at kristin's house.

The Man at my Sleepover,Canada,Family / Friends Visits,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Family / Friends Visits :: The Man at my Sleepover

M e and my friend were having a sleep over at my house. We were just about to go to sleep when we heard a noise. Footsteps. My parent's weren't home though. They were out having dinner. But I checked out the door. No one. Then weird stuff started happening. Like the light's went out. Then the door opened then closed. My friend was very scared, but stayed with me. I called my mom to tell her. She said it was just the wind. I refused to believe her, my windows weren't even open. We tried to calm ourselves down. But it didn't

When my mom and dad came home, she left. We decided to move because my parents had the same thing happen to them. But the spirit followed. The day after we moved, the same friend came. We had another sleep over and the same things happened. We finally got some ghost busters and they told us it was my friend's dad's spirit, trying to protect her. It was pretty sweet but scary. Now and then we're ok about her dad trying to protect her.

He will still love her. And she will love him. His ghost doesn't scare me anymore. I still remember him. Nice, kind, always taking us out for dinner and ice cream. I'm just wondering why he stays at my house.

Grandfather Passing Away and my Fever,"Georgia, United States",Family / Friends Visits,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Family / Friends Visits :: Grandfather Passing Away and my Fever

I t all started when I was 13 year old, I saw a shadow figure with red eye in my backyard. When I was 15 year old, I saw a white orb past my mother room to my room, out the window to my next door neighbor's house, it freak him out so bad, he fell in his toy box. When I was 18 year old, I heard a voice calling my name at times when I was home alone.

I was at school when it happened again, this time it said ""Come with me..."" Of course I shrugged it off because I thought my mind was playing tricks with me.

On November 8, 2004, my grandfather past away. That day I was supposed to die too because I got sick with a high fever. I was told by my mother to lay down on the couch but I said I couldn't do it because I was going to die if I laid down. It was 8:00pm when this happened, my grandfather passed away at the same time and I got worst. I was crying so bad because it hurt at that time. My mother decided to call my dad who was up with my grandfather. My dad got worried about me also because I was really sick and he thought I might died too.

Later my mom told me that my grandfather passed away and I cried so much because I was so connected to him. Later that night, while I cried myself to sleep, I saw this shadow figure next to me, it sat on my bed and I quietly slept. I thought to myself that it was my grandfather trying to cheer me up. I started hearing more voices calling my name.

Now I'm 20 year old, every now and then I would hear voices and coughing like an old man. I have been possessed by a demon for a while, but I kicked it out of my body because I'm very strong in spiritual power I was born with and I got rid of it.

Spiritual Sexual Predators,"New Jersey, United States",Succubus / Incubus / Sexual Ghosts,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Succubus / Incubus / Sexual Ghosts :: Spiritual Sexual Predators

I t seems like someone or something does not want me to tell this story. This is my second try. I must have pressed something I shouldn't have and the story disappeared. My story involves spiritual sexual predators.

My husband was an alcoholic and died when he was fairly young (52 years old). He had a stroke 5 years previous and then subsequently developed heart failure and cancer. He died two days before Christmas 1998.

I have felt walking on the bed for a while, I can't remember when it started. My daughter felt this also. My husband, while napping in his bed after his stroke would often tell me to get the cat out of the room. The cat was never in his room. He never believed in spirits. That is until the week before he entered the hospital for the last time. He was sitting at the edge of the bed shaken and pale. He said that something had just jumped on his bed. It must have been pretty strong for him to relay this message to me. That is when I realized that what I was experiencing was not in my head.

August 1, 1999 was the day I will never forget. I found myself in the midst of a frenzied sexual attack by spirits. I was scared beyond belief but I also was starving for attention. I prayed the whole time while submitting to their and my desires. I was resting in bed but was awake. The strange thing is that when I opened my eyes, the room had taken on a green glow, but quickly dissipated.

I was in ecstasy for 3 straight days. There was nothing else that I would think about. I realized at some point what I was doing and sought the help of a priest in a local parish. He just told me to do an act of contrition, and that was it. He didn't know how to deal with this.

Because I subconsciously don't seem to want to let this go, it has been going on for eight years now. But I still don't know what I am dealing with. Should I be afraid. At times I am terrified and will sleep in the living room with the light on, but this is rare.

Please, if someone can tell me what is really going on, I would appreciate it. I do want to tell you that one time I was half asleep and while this was happening I happened to see a reflection in the TV by me. I was a white swirl above my body.

A Man in my Hallway Looking Like my Husband,"California, United States",Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: A Man in my Hallway Looking Like my Husband

W hen I lived in Guerneville, CA in the late 1990's I saw a man standing in my hallway. It was about 2 a.m. and I was using the bathroom. When I walked out of the bathroom, I saw my husband, Mike, standing at the end of the hall. He was completely dressed in a T-shirt, hooded sweatshirt that zipped up, knee length shorts and sneakers. I asked him, ""Mike, what are you doing?"" Well, Mike answered me from our bedroom, immediately to my left.

I screamed that there was a man in the house. Mike jumped out of bed, grabbed his gun and we walked the house. Every window and door was locked from the inside and there was no trace of anyone in the house.

My girlfriend, Jackie, spent Thanksgiving with us a few years later and slept overnight on our sofa. My mother came over about 11 a.m. and asked how we slept. Jackie said, ""Great, until Mike came in at 7 a.m., sat on the sofa to put his shoes on...""

Mike happened to be walking into the room just then and responded, ""I just woke up and I wouldn't sit where you were sleeping to put my shoes on, I would sit on the love seat or a dining chair..."" Needless to say, all our jaws dropped open.

Another time, my son, who was two years old at the time, said he saw a man in his room. He was terrified, pale white, terrified. I was alone with him so we walked the house with my gun and there was no one about. I believe he saw someone though. No one can fake the bloodless, pasty white face of fear! Why would a spirit appear to my girlfriend and me as Mike, then appear as themselves (or someone else for all I know) to my little one? Maybe so we, as adults, would acknowledge their presence?

Demonic Apparition,"Tennessee, United States",Poltergeists / Physical Manifestations,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Poltergeists / Physical Manifestations :: Demonic Apparition

W hen I was home with a friend I had only been in Tennessee for a month and I had been staying in a real old home. The rumor was that a old man had lived there and had killed himself over his one true love. People said that he would wreck your home late at night if you were awake. Me and Lori (my friend) were determined to find out if that was true. So we shut off all the lights and sat in the kitchen eating and watching telly.

While we were watching Most Haunted, we heard real scary voices coming into the kitchen. Lori of course was crying and was not a happy camper. She said she could see him and he was a hideous type of demonic creature. I thought she was playing a real sick joke. Then a picture of my mum fell. My mum died of cancer. Then we saw a demonic creature in the form of a devil. I got scared and everything started to come off shelves. Then he disappeared and we knew that he would stop. Everything fell and all was calm. After picking it all up we went into her house. We didn't see no one. So I never stay up past 11:00.

It was just so scary. Could anyone help me with this. This is the first time I have experienced this. I need help. If you know what that could be, please tell me.

The Hand in the Shower,"Pennsylvania, United States",Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: The Hand in the Shower

T his next story happened to me when I was about eight or nine. I was at my aunt's house. Now this house was very old and I had been visiting my aunt plenty of times ever since I can remember, probably ever since I was four or so. At no point in my life did I ever believe, or have the feeling that the house may have been haunted, sure it felt a bit eerie when you were in there alone, but it had never really occurred to me that there may be something or someone else in there besides my aunt and her family.

My aunt's house is situated on the top of a hill, a bit isolated from other houses, there are many trees surrounding the house so you do feel like the house has a corner all to its own. On this particular day, my aunt was having a party. As usual, all the men were outside listening to the music that is usually a bit loud at those parties. Some of the women were inside the house, in the kitchen. I was alone, just basically wondering around in the yard, inside the house, anywhere I could find any sort of entertainment to keep me busy.

I felt a small pressure in my lower belly and decided I had to find the bathroom. I walked in through the front door (the bathroom is to the left as soon as you walk like two feet. The kitchen is two feet to the right.) and I went into the bathroom. I closed the door and began to unbuckle my overalls when I had the strangest feeling I was being watched. I looked up (the shower is right in front of the toilet) and I saw a hand. I knew, from the minute I saw it, that it wasn't just any hand. It moved slowly opening the shower curtain. It did this as if it wasn't really sure if it should open it. I felt terrified. I wanted to scream but I couldn't. All I did was just stand there frozen in place. I literally felt like I couldn't move.

Finally after just watching the hand continue opening the curtain, I was able to move and I was about to tell my mom (who was in the kitchen with my aunt) what had happened but there were all of these ladies in there and I didn't want them to think I was just looking for attention or that I was crazy. So I said, ""mom?..."" she said ""yes...?"" ""I...nothing, just that there are a lot of flies in here..."" I know it sounded a bit lame but at the time I didn't really know how to explain what I had seen without sounding crazy. I went back into the restroom to see if the hand was still there and it wasn't. I got up the guts and I opened the curtain as fast as I could... And I saw nothing.

I later told my dad and he didn't believe me. I told him I had nothing to gain by making up this story. He believed I wasn't lying but felt he had to come up with some type of logical explanation for what had happened to me. My mom however told my aunt and my aunt told her it didn't surprise her that I had seen something, because everyone in the family had experienced things as well. Some which were a finger to the lips, boots stepping on what sounded like chips, a man standing at the foot of one of my uncles' bed, a man standing outside the window of my other uncle's room, even though it was a third floor.

Supposedly the story was that three men had died in that house. One on the very top floor, the other one in the basement and they didn't know where the third man had died. I haven't been in that house for a while. The house had been blessed sometime after that happened to me. Whether things are still happening I'm not quite sure, but for some reason I would like to go back there and see if I experience anything else... Bad idea? lol.

The Winchester Experience,"California, United States",Ghost Tours & Haunted Hotels,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Ghost Tours & Haunted Hotels :: The Winchester Experience

I 'm 15 years old currently, when I visited the Winchester house I was 14. It was summer of last year, and my family had taken a trip out to see my aunt for Fourth of July like we usually do. It was the second to last day we would be driving back home, and my mother and I wanted desperately to go visit the Winchester house again. The last time I visited I was very young, but I do remember a fair bit about it. It brought back sad memories of my father being with me the last time I was there (he moved away to Kansas and remarried).

We took my younger sister, as well. As we started the tour, the moment I entered the house I felt an overwhelming presence weigh my body down. In the 'Treasure Room' (forgot what it was called) I could hardly breathe. I could swear I felt somebody trying to push me down and pull me through the floor. The calmest room in the house had to be Mrs. Winchester's death bed, which was odd. I was relieved to have some of that pressure off me. It was intense, I can almost still feel the constriction on my throat as I staggered through the mile long house.

I could almost seem the busy servants as I walked through the house, as if we were back in time. The didn't seem to dislike my presence, but still seemed menacing and authoritative. I walked into the gift shop, and while my mother and my sister were shopping I looked out the window and I swear with my mind's eye that I could see them walking through the garden. It's hard to explain. With my naked eye I could see nothing, but when I just glimpsed I could see them briskly walking through the flowers and clipping the trees.

That's my experience in the winchester house. I know it isn't as exciting as everyone else's. I tried to let you see it how I saw it, and feel the same experiences. If you're ever out in CA then the Winchester house is a wonderful place to stop.

Camera Investigation,"Kentucky, United States",Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: Camera Investigation

W e came to the conclusion early on that our house is haunted, so we investigated with a camera and ourselves. We began in the back bedroom, and encountered several different life-like figures. We saw a man's face outlined, including his eyes, a woman's body shape, staring eyes, several voices over the microphone saying 'GET OUT' and rough breathing. We went over all data several times to prove everything to be real. Then we went to the smallest bedroom, which lead to more physical ghosts. They would quickly walk by the camera, and when we got close to a ""hot spot"" they would push the camera away.

In our main hallway, there was a small girl floating in midair with her hands up and disappeared into the walls. And lastly, a woman in the cellar with red eyes and a robe on her head holding a globe looked directly at us when we came down, she looked ragged and poor.

We have been living here along time and about one year ago, a black shadow man followed Jeremy every where he went around the house. At first we did not believe him, but then we encountered the same thing. We do not know what any of this is and would like believers or anyone to give us advice as to what it may be.

Abner's Haunted Ouija Investigation,"Texas, United States",Ghost Hunting,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Ghost Hunting :: Abner's Haunted Ouija Investigation

S outhwest Paranormal Investigators Research Documentation Case Number: H445 Date: 15 July 2001 Investigation Conducted By: Stefan Markus, Kimberly Schmidt, Jason Sanchez, Carol and Charles Sanders, Leola Anne

Excellent ectoplasm pictures caught: http://www.thepsychicfair.com/hauntedouijaboard.html

Nature of Paranormal Activity: An Ouija board purchased in 1998 by Abner Williams showed signs of strong Spirit activity as early as April 2000. The board had been loaned to an underground vampire/goth cult in El Paso off and on from around July 1999-March 2000. A different investigation was conducted on Mr. Williams during the summer of 2000 which we feel is not related to the Ouija board (case H371). Abner kept no written records of the activities, but recollects that the phenomena started around October with noises like scratching and nibbling, then knockings, rappings and poundings, bells and tones, and growls.

On one occasion Mr. Williams' neighbor Leigh Fletcher heard loud noises which she described as a ""heavy metal band rehearsing"" with screams, loud pounding, and musician notes. Items began disappearing and then reappearing where he had already searched. Then began actual audio contact, with a man speaking to Mr. Williams while in bed, and children at his window singing nursery rhymes. At the same time, the board itself began moving, setting itself up, and even reappeared by the house when Mr. Williams attempted to throw it in the trash. On June 31, Mr. Williams requested an investigation to be started by SWP investigator Kimberly Schmidt. She found blood on the front of the board in two large thick spots. She also took around 30 photographs, two of which showed ectoplasm mists rising off the board. The board showed cold spots which were random. During the investigation, it is believed that Ms. Schmidt was overshadowed by a powerful malicious entity. She began to feel very poorly with severe headache and weakness.

Mr. Williams states that he began to see an older crone-like image being superimposed over Ms. Schmidt, the phenomena became stronger and stronger, until it seemed another woman was in the room with him, this frightened Mr. Williams, and he asked the investigation to be stopped. The next day he handed the board and a few other items to member Don K. While in Mr. Ks possession, he experienced a large hooded figure standing over his bed, night noises, and possibly an audio contact of a growling entity with Mr. K's son. On July 8, Stefan Markus, Jason Sanchez, and Carol and Charles Sanders also conducted some tests on the board. It was found that not only is there two spots of blood on the front of the board, but the back of the board is almost entirely covered in blood, some in thicker streaks. Two samples were taken for analysis (pending). There were also minute drops of blood on the outside of the box. More photographs were taken, one showing orb activity. No temperature variance was noted. SWP psychic Leola Anne conducted a spirit contact, and found a strong male entity who called himself at one point Bertram and at another point Mitchell B. The entity stated it wanted contact, wanted to communicate with other living beings, and also wanted blood. A weaker entity, female, unnamed, came through. She seemed very negative in nature and got pleasure from pinching Carol Sanders, who was present, but not active in the spirit contact.

Witnesses and background information: Abner Williams, SWP member, Don K, SWP member, Leigh Fletcher, neighbor Tests Conducted and Results: Temperature variances: in the first investigation, cold spots were found on the board itself. Blood was found in two large thick globs on the front of the board, over the entire back of the board, and in minute amounts on the box. Spirit contact: two entities, one male possibly Mitchell Bertram, one female, unnamed. Photographs Taken and Results: Two photographs taken in the first investigation showed ectoplasm mist, one in the second investigation showed orb activity. Notes: While Ouija boards are popular in the United States to ""contact the deceased"", in SWP investigations, there are more cases of common household items becoming haunted or the center of poltergeist or psychical energy. -J.S. Outcome of Investigation: The board has been transfered to Drake Nigro of Illinois. SWP members have already issued a warning which is necessary with the transfer of spiritually active goods. A clearing of the board was not desired. Privacy or Special Requests: Mr. Williams desired the spirit contact transcript to remain private because personal information which was disclosed during the seance. No other privacy requests.

The Monk,United Kingdom,Apparitions / Voices / Touches,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Apparitions / Voices / Touches :: The Monk

W hen my granddad was a lot younger (late teens early twenty's), he used to live in a place called kemsin in kent. He would go out to the pub at the weekends and would ride back to his house on his push bike. He would ride back past the train station which meant him taking a small dark lane down to his house. He had done this route many times at about 12:30-1:00am, but one night, coming back down the lane, he saw a dark figure coming towards him. He was walking with his bike next to him at this point and as he passed the figure, my granddad said ""Evening"" but got no reply. Thinking nothing of it he just carried on down to his house.

A few weeks later, he was doing the same thing (walking back from the pub with his push bike at side). As he got to the lane, he started walking down it and saw the same dark figure coming towards him moving very slowly. My granddad had a light on the front of his bike which he turned on and shone it in the figure direction. He saw what he described as a monk. He said it had no facial features but just a round shiny ball where they should have been. My granddad was shaking from head to toe with fear and he walked backwards with his bike very slowly. As he got out of the lane, he jumped on his bike and road the long way round to his house. What he had seen on that night made him very ill with fear. He didn't want to leave his home for quite sometime afterwards. His dad asked the local police officer if he knew anything about it and he said they had got more than one report of the same thing.

If anyone else has any information on this I would really like to hear about it.

Woman in a White Saree,India,Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: Woman in a White Saree

T his is tale of the township of baliya near Varanasi in the northern state of Uttar Pradesh. That was the most horrendous night of my life, I am myself a bystander of all this which I am going to tell you. It was a friend's sister's marriage who used to stay near to my residence, just adjacent to my house there were two more houses and the Big Red house. How can I overlook that house, its depiction is still clear in my eyes as it was 20 years ago.

I was a tiny adolescent, that time scarcely 9 or 10. My friend who's name was Sonu, his sister who was getting married, her name was Sheila, and this Red house (as people used to call it) was rented by Sonu's dad for shiela's grooms family and relatives to stay for the marriage night (in India marriages take place in night at least until 3 am). The Red house was three floors tall and was not opened by anyone since 15-16 years. I went on the balcony of the first floor to bring some sweets as all the sweets for the groom's family and relatives were kept there. What do I see?

On the walls of the balcony which were 2 feet's tall there was a woman sitting in a pure white saree (Indian gown) with open hairs looking at me, she had red eyes and long grey hairs, she laughed stridently, and said ""what do you want, why have you come here"", she started crying now like a child and said ""go back I will not leave anyone... just go back from here"". I got factually petrified, I ran from there to call my mom. When I came up again with my mom, there was no one there.

Soon we heard a sound from down of yelling and weeping, when we went down (me and my mom) we saw that the groom was lying on the floor as he went inside the toilet and tried to fix the electric bulb, he got such a shock that he died on the spot. The marriage never took place, people decided that this place is having a bad omen, everyone evacuated the place immediately and no one went inside the red house ever.

Later, our Grandmother told us that there was a man who stayed in the red house with his mistress, one night the woman just vanished somewhere and no hone ad seen her after that night. After sometime the man was found dead inside the house. People say that the man killed his mistress, and this his mistress's spirit who still there.

This spirit does not allow any one to stay there, or to a ceremonial to take place even for a night.

One Scary Night,"Pennsylvania, United States",Apparitions / Voices / Touches,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Apparitions / Voices / Touches :: One Scary Night

M y scary night all started at about 8:30 pm. Me and my sister were watching a scary movie which I will keep untitled but it was about ghosts. We watched half of the movie and then stopped it because her boyfriend had called. So I retreated downstairs to watch some t.v. until she was done talking, but I heard a giant thump in my basement and a moan of a human, so to make myself feel better I said out loud ""you aren't real"" about 8 times, until I heard feet walking up the steps, then I screamed and I held my cat thinking she would protect me. The door opened and a white shadow-like figure was standing in the middle of my kitchen, staring at me, it was a little boy, I could tell the age was about 7 or even 6.

I went out to the kitchen and chanted ""In the name of God what do you want?"" and at that instant, it pointed at my grandfather's picture, seeming like he has lost a grandfather or such, so I scream ""LEAVE ME ALONE PLEASE JUST LEAVE!"" I know he was only a young boy, but I was scared and now I regret ever speaking to him like that. But my night went on. After that I went to my room still waiting for my sister to call me back to her room to watch the movie. I thought I was going nuts when I heard laughing of an old man and then laughing of a little boy up in my attic. So being dumb, I walked up the attic steps only to see a little boy on a old man's lap, then hearing a moan, a scream, then a cry. That's when I started thinking of what the little boy wanted. I decided not to watch the rest of the movie and to do some research of my house and street. I found that in about 1934, a old man named Richard died of a heart attack and that the child had died of a broken heart of losing his only last family. He was an orphan for about 3 days until he died.

I am not afraid of this little boy now, knowing what happened to him, I try to comfort him by trying to talk to him. But please still try and tell me what you think could have caused his sudden appearance that night.

Get Out!,"Tennessee, United States",Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: Get Out!

I am about to turn 15 now, so I am still in the same house as that other story I posted. Last night I was sitting down on my couch while my parents and their friend were drinking outside while watching my brothers.  I was watching television and I heard my bedroom door open and someone walk out. I knew no one was in the house because our doors creek. Well they came down the stairs and into my living room and I felt the couch cushion bend down. Then right in my ear, someone said ""I am warning you. Robert won't be happy with you..."" It was a woman's voice. So I did what my friend told me to do and I responded with a ""Why?"". I heard the footsteps run out of the room. I was furious. It was the man who had killed himself and his wife. She was telling me that it was my ""curfew"". I ran into my room and I turned off my light. Then I heard a loud bang in my closet. A man's voice said to me really loud ""Get out""! So I did what it told me to do and I ran upstairs to my den. I sat there on the computer playing on millsberry (yeah so what I play on a kids site. I get bored.) I need help do I tell it to go away or do I deal with the presence and just be scared for the rest of my life in that room.

Night of Terror,"North Carolina, United States",Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: Night of Terror

O ne night in 1977, on the outskirts of Rocky, Mount NC. Off HWY 43, me & my family lived in an old wood white and black house that still stands there to this day. I always felt like this house was haunted because every night after 12 am. you can hear a chair rocking in the back of the house and in the living room around the same time, it sounds like a fight has broken out, you can hear wrestling going on, these are a few reason why I feel like this house is haunted. One night, while I was watching T.V, I glanced a shadow of something about 6 ft. tall moving outside my window, it scared the hell out of me, I screamed and ran to tell my mother just to return and nothing was there.

On Friday night, we went to bed, my mom & dad slept together, my oldest sister and youngest brother at the time slept together and me and my other older sister slept together in separate beds, through the night somehow something moved the 3 of us to different bed, we never woke up during the move, we all woke up at the same time that saturday morning, shocked, freaked out, wondering how could something move us through the night and never wake up. I woke up in the bed with my daddy, my mom woke in the bed with my the oldest sister and my brother woke in the bed with my next the oldest sister, it was very chilling, no one has been able to live there until this day.

If you like to be scared to death, move into this house in front of West Edgecombe school, you will think you're in hell believe it or not, this is a place where the evil never rest and it always sounds like something is running at you through the woods. On this back porch, you can leave the kitchen for a hot minute with hot dish water and come back less than a minute later to ice cold dish water. I found years later where the wrestling came from, I found out that, one night, someone was having a party and twins were there, somehow one brother had a girlfriend that he was crazy about, just to find out his brother was sleeping with her too, one twin pulled a gun out during a fist fight in the living room with his twin and shot and killed him there.

I'm sure now that this house is haunted and some poor soul continue to rock unpeacefully in this house each night.

Lady Dressed in Black,Australia,Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: Lady Dressed in Black

I heard this story when I had started working at a local nursing home which is home to around 80 residents. We have 3-4 spirits in our nursing home which all have different personalities.

There was a nurse who worked at the nursing home where I am currently working, who had suffered from post natal depression and after looking after 6 children and working long hours, she couldn't take it anymore, I was told she went home after her night shift had finished and had left notes for her six children and her husband. She had proceeded to overdose on painkiller medication. Her sister had gone around that day to find her deceased on her couch.

Since then, she has been a regular visitor to that nursing home and 10 residents and 5 staff members have been witness to her standing at the end of their bed, donned in a black dress and hood, and has been seen walking into residents room, but if a staff member followed her in the room, it was empty.

While on night shift, one night I brought along a pendulum to see if she was still there and began asking questions like ""are you grounded?"", ""would you like to be released?"", and so on and the nurse I was on with started asking questions that only the deceased nurse would know the answers to. We have found out from our Q & A with this spirit that yes she is grounded and she spends most of her time in the chapel with her photo. And that she would not like to be released, probably she may not like what might await her if she does cross over completely.

The chapel in which the lady in black stays or Helen, as she is called, has a very ominous and depressive feeling to it.

I'm not very good at telling stories, they always come out not the way I want them to... lol

Winifred Reed - Holy Soul,United Kingdom,Ghost Tours & Haunted Hotels,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Ghost Tours & Haunted Hotels :: Winifred Reed - Holy Soul

T he following is an account of what happened to me while visiting Great Britain in the summer of 1993. Wonderful U.K. Magic was sprinkled on me. I thought that perhaps my story would be of interest to others who like me, believe that death is only a light curtain through which heaven awaits. Through my eyes and heart, let me share my adventure with you.

The village of Arundel has historical value as a town dedicated to religious freedom. It has been one of the few villages where many of its residents remained true to Catholicism during the persecution of Catholics during the reign of King Henry VIII and Queen Elizabeth I. The Duke of Norfolk and his ancestors are the most prominent Catholic residents of the town of Arundel. The family castle in this little village is beautiful. It is the type of castle that we Americans envision. It has turrets, secret rooms, private chapels and ancestral portraits.

On our visit, the Duke himself was at the castle. His flag was up, indicating his presence. We spotted him! He was giving a private tour. We followed him as he described the history of family members in portraits (many dating back hundreds of years). We saw pictures of the Duke with the Pope. He and his wife are one of the most well known reigning Catholic families in Great Britain. His wife is an artist and has painted many beautiful pictures. They are auctioned off to help children's charities. Anyway, I was so touched by this family and their staunch history of defending their faith, that my heart could have burst! The castle church entirely devoted to the Blessed Virgin especially touched me. Here ends historical Arundel.

Here begins my adventure. When we left the castle we crossed the street and noticed a large church to the left. The church ended up being the first Catholic Cathedral allowed to open after approximately three hundred years Catholic Emancipation Act. As we walked along the side of the Cathedral, I felt a strange feeling. It was as if someone was walking with me. It felt as if the individual was behind my right shoulder. I knew that there was not anyone there. I then proceeded to forget the incident as I entered the church. The Cathedral was so beautiful! It had the remains of the Duke of Norfolk who lived during the reign of Elizabeth I. He had been canonized as a Saint for defending his faith. After we had seen the church, it was about time to leave the village. The family we stayed with had driven two cars into the village. (The nine of us could not fit into one car.) My girlfriend (who is Scottish and named Oonagh) and I wanted to shop, and of course the men (sexist statement), and most of the kids did not want join us. Therefore, my husband Paul and Oonagh's husband Rick, along with the children of our friends, all left to return home.

Oonagh, my eight year old Jenny, my six year old Christina and I decided to explore the little town. Oonagh said that there was a street she saw that she wanted to look and walk down. So as we walked down this little street, I saw an antique store with a statue of the Blessed Mother in wood for one pound. I decided that on our way back I would purchase it. All of us stopped for coffee and dessert after we had seen most of the stores, and when we were done, we proceeded to return to the store that I had noticed on our way. I picked up the Madonna.

As I entered the store, I saw a rather ordinary pink set of rosary beads (little did I know, how truly extraordinary they would become). A lovely couple owned the store. As I held the rosary in my hands, I asked them if they knew who had owned them. The lady told me to look in the back of the store. There I would find a sewing form with a photograph of the woman attached to the garments. The photo was of a couple dressed very well in a garden; the era approximately the 1920's. I asked them if it would be possible to purchase the photo. The lady in the shop asked the gentleman if they still needed it to sell the garment (the clothes in the photo were the same on the form) with the photo on it. He said, ""Oh, she can have it. I don't see why not..."" I said it was unnecessary to give it to me, that I would gladly pay for it. I told them that the reason I wanted the photo was that I intended on praying for her, with her own rosary. I thought it would be nice to have a visual representation of what she looked like. I said it was a tradition in my faith. I asked them if they were Catholic, they replied that they were not, but they respected the prayer tradition. I then asked them if they also knew the name of the lady, whose beads and photo, I now held so dearly in my hands. The lady said she would try and find out.

The gentleman in the meantime said that he had found a certificate belonging to the man in the photo. The man it seemed, was the brother of the woman. His name on the certificate said ""Benjamin Reed,"" and the date was 1919..."" He asked me if I would like it have it. I said I would. I said I would pray for him too. I offered to pay, and again the gentleman would receive no payment. At that time the lady of the store said she found a prayer book. It was dated 1879, and belonged to a woman named Ada Paine. Ada, it seemed was the mother of Benjamin, and the yet unnamed woman. She too, asked me if I would like to have it. As they would not let me pay for any items except the rosary (15.00 dollars), I bought several other items, including some beautiful jewelry. They had both given me something money couldn't buy. What they had given me was indeed priceless.

As we walked out and away from the store, I felt a sense of sadness. I had the prayer book of her Mother's, the certificate of her brother's, her photo and rosary, yet I did not know her name. I then ran back into the store. I asked them if somehow, they could find out what her name was. The lady in the store searched and finally she came upon another prayer book. This time, the prayer book belonged to someone else. It belonged to the lady in the picture. Her name was in the front of the book along with a date. Inside the book was written the name Winifred Reed. The date was 1918. Then the couple informed me that she and her bother had never married. It all seemed so complete! I was thrilled. There inside the book, I also found a dried flower. Simultaneously, I felt both joy and sadness. The couple continued to refuse payment. It seemed odd. To receive all these treasures for the cost of a pair of rosary beads. I was truly blessed.

When I came home, I recounted the story to my Mother. As I shared both the story and items, I realized suddenly, whom it was that was walking behind me at the Cathedral. It was Winifred! She guided me to that little store, so that the most treasured items of her life, and those that she loved, would go into hands and hearts that would equally value and respect them. They have indeed. The articles, along with this story, will be told by many generations of my family. She and her family are now permanently woven into the lives of my family. I am having the photo framed, and I say prayers from both prayer books. The rosary beads too, and being used once again. I thought that the story had ended here. It seems that there is a chapter two.

When we came home I had eye surgery. About two days after the surgery, I had a very interesting dream (yes, I had taken medication). In the dream I had awakened. I had gotten out of bed and walked to the doorway of our room. The door was opened. In the hallway, in front of a picture of the Blessed Mother, stood Winifred! She was pointing toward her photo, which was sitting on a drawer in the passageway. She was so heavenly and beautiful! It is difficult to describe her loveliness. It seemed as if her inner beauty was radiating. She had the most peaceful smile I had ever seen. She was wearing a silk or satin dress (era 1915) covered with an overlay of ivory lace. She also had a matching hat gloves and satin sash around her waist. As beautiful as she was, I was still frightened. I ran back to bed. Instead of my husband being next to me, it was my Mother. I said ""Mother I just saw Winifred..."" She replied, ""Don't be frightened, she won't hurt you..."" Then I was suddenly in our large bathroom with my Mother and Jennifer (Christina might have been there, but that part of the dream was vague). The door opened. In walked a most lovely female child of about eleven years of age. I knew instantly who she was. It was Winifred. She said, ""Julie, I have come to you as a child because I knew that you would then not be frightened..."" She was right! I could never be afraid of a little girl. I then rushed forward to embrace her! I could feel her. She appeared as human and real as any of us. Except, that I recall her hair had a somewhat different texture. She then stepped back and said, ""I wanted you to have the rosary beads for a reason. There were two little boys who died from a drowning accident. I want you to pray for them..."" I replied that I would. Then I suddenly awakened. I really believe it was Winifred.

Since then, I have said the rosary not only for the boys, her family, but also for any intentions that she desires. It is very strange, but I look at these series of events as a gift. It has made me once again recognize the existence of a God and the promise of an afterlife. It also made me realize that whether we are related through bloodlines or not, we are truly part of the larger family of God. And that family transcends time and space. I found out a little more about Winifred. I called the antique store (the name of the store in Unicorn Antiques.) and spoke to the lady, whose name I know too, is Jenny. The gentleman is named Roy. I recounted the story to her as I have just done to you. I asked her if she had any further articles or information I could have on Winifred. She told me that the garments were gone, and that there were a few things left. She promised to set them aside for me. Next she told me that she had some additional items, but that she would have to search for them. She also told me that Winifred had died within the year of 1993. She had lived to be in her 90's. She lived by the sea in an art deco apartment. The name of this apartment complex was called A slow Court. She told me that there was a neighbor who knew Winifred. She said she would try to gather more information for me.

In addition, I found out that she was from a wealthy London family. I told her about the clothes that she was wearing in the dream. She said that from viewing her personal belongings, she wouldn't doubt that she loved wearing the very feminine clothes I had described seeing in my dream. She told me that in her room, there had been many personal items. She had saved many things over the course of her ninety years. It seemed that she was sentimental. Jenny then remembered that there were white gloves that she had not sold. They belonged to Winifred. There were also white dancing shoes, but she regretted that she didn't save them. We discussed the two boys mentioned in the dream. Jenny said perhaps they had something to do with the reason she never married. I told her that I would call them again before I came out. I wanted to tell them the exact date I would go to their store. I also said I was happy to purchase the remaining items of Winifred.

I called them a week before my trip. The night I decided to call the store was about a month later. I called the store at 12:00 AM California time. Roy answered and told me that I should talk to Jenny. She wouldn't be back for an hour, so he suggested I call back then. I was tired, and I would have to teach the next day, so I thought I would either call another night, or call about 2:00 AM. I thought that if I set the alarm, I could at least get a couple hours of sleep. The alarm went off. I climbed over Christina, who was sleeping with me that night, in order to turn off the alarm. I then decided that I would call later. I just felt too tired to call anyone. As I went back to sleep, I had a quick dream with the antique store owner Jenny in it. Then all of a sudden I smelled the strongest and most lovely aroma. I then said ""Alright, Winifred, I'll make the call..."" I went to the alarm/phone and noticed that it said 2:00. I called and spoke with Jenny. She had already decided that I would probably want the remainder of Winifred's possessions, so she had put them aside for me. She also gave me the address of her art deco apartment by the sea. I said I looked forward to seeing her again. Then I went back to sleep. When I had awakened, I thought to myself that I had never set the alarm. I believed that I had indeed intended to call another night. I checked the dual alarm, and both times was not set to 2:00 AM, but to other time periods. I decided that Winifred really wanted me to make that call!

When I went in November, Rick, my husband's friend, drove me to Winifred's apartment and back to the antique store. Winifred's apartment was a beautiful complex directly across from the beach in the town of Worthing. I was unable to find out much about Winifred. Everyone seemed quite suspicious at my concern for an elderly woman who had died earlier that year. I did, however, find out that Winifred had been very ill before her death. I found out that she died in February at the age of 91. Her neighbor told me, that she had attempted during her decade of the 30's to contact her deceased Mother. It appears that she had a great deal of grief over her Mother's death.

I found her apartment. The apartment itself was still vacant. I was able to discern that she had a large window that faced the water from her living room. I believe that she witnessed the death of the two boys from that window. I speculate because of her illness and lack of mobility, she was able to see the boys, but unable to help them. It must have which caused her a great deal of mental and spiritual pain. It was interesting going back to the thrift store. I believe Winifred wanted me to return to this location.

It was there I was able to retrieve the last precious items of her family and her life. These items included a pair of white leather gloves, a prayer to the Holy Souls in purgatory written in 1959 (the year of my birth, I thought that this was interesting), a piece of 1930's jewelry, a toy doll's brush from France made from turtle shell, her grandmother's photo from the mid 1880's, some of her lace, and the prayer book of her remaining sibling, Dorothy. It makes me feel contented to know that our family has her treasures. I feel that somehow she picked my family because she knew that we would cherish these items, as well as the lives they represented.

I still don't know why this happened to me. I want to share this adventure. Although, I recognize that there are a great many people that do not share my enthusiasm, I somehow feel that I will find out what I am meant to do with this adventure. Perhaps, I am meant to do nothing. I know that time will indeed produce the loose ends to this adventure.

The 1817 Place,"Iowa, United States",Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: The 1817 Place

M e and my sister called it 'the 1817 place', that was the address, but it was over 150 years old. I was 12 and Jess was 14 and we were scared shiat-less of this place. My mom never believed us but we know she saw things... Here's the thing, we always slept together even though we had our own rooms because it was so frightening just to be there. We always heard loud noises coming from the attic that were definitely not raccoons or squirrels, you know what I mean. And you could always feel a presence in the house at all times.

My first experience was when I was sleeping in my mom's room, her bed was on the floor next to her door which was right next to the stairway and just as I was falling asleep, I heard loud clunking on the wooden stairs, just like when I walk down the stairs in my boots now.

The second experience was Jessica's, she was sitting on her bed reading, all of our beds were on the floor, and there was a chair right next to her which was empty but she looked up and there was a girl in yellow pajamas sitting in her chair. The girl had what looked like a cut going all the way around her throat. She proceeded to tell Jess about herself and her death... I don't remember how old she said she was. She told Jess that she and her baby sister had been killed by their father, she was strangled and her sister was shot... I don't remember anything being said about the mother but it might have been. The thing is that her father's room turned out to be mine.

The third experience was of me and my older sister Franki; we were all sitting in the living room when we heard a baby crying and there were no babies in the house. We went to the stairs because it was coming from upstairs and when we got to the bottom of the stairs we saw an infant crawling across the threshold of Jess's room. It crawled from her room to the bathroom, looked up, turned around, and came back. When she turned, we saw a gaping bloody hole in her abdomen, staining the blue gown that she was wearing with blood.

The fourth experience was mine; I was sitting halfway out of the window smoking a cigarette (I was a bad kid) when I looked back into my room there was a man standing there with the scariest looking face I've ever seen in my life. He had a double-barrel shotgun cocked in his left arm... You know like, open and waiting to be loaded. He was wearing overalls, a white undershirt, and boots... And when he turned his head the image resonated... Like, didn't completely move with him fast enough. He just looked at me, said, ""Get out of my God damn house..."" and left.

I don't what the hell went on there, I've not experienced anything like it before or after and hope not too. Maybe we all just saw what our imaginations wanted us too, but personally... I couldn't hallucinate if I tried. I'm too skeptical and it halts me in spirituality but the things that happened there were strong enough for quite a few people to see.

Who knows if we even believe it ourselves but we saw what saw and heard what we heard. That's my story.

Shadow,"New York, United States",Apparitions / Voices / Touches,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Apparitions / Voices / Touches :: Shadow

A few years ago, my friend was sleeping over. My mom took us and our brothers to Friendly's to get ice cream cones. On the way home, we were pulling into my driveway when we saw a dark shadow jump my fence and run from my house. We went to find it, but it was nowhere to be seen.

Another time, with the same friend, we were making a movie. It was a dark night and we were filming in my parent's bedroom. It was a movie about a robbery. We filmed most of it, and when it was time to sleep, we locked all the doors in the room, and went onto the ""bed"" that we made for the movie. With all the lights turned off, we began to get really scared. And suddenly, we saw a shadow run across the room and out the window. We both recall it wearing a yellow rain-coat.

The same friend was sleeping over again another time. We had just settled into our bed that was in the room straight across from my front door. We had the door open a little bit. When everyone else in my house was asleep except us, I looked at my front door, and saw the shadow slipping through the window to get inside my house. Shaken with fear, I pulled the covers over my head. When I looked back at the door a few minutes later, he was gone.

Crazy Signs,Canada,Family / Friends Visits,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Family / Friends Visits :: Crazy Signs

A bout a year ago or more my grandmother passed away. All of our family came to see her in he last days, after she passed, we packed up all her stuff and split it up to who wanted what. My mother being the closest to my grandmother got a lot of the stuff she had made on her spare time the last few years. One thing being a christmas tree she made herself that played music.

The first christmas after my grandmother's passing, my mom called and told me that she put it up and that she thinks that my grandmother is haunting it. I guess it would just starts playing music for no reason. Of course I thought that the first christmas without my grandmother was hard on my mom and she was just taking it hard looking for anything she would to feel close to her again.

This went on for months, she would call me and tell me that it was playing and that she has even put it away and she could hear it from the storage room. I finally made the choice to go to my mom's and take the tree from the house to set her mind at ease. I spent a few days there and visited her and noticed nothing out of the ordinary.

So we left with the tree, got home and put it away and thought nothing of it again. About 3 weeks after getting home, I was sitting on the couch reading a book and I could hear a quiet tune playing, so I went into the storage room, looked at the top shelf where it was sitting and it was playing. I've left it there ever since it plays every few weeks or so for no reason. Maybe my mother is right and it is the last reach out from my grandmother or maybe it's just a freak thing that happens, but I don't know how a trinket can play for as long as it has without being touched.

Possible Poltergeist,"Florida, United States",Poltergeists / Physical Manifestations,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Poltergeists / Physical Manifestations :: Possible Poltergeist

W hile I was in college, I lived in a college apartment for one year. I don't think it was a very old apartment building, and if anyone had ever died there, I was certainly unaware. I had three roommates - two of whom had lived there the previous year. The girl in the bedroom right next to mine moved in at the same time I did.

Once we moved in, some strange things started happening (the other two roommates had said that nothing like this had ever happened before). It started with the TV in the living room. The four of us were sitting on the couch, watching TV. The remote was sitting under the table that the TV was on, upside down. The back was off of the remote, so we could see that there were no batteries in it. The volume on the TV was a little too low, and I commented on it, asking anyone to turn it up. Of course, we were all too lazy to do it, so we just sat there. However, the volume bar on the TV started to go up, and remarkably stopped at a comfortable volume. We were all pretty spooked, but it didn't scare us too much. After some discussion, we had decided that if our apartment *was* haunted, it was probably haunted by either a kind spirit, or one with a sense of humor.

After that, I started hearing strange noises at night. Not like noises you would expect to hear in a college apartment complex, but very mechanical ""ticking"" noises. The part that really got me, though, only happened one night in my bedroom. I was in bed, in the dark, trying to get to sleep, when I heard a loud, ""THUD,"" on the wall behind my head. Immediately after that, the following things happened in a perfect clockwise circular pattern around my room:

The mirrored door on my closet shook. Right after it shook, my bedroom doorknob (just to the right of it) began turning rapidly. That stopped, and my bathroom doorknob (just to the right of my room door) turned rapidly. After that, my VCR, which was to the right of my bathroom, turned on and then off by itself. The window to the right of the VCR then began to shake. Then the thud behind me again.

I had no idea what was going on, and I had absolutely no explanation as to what was making the noises. Nobody else had any experiences in their bedrooms, and I didn't have any more after that, but the TV in the living room was still affected.

I've long moved out since then, but I still think it was an interesting story. Also, I was interested in theories on what, or who, was in our apartment.

"Knocks, Door Openings and Voices","California, United States",Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: Knocks, Door Openings and Voices

T his happened in the years late 1996 to early 2001 in Roseville, California on 113 5th Street. When my twin brother and I were three, almost four, our family moved into a white house with brown shingles. The house had a moderate sized front yard with a wooden fence, a big porch, a large living room, a moderate sized kitchen, a long hall leading on one side, my brother and myself's bedroom and our sister's large back bedroom. On the other side was the bathroom. I do not remember much about when we first moved in, but I remember feeling scared to go in the room and sleep. My brother and I had a bunk bed, he slept on the top and I on the bottom.

The first occurrence I remember was a voice that sounded like the voice of a Marylin Monroe type of voice. It told my brother and I these exact words: ""Draw on the closet, go ahead..."" My brother and I being little and naive found a crayon each and drew all over our white closet door. Our parents asked us why we did it and we replied ""Because the lady said so..."" Our parents not really believing us scoffed it off.

A year later, our family was all nice and settled in. We would watch evening T.V. (Usually The Price is Right) and snack on dessert. When we would hear these knocks on the doors. Sometimes from the back door, and sometimes from the front. Having no idea what caused it, we looked all around in the front and backyards. This was a regular thing every night, we scoffed it off as pranksters.

About three years later, my brother and I were out of the house and my parents were having guests over, when the back door was knocked on and it suddenly flew open. My mother screamed and my sister came out and looked surprised. Being the brave one, my dad checked it out. Nothing was back there. Later that night, my parents were discussing things with us at our bedsides. I got up and went to the bathroom. When I came back I tried to get in my bed and something growled. It was an audible growl that every one in the room heard. It scared us.

I am fourteen now and we live in a different house in the same city. And I still have heard unexplained phenomena in this house, if anything bad happens, I will notify this site.

Helpful Ghost,Canada,Apparitions / Voices / Touches,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Apparitions / Voices / Touches :: Helpful Ghost

T his happened about a month ago. I was baby sitting for my little cousin because my Uncle and Aunt needed to go somewhere important. I can't remember exactly where, but that's not essential to the story. I admit I wasn't the best baby sitter. The fact that it was all night made things worse for the lazy dude I was. My girlfriend was over that night to help.

We went to bed at around 12, (obviously putting the baby to sleep much earlier), I wasn't in that much of a heavy sleep, and this weird voice kept nagging me. ""The baby is in trouble, help it. The baby needs you..."" I ignored it, thinking it was just my girl nagging, as she always does. I kept telling her to stop, but she was a heavy sleeper and didn't hear me. Sometimes she talks in her sleep. I decided to be patient and wait it out, eventually the voice ended.

The next morning, they picked the baby up, and I scold her for nagging me all night. The next night, she no longer needed to sleep with me. But even when she's all the way at her house, there are still voices, ""The baby needs help, it needs help..."" Now I'm scared. I know now that it's not her. But I decided to ignore them and I slept through the night.

The next day goes normal, and I tell her about these strange voices. She doesn't know what to say, neither did my mother or father or any family member. I decided to hold this information from my Aunt/Uncle, not to freak them out. That night, the voice in my head yells, ""Go phone them, something's happening with the baby..."" I get up. I have no clue why I was believing some random voice in my head. I phone them, luckily they're the type of guys who have to stay up all the time (work related stuff). I tell them to tend to the baby. Uncle Tony doesn't believe me, but luckily Christine did. At that time, I was wondering what the hell I was doing. I almost apologized to them. But, I heard voices freaking out in the distance. ""We have to go"" he replies back quickly.

The next day I visit them. Uncle Tony tells me that there was a long strip of blood hanging from his mouth. They took him to the hospital. Apparently the doctor said that had he taken him any later, he would have died.

I pass this off as a simple coincidence, perhaps subconsciously I saw something and knew he was in trouble. That night, a faint voice echoes in my head saying, ""you're welcome..."" I woke up to see the faint apparition of a young beautiful woman, wearing something that came from some past era, I know not what time period. She waves her hand and vanishes.

Haunted Hotel Room,Canada,Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: Haunted Hotel Room

T his happened 3 years ago, a true Story, however I do not quite remember the name of the castle hotel, since it was a long time ago, but the rest of this story is true. The location was in Scotland, in an old Castle Hotel, seeing how I'm bad at names, but it was a few hours away from the city.

My family and I were on vacation tour bus. We were staying at one of our last hotels before the two weeks was up. For the evening, the group had a choice wether they wanted to meet in the pub downstairs or not. Seeing how there was already a Wedding there, I decided to stay in my room where it was quiet. My parents went down to the pub with everyone else. When I had my shower, the door was closed and everything was quiet, though the back of my neck hairs went up, as if someone was standing right outside the bathroom door, even though I already locked the main door coming into the room. After the shower, I opened the door, the room was empty.

I spent most the time reading / writing in my journal about my times there. I still had the back of my neck hairs going up. Someone was still in my room.

After my folks came back, we all went to sleep, there were three of us there, so my mom and dad in one bed, and myself in another. A big empty room in an old castle which was turned into a hotel room, for myself I'm a big believer in ghosts and spirits, same with my mom. My dad however does not believe in them one bit.

In the middle of the night I woke up to an odd something. I had to put my hearing aids back in, I thought I was hearing something. There were three of us, I'm well aware of my parents breathing and yes, snoring. But there was an off beat breathing coming from the middle area of both beds as if it was watching over us. I thought I was nuts at first, so I went back to bed. I can remember my neck hairs staying up all night...

When we were walking to the tour bus the next day, as we were walking to the bus to head to a tourist site, we were still at the hotel for one more night. My mom walked with me saying "" Did you hear an extra breathing in the middle of the night? "" I nodded. I remarkered that I thought it was all of us snoring, but then I told her I thought someone was in the room with me before they came back.

The second night at the hotel, I heard the extra breathing again, it was kind of creepy, but at the same time, I managed to get some sleep.

I loved that tour we went on, we went to old historic places, graveyards and pubs. I especially loved the graveyards. Some of the tourists with me were in groups, I was just wondering over the place slowly, taking my time seeing if I could sense anymore spirits, like the one at the hotel.

I still think of the trip a while ago, I miss knowing the exact names of the places I've been to, and the names of my friends I've been to, I look back at the pictures, and it makes me remember the encounter with the extra body in the room.

It was a true story, I tried to keep it short and easy to read. I did not put any names of the locations, (I really tried to remember them, even with the pictures I was looking at while writing this).

M y family dogs are miniature short-haired Dachshounds. Their names were Charlie and Cindy, had them since grade 5, when we lived in Toronto. They past away in 1999/2000. Cindy past away first, then a year or two later we got another dachshound from the Humane Society, after we were feeling better about getting another dog, while still looking after Charlie. Our dog now is Hidie. Charlie wasn't doing so great in the year 2000. With Dachshounds, they get bad backs, if they go on ice wrong, or jump down / run the wrong way. That's what happened to Cindy, we put her down so she wouldn't have to suffer the pain. With Charlie, he had one of his disks broken and he couldn't even walk.

I remember it was a sad day for all of us. Charlie was my best bud, I told him everything, from who I like, to who I hate. I know dogs can't respond, but they can listen can't they? He kept me company though my worst times. For the first few weeks after his passing, I didn't spend much time with Hidie, my dad and brother did, getting her socialized with people.

She sleeps in my parents room, with the door closed so she didn't go down the stairs without hurting herself. I woke up in the middle of the night to get a drink of water, and I thought I saw a dog in the hallway walking from my brother's door, to mine. I looked at my parents door, and it was still closed. I went back into my room , and I thought I saw my Charlie laying on my bed staring at me. I stopped for a moment, being half asleep, I wasn't sure if I was dreaming, or if he was really there. Of course, I recorded it in my little book I have, of any unusual things happening around my house, a friends or community.

The next day, I was sitting alone, my new dog was on my lap, without her collar on, and I thought I heard Charlie or Cindy's collar walking down the stairs.

Today, I have Hidie still, and we got another dachshound from the Humane Society, we saw his picture in the newspaper, and our Humane Society friend who works there called us up asking if we were interested in getting another dachshound.

We couldn't resist! I was staring at Norman (our new puppy) when we were picking him up at her house, his face looked so much like Charlies, it still does. He's a little skinner then he is , but just the facial expressions. Could Norman be another form of Charlie letting us know he's okay?

It's been 4 years now since we had Norman, I still ask myself that question whenever I'm down. Even when both dogs either sleep with me, without their collars, I still hear something in the hallway. Just hearing them, makes me want to hold my old dog up in my arms again, I never even hugged him goodbye, when we took him to the vet, I went with him to see him one last time but was very uncomfortable hugging, now I wish I have.

Last night I had my door closed, with no dogs in my room. I felt like I had Charlie or Cindy sitting by my feet. I'd wake up, and there'd be no one there. It hasn't happened to me in a while, the last known time that this happened to me was 2004. Since then, never felt anything from my two dogs that past away.

You know, every time I write something like this down either in a journal, or tell someone, I always get teary eyed. Either if it was one friend who past away in 2005 (I'll share her ghost story another night) or my grandparents. I love the memories, but hate the tearing up part. People who approach me afterwards always ask me what I'm going to say? I saw the ghost of my two dogs/ high school friend?

So many mysterious things that have been happening to me recently, I've been reading up on real life stories / comments, and other sites to see if I could connect anything to what I've been putting up with. The thing is, I think nowadays, I'm the only one in the house that knows the dogs are still around. My mom used to, but she hasn't said anything lately.

An Ominous Presence in my Room,Australia,Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: An Ominous Presence in my Room

F rom a very young age up to now, if I was home alone, I felt a very depressive and hateful presence in my room and it follows me around the house sometimes. My 14 year old sister won't even go into my room alone. One of my friends came over to my house to watch scary movies one night as it was samhain, but seeing as it's not a holiday in Australia, we just celebrated with some horror and thriller flicks. For the entire night, we don't know why, but we felt like someone was standing at my bedroom doorway and just looking at us. And we felt it moved in the lounge room where we were and we could follow the presence around with our eyes but yet we couldn't see it.

It wasn't just any ordinary presence, it had a very ominous feeling with it (where you feel like there is pressure on your chest). I had one encounter when I was 5 years old where this very deep male voice said to me at precisely 3am ""I'm coming to get you"" and naturally I was scared out of my wits!

I'm not sure but I think this may be the same presence that has followed me around for years. It hangs around just near my wardrobe and moves around at stands near the end of my bed and up near my head during the night. I am quite unsure as what to do, I do not communicate with this presence as I am not sure as what it may be capable to do.

Gravity Hill,"California, United States",Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: Gravity Hill

O ne time when I was still in middle school, I spent the night at a friend's house. Her dad suggested we should go up to a place called Gravity Hill. It was only a road and off the road, there was a slaughter house. After we drove up, the dad put his car in neutral and we faced up the hill. All of a sudden, we starting rolling and I was convinced the dad was joking and moving the car. But when I asked him, he pressed the gas and the engine reved but we kept rolling slowly.

After it ended, the dad drove back to where it started. But before he put the car in neutral, we got out and put baby powder all over the back of the car. Then we got back in and started rolling again. Thankfully it was really dark so we knew when another car was coming.

Then after the rolling stopped, we pulled over to the side and got out of the car. We took out flashlights and looked at the back. What I remember seeing was seriously creepy, there were shapes that looked like hand-prints over the powder. We ended up videotaping what we saw and went back home.

A few days later, I decided to look up where we went and the story behind that road was that there had been a school bus crash. Children died and the rumor was that the rolling was the children pushing the car to keep you from the same fate. Creepy Huh?

Sexual Entities Visiting Us at Night,"Oregon, United States",Succubus / Incubus / Sexual Ghosts,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Succubus / Incubus / Sexual Ghosts :: Sexual Entities Visiting Us at Night

H i all, because of your interest with my previous story , I thought I might as well start at the beginning with all this. It started, as I sit here thinking, almost one exact year ago. My partner and I celebrated our 11th anniversary by going to a local spa. To hot tub, swim, and have some fun for the evening. Bruce, my partner, at one point seemed to begin to shake a little, and had to catch himself, but was ultimately ok. We went on our way, and shortly afterward, he did it again, only this time, his eyes shook, and he went to the ground. I held him, and we said, ok enough, got dressed and went home. Bruce went to the the doctor, and they said nothing was wrong at all and that was that.

A couple of nights later, I awoke to see a shadow of someone up against the wall in our bedroom, up in the corner, and moved around, like it was watching us sleep. I told it to go away, it did, and I went back to sleep. I awoke a little later and felt something slide into bed, but I saw nothing. I fell back to sleep, then awoke and felt something moving the bed around, an undulation, a very sexual feeling, then I saw something having sex with Bruce. This was rather disturbing, but I thought maybe he was having a vivid dream or something. So I awoke him, and he was rather upset that I disturbed him, and he told me to stop playing around with him. I shook my head in disbelief, and said, sweetie, it wasn't me.

We went back to sleep and it began again. The bed began to shake like a lot of movement. I could feel underneath us, a slow, undulating rolling around, like an orgy or something, very slowly, intimate, and the touching was like the most sexual massage ever. I mean, whatever sense you think deep sexual massages are, this is a thousand times more intense. I could see, if you got caught up in it, you might have some difficulty in stopping. You could become addicted to it. I saw Bruce laying on his stomach and in full sexual motion, and I could hear moaning, breathing heavy, and shaking. When I went close to him, I could feel his muscles in his body being stoked, I could feel his buttocks being pressed against, and could feel an energy around him, like someone was on top and I could do nothing to stop it. I even laid next to him and held on to stop it, but it went right threw me as if I were not there, but I could feel this undulation, and almost electrical whirlwind around him.

So, I rolled over to him, held him and demanded in the name of Christ for this to stop. And it did, and Bruce woke up, rather freaked out. I laid there the entire night watching this shadow sit on our dresser, in the dark, in the corner, like it was watching our every move. As if it were waiting for it's next moment, where he or we are in between awake and asleep.

The next day, I had a long talk with my partner Bruce, and we agreed to have prayers as we go to bed and declare nothing to touch us, and a hedge of protection around us. I sprinkled salt and blessed water around the bed.

Now, as we drew to going to bed, we sat on our bed, and I held a prayer of protection, and asked Bruce to tell this thing to go away. We both felt a presence, moving about us, I felt a slap on my face, and then a bite mark began to develop on my right arm. It hurt but not bad. I told it, if that was all it could do, to go find a playground. Really.

That night, nothing happened, but when I awoke and got ready to take a shower, I had scratch marks all over the top of my torso, and in the back, where I could not reach. I immediately put it to video. I then began to set out a dictaphone in the bathroom, and heard entire conversations in groans, in with the white noise of the shower running. In time, I was able to get it to respond to me, and answer some questions.

I felt there were several spirits, I believe there was a vortex there. When I brought it to our apartment manager's attention (she is a counselor, drux, and sexual abuse), she told me, Mike, how weird, a woman just moved out of an apartment after 3 months of this going on, and there is a pastor at my building, who, in his 70's and has his son living with him while attending a local chef's school, is being thrown out of bed at night, or feels someone laying next to him, or pushes him now and then. We have become friends, they have come over to experience the undulations on the bed (sitting down to prove they can feel it too), and we would play the 4 hours of EVP's and they too could hear the same voices we did.

Now, I need to break, there is a lot more, this is only the first few weeks. This has gone on for a year now, as late as yesterday. I am beginning to ignore it, it doesn't stop, but it doesn't have the same affect it did. Do you want to hear more? This is all true, and I have wanted for so long to put it to writing.

The Beast,"Minnesota, United States",Misc,"W hen I was in college in the early 1990s, I had an experience driving home around 1:00am-2:00am on Interstate 694 in the eastern suburbs of Saint Paul, Minnesota. It was late, and I was essentially alone in the middle lane of a multi-lane south-bound freeway (no other cars within several hundred yards of me). Without warning or any on-/off-ramps, a car suddenly appeared within feet of my rear bumper with headlights shining brightly in my rear-view mirror. I was immediately concerned about gang activity or other potential dangers, but I could not exit the freeway... So I simply kept driving.

After several seconds of the car literally being 4-5 feet behind me, it violently swerved to the right-hand lane (to my right) and pulled alongside of me. I cannot remember the exact type of car, but I do remember vividly the dark color and ""beat-up"" appearance, along with the words ""The Beast"" written into the driver's side door. I also remember that the driver of the vehicle looked like a much bigger, more evil-looking version of Marilyn Manson.

Now I was frightened, but I did not know what to do, as I had no way to exit the freeway. I just kept driving. After several seconds, the car promptly braked and got directly behind my car again, and after a few seconds of tailgating me (with no on-/off-ramps available), the car just disappeared. The freeway has lots of light poles in that stretch of road, so I know it was not simply an issue of the car turning off its head lights (as you would still have been able to see other vehicle in front or behind you). The car was simply gone.

A Few Experiences 2,"Oklahoma, United States",Misc,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Misc :: A Few Experiences 2

O nce my friend and I were hanging out in my room, and we started to hear sounds like footsteps and bangs coming from the attic. The next day, when my dad was home, I went up into the attic to see what it was. There was no one and nothing up there to make those sounds. If you read the first A Few Experiences , you will or will not remember that my friend and I had Scelerophibia, so we were POSITIVE that it was a murderer hiding in my attic.

Another time, my friend was trying to get to sleep (it was at her house, I was not there) and she began to hear something tapping on the desk about twelve inches from the foot of her bed. She got up to see what it was, and it stopped. It began again when she laid back down, so on and so forth. She finally decided to sleep downstairs.

My friend's backyard backs up to a large field. She has told me that she can never go into the backyard at night, because she keeps getting the feeling that she is being watched. She can go into the front yard, no problem, but the backyard is NOT an option.

I am growing quite tired of saying ""My friend"" so let me give you their names. The friend that I will speak of most is named Saku, and the friend that I probably won't talk about as often is named Silence. Saku and I were going on a bike ride at around dusk. This was still during the time of our Scelerophibia. My neighborhood is connected to another, and we know of a path that goes through the woods, into the other neighborhood, and back. That is where we often go on walks and bike rides. Since it was dark, I was very afraid of going into the dark woods, for fear of a killer being in there. I realized that I HAD to, because that was really the only way back, even if I turned around. The trail basically goes in a circle. While I was riding through very quickly, I heard footsteps, not from animals, and twigs snapping, branches slapping against others, things that animals wouldn't cause.

Saku and I were at my mom's old house. My mom had gone to the store, I don't really remember why. When I was little, I had a life-size Barbie doll that now belongs to my sister who is four years old. We went into my sister's room, and the doll's head was turned to the left. We went back into the living room, but the next time we went in there, its head was turned to the left. Keep in mind that we were alone. We got scared, so we charged from the room.

In about half an hour we decided to go back in. The door wouldn't budge, like it was locked. The only problem with that theory was that there was NO lock on my sister's door. Finally, we got it open, and the doll's head was turned toward us. Something about it made its plastic features look angry. We didn't go back in there until my mom got home, when its head was turned to the left, the way it was before she went to the store.

The Bride,Pakistan,Apparitions / Voices / Touches,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Apparitions / Voices / Touches :: The Bride

I t was a week ago that my uncle came to my place. We were having a discussion on things that people think are not real when the talk led to ghosts. My uncle have had many experiences with them. I guess this one is worth telling:

My uncle and his friends were going for a drive about ten years ago when they had to go through a narrow road next to a cemetery. While driving he saw a beautiful girl dressed like a bride, actually like an indian bride (they wear sari of dark red colour). He was the one driving and he knew there were 'things' that had happened to people if they stopped to help such girls. Actually, he was into ghost stuff, he knew it was one of the haunted places and this girl was quite famous as many people had seen her, many had suffered, and many had been able to escape. He continued driving as if he hadn't seen her. After about a ten minutes of fast drive, he dared to look back only to find she was right behind the car. He screamed and drove as fast as he could (there's not much of traffic rules here especially at night, no cameras or anything. It's like do what you feel like.) He broke all the signals and started reciting prayers.

All his friends had been there all along. They too were suffering the same things. After about an hour, they came to a stop and looked back but no one was there. They all were very scared and had high fever for about more than a week. Still it is believed that if you take that road, maybe you will experience something similar. I have also told it to my other net pals but they all believe it to be some fake urban legend. Well I hope whoever reads this believes me cause I am so sure it's true.

Childhood Haunting,"Connecticut, United States",Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: Childhood Haunting

I feel I should give you the background on my home first. The house is about 117 years old and I have lived in it my entire life. I would say the haunting started when I was about three years old. My mother told my I had an irrational fear of being alone upstairs and some times even being up stairs at all! When I was about 5, I remember things started to go missing and then turn up again in peculiar places. One incident, my mother had a jar of money that had vanished and a day later I found it in my doll house, I had no idea how it got there. Along with things being misplaced, we heard disembodied voices, people whispering and my mother on several occasions came to my comfort because she heard a child crying and assumed it was me, when in fact it was not.

When I finally got my own room I was moved into what I now call ""the nightmare room"". I called it this because as the night went on and I stayed in this room, I started to develop a severe case of night terrors. Every night, I would wake up screaming from graphic gory dreams. I never watched horror movies as a child so when I described the dreams in such detail to my mother, she was shocked. Eventually I was moved from the room and slowly the night terrors stopped but I kid you not, to this day, I sleep with a blanket over my head.

I think the absolute scariest thing though was when I was about 8, there had not been much activity in a while. I was sound asleep when I felt the sensation of almost like someone gently tapping on my calf to get my attention. Well it was enough to get my attention, I opened my eyes and I saw a full body apparition of a young man by the end of my bed, I was so shocked I just screamed at the top of my lungs, and just like that, it was gone never to show itself to me again.

As I got older the activity slowed down, and now at the age of 20 they are almost never active. I don't know if they are just dormant or maybe they only show themselves to children. I guess I will never know.

On a side note in high school, one of my teacher happened to live in my house when she was young just for a short time. She confirmed that she too had heard things in the house and had small things go missing. Other than that tidbit, I know nothing about the history of my home, although I would love to some day find out.

Walmart Ghost Girl,Armenia,Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: Walmart Ghost Girl

I was at walmart with my grandma and sister. I was looking at the video games while my grandma was looking for a photo album. I was walking towards my sister when a girl with black hair and blue eyes was beside me, she was a bit younger than me. I stopped and then she began to run. I followed her but when I turned the corner she wasn't there. I searched everywhere for her. I didn't know what happened and why she ran. I asked my sister if she had seen the girl, but she said I saw you standing there staring at something then you started running. Then I asked my grandma and she said ""No, are you alright""?. I said I was fine but I was so confused.

Next time I went to walmart, I was staying alert for the girl. My grandma asked me to go get some milk. When I got there, I saw the girl once more, she was sitting down crying and mumbling something that I couldn't hear. I went closer to her and asked her why she was crying? She said ""Anna"". I freaked out because she knew my name! Then she said ""Hide me hurry hurry"". I heard a big bang and the girl stood up and started to run, I followed her but again when I turned the corner, she disappeared.

I still see her when I go to walmart and I feel that she needs help but I don't know what to do to help her. I hope someone out there knows what I can do to help her.

Unexplained Terror,Canada,Old Hags / Night Attacks / Sleep Paralysis,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Old Hags / Night Attacks / Sleep Paralysis :: Unexplained Terror

W hen I was about 12, I had the scariest experience of my life. My family consisted of Mom, Dad and myself. My little bedroom was just off the kitchen at the back of the house. I was (and still am) an avid reader and would stay up late and read. My parents would be long in bed and sleeping, they watched the eleven o'clock news headlines and went straight off to bed. I'd be up for hours in the dark, quiet house. I'd never had any uneasy feelings in the house and didn't see anything unusual ever.

So one night, after I'd just finished reading, I turned out the light and just got comfy. I wasn't dozing yet, that's how soon after I laid down that the most frightening thing happened. I heard my name called in a very harsh whisper. It was incredibly clear, it was definitely my name. It wasn't a friendly sound at all, it was angry. Well the expression 'my blood ran cold' was the best way to describe it. From my head to my toes I felt as if my blood in my veins had turned to ice. The hair was standing up on the back of my neck and there was a prickling all over my scalp. These were things that I thought were only vivid descriptions of fright but discovered it described my terror absolutely. I could not move at all. There was no feeling of being held down, I was just absolutely unable to move, frozen in place. It seemed like forever that I lay there terrified but it was probably a couple of minutes, the longest minutes ever.

Finally I was able to move and I felt normal, scared out of my wits, but the icy feeling was gone and my hair relaxed. I was way too scared to get out of bed (you know in movies they always say don't go back in there and they do, only to end up dead). No way was I going anywhere. I stayed huddled in bed for a long, sleepless night. That was the end of it, nothing like it ever happened again.

I have had a lot of other experiences with the supernatural but never in that house and never that horrifying or unexplainable. For the following 8 years I lived there and there were no other events. I've never been able to come up with an explanation or a reason. No link to any family tragedy or death.

Is it odd to have such an isolated incident like that? Let me know what you think.

Imaginary Friends or Very Real Spirits?,"New York, United States",Children Who See Spirits,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Children Who See Spirits :: Imaginary Friends or Very Real Spirits?

I 've been wondering lately if most kids who supposedly have imaginary friends are really just talking with ghosts? It happened with my cousin's daughter last year and now I'm seeing it with my daughter.

A month or so ago, my 2 year old started saying 'hi' and then talking gibberish to the ceiling, every once in awhile when I was putting her to bed. It always started spontaneously whether we were talking, reading a story or singing. One night, it happened and then a few hours later I heard her whimper a bit and then very clearly and loudly (we still use a baby monitor) say, ""No, no, no!"" When I went into her room she was sitting up scowling and talking with someone.

Fast forward. On Friday night she did the same thing again, only this time she said, ""Hi Brian! Hi Brian!"" It was very clear and audible. I work with someone named Brian so I dismissed it to myself and chalked it up to her practicing the name. Then the next day, we were out in the backyard, she was swinging and started saying, ""Hi Brian"" again. Still didn't think much. Then last night, putting her to bed and again she says, smiling and looking up at the ceiling, ""Hi Brian! Hi Brian! Night night Brian. Night night Ga Ga...""

And then it hit me. I don't think it is the Brian I work with she is talking about.

#1) Let me first explain that my niece and nephew always called my grandfather ""ga ga"". He has been dead for several years now. He died before my daughter was born. When I show her pictures, I call him ""Grandpa"" because we call my dad (her grandfather) ""Papa"" so there really isn't any confusion. My niece and nephew are older now - my nephew no longer refers to him as ""ga ga"", but my niece still does because she is autistic with a speech impairment and that is easier to say. They have both insisted they have seen him since he passed away. At Christmas this year, all of the photographs taken here in my house were filled with white orbs, and the largest ones were clustered mostly around my grandmother, ""ga ga's"" widow.

#2) Early last week, a close friend and coworker had her 30 year old son, Brian, commit suicide. Since then, things have been horrible for her of course, so I have been working a lot and doing everything I can to cover for her at work, as well as talking with her family a lot, making food, buying groceries, putting his obituary in the paper, getting her in touch with another friend whose daughter also committed suicide last year, etc.

So when I put #1 and #2 together, I got goose bumps. I asked my daughter why she told Brian and Ga Ga night night and she just giggled.

The obituary and cards from the funeral home (both with his photographs) have been laying around my house for a few days now. When the babysitter saw me pick up one of the cards, show it to my daughter this morning and say, ""Who is this?"" to see if she would say, ""Brian,"" the babysitter told me 1) She had started saying ""Hi Brian"" out of nowhere the other day while outside swinging (babysitter also assumed she was just practicing the name of the person I work with) and 2) Had been carrying around the cards and obit all week and saying ""Brian. Brian...""

This never seems to happen when my husband is around, but he completely believes me. He however thinks the Brian part is implausible because his spirit would be too confused to come here to visit after just committing suicide. Keep in mind I don't know Brian - have only met him once since he lived out of state. But my thought is that if it is him, he might be here because he knows how hard I have been working to help his mom deal and help his family in any way I can.

He was bipolar, but from what I have been told, was a very loving, gregarious, yet gentle soul. He was very much into music, nature, loved his dogs, loved his family and friends with unparalleled passion, etc. Maybe he wants to thank me? Wants to let his mom know he's ok? She doesn't have any other family or close friends who have children as young as my daughter at home so maybe this was the easiest way to get close to her?

Any thoughts? Should I do anything to help them move on if that's who they are? Should I feel concerned? Comforted? Should I ever try to share this with Brian's mom? (I would never share it now while she is so unstable, but I'm wondering if it might be of some comfort to her down the road if she doesn't think I'm crazy.)

Is It Real?,Portugal,Misc,"H i, my name is Sarah and I'm in my teen years, I've never had a paranormal experience yet I believe in them. I'll just refer a little background information first. I live in a flat which is new. I'm the first to live here with my family and only. My flat is (you can say/think) broken in 2 pieces: when you enter it you see the kitchen and the living room; then there is a door which leads into a mini hall, then to the rooms, bathrooms and work room too. I share my room with my younger sibling and our room as a bathroom of its own.

Despite the fact that we're the only people who ever lived here; I think I may have some entity in my room. Or maybe I'm paranoid. Yet our room is the coldest place of the house, along with the mini hall (but I can't be too sure, because the mini hall's floor is made of stone), I often get the feeling of being watched in there. For example:

It was in November/December last year, my sister, who was watching TV in the living room, asked me to look for something in our room. And I went, yet I was too lazy to switch on the lights; then I started to get the feeling that something in the darkness was watching me. My heart started to beat like crazy and after I grabbed what was asked me to get, I went out of there running. Like my legs had its own mind.

I thought it was the fear of the darkness kicking in again, after the same event occurring in other circumstances, one day it happened when I switched the lights on. After that, I couldn't deny that it wasn't just me. And I always got this feeling in the mini hall and my room.

After I read stories in this site, I decided to see if I had a ghost in my room or not. Because after seeing here the facts, I always looked at the place where I sleep like something could jump out of there and bit my head off. So I entered there and said ""in the name of God, if there's something in here, please state your business and leave!"". Nothing happened, but one toy of my younger sibling (a monkey which was stuck by one of its paws in her secretary light) moved like a soft breeze was passing by. Yet the window was closed. I started to feel afraid, fear won over my curiosity and I ran away, again.

Other thing is that I've read that, if we have a ghost, one way to know is letting a cup of water near our bed, if it evaporated it was true; the thing was that before falling asleep I always drink tea, one night I forgot and the tea didn't evaporated, so I don't have any ghost in there. So why do I feel those things?

I sleep there every nigh, never saw anything strange I think (I'm a little oblivious to paranormal events, even if it knocked in my door, I wouldn't get what it was!). When I'm in my room I feel normal, but I when I pass by, I look at it suspicious. But the real question is: do I have really a ghost in there or not?

A Flakey Feline Ghost,"California, United States",Pets / Animals,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Pets / Animals :: A Flakey Feline Ghost

I 've had many experiences with ghosts in my house, but none of them have been human. In fact, they're all feline, and I enjoy their presence greatly. The particular cat ghost that this story is about is named Flake (originally short for ""Snowflake"", but changed when we realized he was really a pale orange and not white). He lived a normal life for ten years, and then suddenly, over the space of several months, his entire back end stopped working. It turned out the 10 year old cat had a tumor on his spine. There was nothing we could do.

So we knew where he was the last few nights of his life and could make him comfortable, he had been staying in one of our bathrooms on the plush rug. And he was a flighty cat as it was, normally... He didn't usually like to be touched (unless it was on HIS terms, as in, he jumped into your lap, yes, you could pet him... But don't try to chase him down to pick him UP), and was afraid of every new thing that came at him. I was a new thing, and he was afraid of me.

We had a nice vet who agreed to do an in-home euthanasia for us, so Flake wouldn't have to endure a car ride to a place that terrified him. The night before the vet was to come to put him down, I was in the bathroom with him, because my adopted sister was in the bathroom we usually use. I was sitting on the toilet, and suddenly Flake pulled himself over with just his front paws, and nuzzled his head against my leg. I reached down and petted him, then got off the toilet to crouch on the floor and pet him... And he let me. His last day alive, he accepted me into the family. It made me happy and sad at the same time.

Fast forward to the one year anniversary of the night before he had to be put to sleep. That afternoon, as I went into our parent's bathroom (the other bathroom's toilet seat was broken), I saw him incredibly clearly, lying on the rug in the bathroom. The same place I saw him a year ago, as he was living in the bathroom at the time due to his inability to use his hind legs.

I blinked, and expected him to go away. When he didn't, I stepped into the room (I had to GO to the bathroom, after all) and shut the door behind me. Again, he was still there. So I started talking to him, letting him know that it was nice to see him, and asking him why he'd decided to come visit. I didn't really get the impression of answers from him, then again, I didn't really expect any. Squeak is the only ghost cat who's ever given me the impression of any kind of response, and that was just pictures and thoughts along the lines of ""Hi. Sorry I missed you"", or things to that effect.

As I sat on the toilet, he stood up and moved toward me. His paws weren't pressing into the plush rug in there. Not that I expected them to, with him being a ghost and all, but that's just the kind of little detail I notice for no apparent reason. He did exactly what he'd done the night before he died, coming over and gently rubbing his cheek against my leg.

I REALLY expected him to disappear now. I've never interacted with a ghost for this long before. And feeling his fur was the most surreal experience I've EVER had (even more so than when he brushed against me in the hallway about a month before). I had a sudden fear that he was saying goodbye, for some reason, and started trying to convince him not to leave. He's been here for over ten years, and while his eleventh birthday passed without him physically present for it, I whispered a happy birthday to the winds that night for him. As much as encounters with him and the other ghost cats occasionally flip me out, I also can't imagine the house WITHOUT them... Especially Flake, who I feel very close to, despite having only known him for three months when he was alive. I know my sister feels very close to Moe and Squeak (our other two active resident ghost cats) but I like Flakey Cat.

I didn't get the impression from his continued nuzzling of my ankle that he was going anywhere, so that allayed my fear a bit. Without thinking, (he'd been there and basically SOLID for a good ten minutes by then... I'd pretty much stopped thinking of him as 'ghost cat', and just gone 'soft kitty' in my head at that point) I reached down and petted his head.

I SWEAR that cat shed on me. I could feel the plushy fur sticking to my fingers. I kept petting him, though. And after I finished and moved to clean up, intending to kneel on the floor next to him as I'd done the night before he died, to pet him more thoroughly (it's hard to reach the floor from the toilet when you're as overweight as I am), but when I looked back down, he'd finally disappeared.

It was actually a jolt, to be honest. I had hoped he'd stick around, and I could maybe (odd thought, but I WAS kind of sleepy) pick him up for the first time. I never actually got to HOLD him, and only petted him three times. He was flighty and didn't really like to be touched, unless he WANTED to. Which was why that last night meant so much to me.

Mysterious Woman at the Intersection,Philippines,Apparitions / Voices / Touches,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Apparitions / Voices / Touches :: Mysterious Woman at the Intersection

T his occurred in Xavier Estates in Cagayan De Oro City in June 19, 2007 at around 7 pm: My friend Janelle said as she was entering the neighborhood after arriving from the mall that evening - she saw a woman in a long white nightgown stand by the tree with a man from a distance of about 30-40 feet. They were standing on the sidewalk at the intersection of Everlasting Avenue and the street to the entrance. The woman in the nightgown had her head bowed. She and the man seemed to be talking. Janelle said she saw them there for about 5 minutes or more. She asked my aunt (who was with her) ""Do you see them?"" My aunt said ""No..."" According to Janelle - as she and my aunt were walking towards the tree - the guy walked away and he turned unto our street (Everlasting Avenue). The girl in the nightgown faded away a few seconds later. Janelle asked my neighbor if she saw this man walk by. The neighbor answered ""No...""

A 25 year old woman living in the yellow house near the intersection died in March 2006. She met a guy at a bar and they agreed to spend the night together in a motel in the city. At the motel they had a fight and the man chopped her body into 5 pieces. Her remains were found inside the motel room a few days later. They haven't found the killer yet.

The Party Ghost,"Connecticut, United States",Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: The Party Ghost

I t was about 1:30 am on a Saturday, I had a bunch of my friends over for a sleep over, we stayed up all night long and we were camping out in my backyard. I said ""Hey guys I have to use the bathroom, I will be right back"". I walked into my house and went up to the 2nd floor. Then I heard footsteps walking up the stairs. I thought it was my friends trying to pull a prank on me, so I ran into my room and put on a mask. I could still hear the footsteps, I went to the top of the stairs and jumped and screamed to scare my friends. Nobody was there. I heard the footsteps again, but this time, they were coming from upstairs, then it hit me it was probably my parents.

So I went upstairs to see what they were doing, when I got up there, again nobody was there so I went into my parents room, but they were sleeping. I ran out onto my balcony to see if my friends were still in the back yard. They were all still there. I didn't know what to do, then I thought that maybe it was a robber, so I ran into my parents room and woke them up, my mom ran into her closet and got her gun, my dad checked all the doors and said that they were all locked. They said that I was just tired and I was hearing things, I said that they were probably right.

So I went back into my yard and we partied. At about 5:00 am, I got out of my tent to stretch and everybody else was sleeping. I went out and sat in a chair. I looked up at my house and saw a dark figure looking at me through one of the windows. I stood up to get a closer look, but right when I stood up, it vanished. I told my friends but they didn't believe me.

The next time I had a party, the same thing happened, but this time my parents saw it, they called over a psychic, she said that it was the spirit of the owner in the 1700's, she said that he fell off one of the balconies at my house during one of his partys. She also said that he was angry because we were having partys in his house.

A few years later, when I was about 15, the same thing happened but this time it was bad, my friend went to use the bathroom. I was having a high school party. When he entered the bathroom, the door shut behind him and locked. By the time we opened the door, he had a scratch on is face and said someone or something attacked him, we quickly moved from the house after that.

We had a church right next to my house, the church service bought the house and used it for the priest. The priest did an exorcism and there was no more reports of a ghost, but the thought of that ghost, I would never forget.

A Few Spooky Experiences,"Florida, United States",Family / Friends Visits,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Family / Friends Visits :: A Few Spooky Experiences

W hen my great grandmother was in the hospital dying, her brother passed away. Her siblings didn't want to put her in more pain, so they didn't tell her. They went to say goodbye to her, and when they came, she ignored everyone, except she had a entire conversation with the dead brother. Maybe he was her escort to heaven. I don't know what they were talking about though. This story was told to my mom who told it to me.

Also, me and my mom were going to comfort my friend after her mom's death. My friend told me she was ok, but she wanted her mom to send her some kind of sign that she had a safe journey. Just then, her doorbell and telephone rang. Weird.

One of my grandmother's friends husbands died suddenly. She was so sad. One day she went into his closet and there was no leaks or anything. His favorite outfit was soaking wet, but nothing else was.

My cousin was at summer camp and was having a great time. Her mom told her to save all the letters that she got for scrapbook purposes. So when she got a letter dated july 7th from her grandmother, she thought nothing of it. When she got back her mother said that during camp her grandmother passed away. Then she showed her mother the letter and her mother passed out. The letter was dated the 7th but she died on the 6th. This is what the letter said.

""Dear cassy, having a great time huh pumpkin? I can see that you have made some new friends huh? Hariet seems sweet. I'm in upper US now. My flight left yesterday. I'm watching you in my mind. Don't you forget Mom Mom you hear! I am still with you in spirit. Your momma has some news for you when you get back sweetie! Don't wanna spoil it! Well, I'm wasting your time, xoxo sweetie. I love you to death! Love Mom Mom""

"An Unknown Roomate, or an Old Friend?",Canada,Family / Friends Visits,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Family / Friends Visits :: An Unknown Roomate, or an Old Friend?

A n unknown roomate, or an old friend? I've been trying to think of an answer to that question for a while now, at least two years since the death of my high school friend in December 23rd 2005. Since then, I've apparently adopted a new roommate in my families home, in my own room. I share a room by myself, or so I thought. The last time I saw my friend was the last day of school before the Christmas Holidays. I'll admit it, she wasn't popular, then again, neither was I. We had the same problems though with friends, that we talked about. We only had one class together, but I see here before classes start at the beginning when we're switching rooms, or on break. I never really spent time with her outside of school, wish I did.

On the 22nd she was in a car accident with her mom, they were on their way to a relatives house for a christmas party. Her dad stayed home, don't remember why, but I thank god sometimes he did. They weren't very nice to the girl that died. They made fun of her behind her back, at least two out of five of them did anyways. Three of us just thought they were being mean to her. After the holidays was the funeral. The two friends that weren't nice to her spoke. I couldn't believe what they were saying, so I said something different that was actually meaning something. Her family and friends appreciated all of us speaking. That Christmas, I wasn't even happy. My aunt was over, and wasn't sure what was wrong with me. My dogs were trying to make me laugh and same with my parents, my other aunt and Uncle came over for dinner, I love christmas dinners, however I didn't even eat, haven't for three days.

About a month later, my roommate happened to appear. When I was sad, I'd hear a voice saying ""don't be sad."" When we were back, my teacher asked where she was. Again, I heard a voice saying ""Go on, tell her, it'll be okay."" So, I did, the teacher left the room for a few minutes, even when we had a class. I had some odd looks from people ""Why'd you have to tell her now?""

I got home that day and balled my eyes out with tears. I felt a hand on my back with the words ""You'll be fine."" 2 years today, I don't hear those words, but I do feel that I have a another roommate. It feels like the one in 2005, but I'm not so certain. Since I had her picture of her and her mom, and dad sitting here on a little ledge by my floor, the presence was there. It's kina nice knowing maybe she's around (or another one) but, for once I don't want her/him to wake me up at three am in the morning by having a shadowy figure sitting on my chair... Spinning around, like two nights ago.

It took me a year to move on from this accident. It's still buried in the back of my head, I still have all the news paper clippings from every paper about the crash, and her pictures from the paper. I've always wondered if my other friends have this roommate as well. Someone watching over us, my best friend drew a picture of her as our guardian angel. Maybe that's why she's here still?

Shadow of a Little Boy,"Pennsylvania, United States",Apparitions / Voices / Touches,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Apparitions / Voices / Touches :: Shadow of a Little Boy

T his story happened when I was 10 years old, which would have made it 1994. I remember school had let out for Easter Vacation. It was a friday night (Good Friday) and I got done watching Ghostbusters with my mom and step-dad and I went off to bed where my sister was sleeping.

To give you a lay-out of the house, you open the front door and step into the living room, right off to the right was my bedroom. There was a little hallway between my room and the living room and at the end of the hallways my mom's room and the bathroom. So if you were in my room, you could see into the living room.

I went to bed and my sister (which as one at the time) and I shared a bed. I woke you in the middle of the middle to a strange noise. The living room was pitch black and my room only had a plug-in night light, so it was pretty dark. I rub my see and I hear the noise again. I look into the living room and there was a perfect outline of a child (which was completely black too!). And the child sounded like a boy crying, saying ""Mama"".

Being 10 years old, I freaked out and screamed for my mom. My mom wakes up and yells ""What do you want?"" and I yell back ""Turn on the light!"" She then tell me to do it my self, all the while, this child is moving closer to me and I'm scared to move. My yelling wakes my sister up and she starts to cry, when this happens, my mom gets up and turns on the light to get her and I just about wet myself because the boy was about a foot from my bed.

A couple of months later I ended up moving out to live with my dad. But I returned to live with my mom when I was 15 years old. We were talking one day about that and how no one believe me when that happened. I guess a month after I moved, my mom, step-dad, and a few of their friends saw something black race across the carpet. And they would hear a child crying at night too. My mom did apologize for not believing me.

The history of that house and all the other house in that town I lived in was that they were all the original homes the coal miners lived in. The area was big with mining in the 1920's. Which was went the town and houses where built. It is sad though, how they were treated and was never paid real money so they could never get out of the life.

The Ghost in the Backseat,"New York, United States",Apparitions / Voices / Touches,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Apparitions / Voices / Touches :: The Ghost in the Backseat

T his story isn't about me, it's about my friend's encounter. My friend Matt was talking to his girlfriend outside of his house at night. Because it was cold out, he decided to sit in his car in the driveway. So he went and sat in the passengers seat. As he was talking to his girlfriend, he glanced into the rearview mirror of his car. What happens next, he swears is true and I believe him. He said he saw an old man in the backseat of his car. He did not recognize him at all, but he tells me he can still remember his face as clear as day. He described him as pale, he had a narrow nose, he was clean shaven, and dark eyes, almost black looking.

So he turned around to look back, but nothing was there. That is when he became frightened and jumped out of the car. He ran into his house. As he looked back into the car while running, he saw the man's face pressed against the glass, staring right at him. So he ran back into his house to tell his parents, who didn't believe him at all. This is where the story gets interesting.

When he went back to look into his car the next morning, the seatbelts in the back were buckled up. He also noticed that the rearview mirror was tilted in a different direction. So he decided to do a little research about his car. He found out that his parents actually bought it from a man they were good friends with. It turns out that the man's father died from a heart attack in the backseat of the very car they purchased.

So Matt asked if they could get a picture of the man's father, and it just so happens that they could. I was actually at his house at the time he saw the picture, and when I saw his eyes meet the photograph, his jaw dropped and eyes widened. I took a look at the photo, and he looked just as Matt had described him. The man in the picture looked exactly the same, down to every last detail. After that picture, his parents fully believed him, although they have kept the car.

Ever since that night, however, he hasn't seen the old man in the mirror again.

The Dog Whistle,"New York, United States",Apparitions / Voices / Touches,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Apparitions / Voices / Touches :: The Dog Whistle

T hey say behind my school, a man lost his dog, but didn't know it. Every time he walked around he heard a bark, then he blew a dog whistle. But the dog wouldn't come. Then he found his dog and out of nowhere, they were shot by a man that was annoyed with the barking. Now everyone knows that humans can't hear a dog whistle because it's so high and piercing, that only a dog can hear it. But the weirdest thing is, I can hear it. I saw the freakiest thing when I was taking my Social Studies final.

I was sitting there working on the final, when I heard this high noise. It hurt my ears, I had to close my eyes hard and cover my ears. But since I was in a room in school, everyone thought I was going nuts! I was sitting right next to the window. I turned to look outside because that's where the noise was coming from, and I swear that I saw a dog running around. Now it didn't look like a normal dog. It was glowing, and it looked like the wind. I couldn't believe what I was seeing. I closed my eyes, looked back down on my paper, then quickly looked back up. The dog was still there! Then I heard that high pitch noise. The dog stopped running. It looked at me. I watched it. Then it told me to look out at the soccer field. I turned my head a little, and saw a man about 5"" 4' walking around. He looked confused to me. He was about 6"" away from the school. Then I saw him dig through his pocket and take out a little whistle. I stared at it, he blew into it. It made that high pitch noise. I was shocked. The dog was still sitting there. The man walked up to the little dog and stood there smiling at me. Then he waved! The wind carried both spirits away. I looked up at the clock and remembered I had to finish a final.

It was the freakiest thing I've ever seen! A ghost man and a ghost dog. And I wasn't dreaming. Please, can someone explain to me what happened!

Something Running into my Bed,"Georgia, United States",Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: Something Running into my Bed

T he first time it happened to me, it was about 6 months ago. I was laying in my bed and was at that point where you are half asleep and half awake. I heard this deep exhale in my ear and it scared me so bad I jumped! I didn't think much about it though,t it might be the dog so I tried to go to sleep again, then I felt the whole bed bump like something ran into it! I was like ""ummm ok that is strange"" but again tried to go to sleep. Then I heard something like someone is leaning on my dresser and I know that nobody is in the room with me, so I just put the covers over my head. Haha! I know I'm a scaredy cat! Oh well!

The next time it happened, our air went out and my mom was sleeping in my room (I have a different air system) on the futon and I was at that point again where I was almost asleep, when I heard and felt something run into my bed, I even heard the wood crack, I looked up thinking it might be my mom, but no she was still asleep on the futon! I told my mom about it and she said she has experienced the same things in her room.

She says that she smells smoke at times when she is lonely, but none of us smoke! She has felt someone lay down on the bed next to her when no one is home. Sometimes we get the feeling of being watched. It doesn't bother us. We don't think he is there to hurt us.

Just thought I would share with you guys! Thanks for reading!

Haunting Presence in my House,"California, United States",Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: Haunting Presence in my House

A while ago, I lived in a house that I felt was haunted, but some feelings/experiences I found out explanations for. There were three main things I could not explain. I am not one of those people who run out a room scared after an encounter, but the first one, I would be sleeping in my room and I would have this feeling of being watched from behind the sliding glass door (it led to the pool/billiards room), I knew there was something behind that door (and I checked for high electromagnetic frequencies, which cause the feeling of being watched). Then I felt a pressure on my chest, but I dismissed it and went to sleep.

I had a dream of a man coming out of that doorway and then staring at me, then dashing out of my room. It kept on happening to the point where I started to sleep in the living room. When I would wake up, I would look across the room and in the hall, there was a teenager girl, maybe 16-18 years old, in a prom dress, it was lavender colored like a light purple.

The other one, I would see a man in the backyard in jeans, a shirt and a cowboy hat just sitting smoking a pipe. I did research on the house, it was built about 100 meters from a cemetery, it used to be a morgue, and the entire area used to be farmland. I asked the neighbors who lived there before us, they said there used to be a family, a mom, a dad (who drank a lot), a little boy and a teenage girl who committed suicide in the bathroom.

But I felt that these ghosts weren't malicious, maybe just trying to get help or scare me, after all we moved (not because of this) but new people live there now. I went back to visit my friend who lived next door. The house looks nice and everything, but for some reason, I am drawn to want to go back there, this I cannot explain. Any answers?

Donna and Evil,"Arkansas, United States",Apparitions / Voices / Touches,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Apparitions / Voices / Touches :: Donna and Evil

I was asleep in my room one night. I always closed my closet doors before I went to bed. One night, around two in the morning, I woke up to see my closet doors were wide open. I leaned up a little and there I saw, plain as day, a catholic school girl. I could describe her to everyone so well. I went back to bed only to have a strange dream about ghosts... In my dream I was in the attic of my house. My grandmother was there too. I saw a diary and picked it up. In my dream I was told to put it down because it belonged to ""Donna"". My Grandmother started leaving and I followed. As I was leaving, the door slammed in front of me and a voice asked, ""How much do you know?"" Then I woke up and the day was here...

Ever since then, I did EVPs and caught things, my mom's purse was thrown from the counter top. Once I was asleep again, only too see a different girl in the closet... An evil one it seemed.

I want to help. I sit at my computer and feel burning on my arm but no scratches. Then I get scratches out of nowhere sometimes. I was in the garage one day and I hate it when my shirt is a little tucked above my butt, so I went to pull it down and I heard something, but thought nothing of it. I went to pull down my shirt and I know I felt a hand or some kind of flesh... I was scared out of my mind.

My Aunt's Possession,El Salvador,Demons / Possessions / Exorcisms,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Demons / Possessions / Exorcisms :: My Aunt's Possession

I used to live in a small city (I would rather not say city for protection), where our next door neighbor was the worst ever. My grandmother never told us why this lady next door hated her so much. She sure got revenge at whatever the grudge was, but she was nice to us. Until this day, I do not know why.

My aunt came home from school very hungry. The lady next door was outside on the porch, when all of a sudden she asked her to come and help her get something out, because it was too heavy. As my aunt proceeded to go help her, I tried to stop her, but I was pushed by an unseen force. I did not see anybody by the door at the time. I ran to my grandmother to let her know what was going on, but it was too late!

By the time we went to get her, she was already coming out with a sandwich in her hand. My grandmother took it away from her, but she was almost done with it.

The same night, around midnight, we were awakened by the smell of something burning. I woke everybody up to help find where the smell was coming from. It was my aunt's room. I could not open the door, but when my uncle came in, the look on his face was as if he had seen the devil himself.

I grabbed his hand, and he snapped out of it. But when I turned to see who or what he was staring at, it was the scariest thing I had ever seen. My aunt was sitting in her bed, just staring at me. Her facial features were as if a demon inside of her were trying to come out!

For the next few days she became worse. It started by her passing out, and all the entities she had inside tried to come through. A little girl, a man, few demons and one that called himself the devil. I was so scared to be alone with her, but every time that she passed out she was next to me.

The little girl spirit tried to come through every time I was in front of her, but there was one entity that did not like me one bit.

One day I was passing next to my aunt, not knowing that she was in her possessed mode (I guess you can say) when all of a sudden she grabbed me. Her face was not hers, but that demon that did not like me (I say this because she sound like an evil man) I screamed so hard I almost passed out.

My grandmother called my uncles to get her or this thing off me. She pulled me closer and told me that he knew who I was and to watch myself, because one day I would not be so lucky.

I went to church and became a regular choir girl. I told our priest what was going on, and he offered to help. He gave me a little bottle of holy water to protect myself.

The very next day he came to our house but made it only to our door, saying, ""I cannot come in there! It is too strong for me. I need more people with me!""

He told my grandma that one of the demons was not just a demon but the devil himself, and that he was not going anywhere without my aunt. He said that as he was leaving, he heard the entity scream at him, saying that her soul was offered to him, and he was going to stay until he gets her soul.

He was so concerned that he came the very next day with three other people. They failed, and she stayed the same. Days turned into weeks, weeks into months, and months into years. Yes, this went on for two years! It was an everyday nightmare!

I still do not know how she got cured. None of my family members would tell me how. But I cannot be alone with her to this day. I feel as if the demon that threatened me is still with her, and I am afraid of her.

I believe in God. He loves me, and I know that He protected me throughout those tough times.

My Boyfriend's Mother,"Arizona, United States",Family / Friends Visits,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Family / Friends Visits :: My Boyfriend's Mother

M y story began a few years ago when my boyfriend Zach's mother passed away from cancer at 54. She knew she was going to pass so she took great care to do it her way. She set up a hospice nurse at her home in Prescott and had her family around to take care of her. She got very ill and Zach was told the end was close, so he went to her home to be with her. He was standing in the kitchen getting a drink of water looking towards the laundry room when he said he saw a figure walk by. He said he knew it was his mom, so he went back into her room and she passed a couple minutes later.

Fast forward a year and half, we are living together and Zach gets me a video Ipod for Christmas, along with a large Klipsch stereo for a home stereo system. The same incident happened more than ten times, I didn't even keep track because it happened so much. In the middle of the night, usually midnight to six o'clock am, the Ipod would turn on and start playing the same exact song at full volume. A song by Fleetwood Mac ""Skies The Limit"". (I just checked the play count on my Itunes and that song in particular has been played 34 times. I love Fleetwood Mac but I have 3,000 other songs to listen to and this one isn't particularly a favorite of mine.) No matter what song it had been playing when I shut it off, this is the song that would always be playing.

I always felt like it was her, Fleetwood Mac and Stevie Nicks were a favorite of hers. We have since moved out of that particular house and the incident has not happened since. Maybe it wasn't his mom but it was a strange occurrence.

A Laugh that is not Mine,"Virginia, United States",,"M y name is Amanda, and I'm 14. I've never considered myself a particularly extraordinary person, but I seem to be living in an extraordinary house. I've been living in the same place in Richmond for as long as I can remember, and things have been happening for as long as I can remember. On one occasion, the blinds in my bedroom window were a little out of position, as though someone had messed with them. It's very rare for me to even go near that window, and I never adjust the blinds. I'm simply not in my bedroom enough. I set them the right way and went to bed. The next morning, they were messed with again.

There are creaking noises in the middle of the night when everyone else is asleep and occasionally doors will open (just a little, not a whole lot) when there's nobody there. My mom has had stranger experiences than I have. She's heard whispers trying to get here attention, using her name, has been tapped on the shoulder, and has even seen a figure of some sort in the hallway. My cat was a witness, although I saw nothing.

These odd happenings are probably nothing you haven't heard before. However, there is one instance that sticks out in my mind.

I was 12 years old when it happened. It had been a perfectly ordinary day at school and nothing strange had happened. Then, after a normal evening, I started up the stairwell to get to my bedroom. When I got about halfway there, I found myself starting to laugh. There was nothing funny. No one had told a joke. I was just laughing for no apparent reason.

I happened to glance aside at my mother in her room across the hall (the same upstairs hallway where she saw a figure), standing next to her bed and staring at me like I had gone insane. I remember her asking me, ""Are you all right?"" I couldn't answer, though, because I was still laughing. Also, my cat Poki was staring at me as though he had seen a ghost, if you will pardon the pun.

I got the distinct sense that it was not me that was laughing. I was trying so hard to stop, but nothing seemed to work. Finally, I ambled across to the bathroom, still giggling, and started to brush my teeth. I said something to the effect of, ""Why am I still laughing? Brushing your teeth isn't funny..."" Just then, it stopped. I felt basically like a regular, somewhat-unnerved 12-year-old girl after that.

My mom told me that she felt someone sit down on the bed a few seconds later, but that she hadn't seen anything. Since we were both completely freaked out, we had to talk about it for a minute to get it out of our systems. She told me that the laugh had sounded strange, that it didn't sound like my laugh. She had also noticed Poki's reaction to the whole scenario. We both know that cats have better eyesight than humans. Although neither of us saw anything, it's possible that he might have.

You don't have to believe in my stories or believe in ghosts just because I've had a weird experience. I just want to say that I don't mind if there's a ghost or spirit of some sort in the house because I have never once felt threatened. I just figured that I should share my little place in the history of hauntings.

Ghostly Visions of my Aunt,Armenia,Family / Friends Visits,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Family / Friends Visits :: Ghostly Visions of my Aunt

M y name is anna and my grandma and aunt have had some ghostly experiences with our dead aunt, so I figure that these stories might be worth telling. My aunt died about maybe 6 or 7 years ago. My grandma was up really late one night cleaning up and doing bills. She heard a knock at the door, she thought it was her imagination so she ignored it. She heard it again so she went to open the door but no one was there. So she closed the door and went about her business.

Later that night, she was laying down in her bed when she had a ghostly vision or dream like vision of who was at the door. She had opened the door and saw that it was my aunt, then she opened her eyes really quick due to her shock.

My other aunt was at her house, she had not been feeling so well so she took a bit of a nap. She woke up a few hours later and found herself thirsty so she went to the kitchen. She was walking into the hallway when she saw a ghostly glow pass by the hall door, then it passed again but this time she saw it more clearly, it was a white glowing dress and it was the same as my other aunt's dress that she was in when she was buried.

Those are my stories, I am not sure if they are the best but I just really wanted to write these stories. Could my aunt be trying to say something to us? I hope someone has an answer, well until next time, see ya.

"Still Mystified, Still Haunted",Canada,Psychic / Medium,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Psychic / Medium :: Still Mystified, Still Haunted

H i, This is just by chance, perhaps, after I googled, that I found this site. I have to share my experience. I was 13 in 1978 and living in Winnipeg, Manitoba. My mother and I went to the airport to pick up an elderly woman from Indonesia. The woman's son is a family friend. I will never forget noticing from then-young innocent eyes how mysterious she was. Her name is Farida and she wore a purple blanketing wrap and had journeyed a long way to see her son before she died.

She was a psychic and also a friend of Dr. Allen J. Hynek, the famous ""project bluebook"" paranormal investigator. Apparently having had experienced alien visitation herself, she had strange round scars on her feet where an alien touched her with his hands, burning the impressions permanently.

She was over for dinner a few days later, where she amazed my entire family with predictions like, for instance, we would be moving to the west coast. (We did a few years later! To Vancouver!)

It was a cold winter night, I remember, and she wasn't feeling well. My parents had her lay on our couch. This is when things started getting weird and the next events had my rapt wide-open-eyes attention, which for a usually rambunctious boy-and-his-dog 13 year old, was a significant accomplishment.

Farida went into the bathroom and shrieked. She saw something in the mirror, apparently. She came back into the living room and laid down again on the couch. She died, then. The picture in my mind is still so clear seeing, for the first time in my life, discarded wrappings and waste left behind by the hustling paramedics who tried to revive her. My father called Dr. Hynek to break the news.

They buried her in the blowing snow in a cemetery west of the perimeter of the city. This is significant, because four years later, I came back from Vancouver to stay with my sister for a while, a short distance away.

It was during that time, at 17 years of age. I was asleep in a room with my young nephew when one of the first major events happened that began to naturally open my mind to the supernatural nature of our existence. I awoke and there was already daylight. Pretty normal, right, except one thing: I was looking DOWN at myself lying in bed! WTF! I could see my nephew, asleep, on his air mattress! I tried to shout out. I couldn't move my sleeping body below or feel anything and this went on for some time until suddenly, with me was someone I hadn't thought of in years! Farida! I came to with a strong electric jolt back down in my body and I was dumbstruck with having just encountered a woman who had died years earlier.

Oh yeah, right, you must be thinking, but honestly, I still don't understand how she was there, before me in my doppelbanger-etheric double-self up by the ceiling absolutely out-of-body. My skin just crawled again writing this.

Things didn't stop there. When I was in my mid 20's, my best friend Michael Gulka, a guitarist, was living with me in a house near the Fraser river in Surrey, B.C.

One beautiful afternoon, I was with his girlfriend Cathy in the kitchen helping her do dishes in our kitchen after a picnic. That was when I saw the biggest, whitest, moth I had ever seen, sitting on her back just below her left shoulder. That creeped me out because I am half Indonesian, like Farida, and in Indonesia, where people generally believe in ghosts and spirits, white spirit moths symbolize death. Cathy was into wicca so I kept it to myself partially to deny it, and in order not to freak her out.

The next day, Michael was with some people I didn't trust and I gave him a look and asked him to be careful in our driveway. The next night I got a call at my sister's place from Cathy and she was crying. They found Michael dead at the Flamingo hotel in Surrey. My girlfriend and I spent that night with Cathy drinking wine, and the both of us holding her listening to One by U.2. While she cried. It was Michael's favorite song. I couldn't tell her about the white moth.

The years since have been like being caught in an existential whirlwind where I actually saw smoke form into a being in a room once and seeing an incredible U.F.O. fly over me and then over the North Shore Mountains fast and quiet. Whenever I am at the ocean's edge and the moon is out and I sense the tidal force, I get a strong feeling of many other spirits calling from far away but I know that they are also very close by as well.

Song of Mavis,United Kingdom,Misc,"A round 5 months ago, I moved into a new house. Well, actually, it was very old. Older than my previous house. The lady who had lived there before me was called Mavis Lashley, and she had died 6 months before I moved in. Nobody in her family had claimed the house. This was confusing. (Might I add that Mavis Lashley's husband had died shortly before she did, and thus she would be feeling very upset and maybe that is what caused her to stick around, or maybe it is an imprint of emotion.)

After a while, I settled into the creaky old house. The place was like a haunted house, with a dark, dusty attic and creepy projectors and jars of mixed goo in the larder. The garden was full of strange but beautiful flowers. But about a month ago, I was laying alone in my bed. It was dark and the only sound at all was the creaking from the attic. Mum and Dad were downstairs watching TV. Then I heard short, quiet snatches of song, high and delicate. They lasted no more than a moment. There came about 15 of them, then the song fell silent.

I went downstairs to see if it was my Mum and Dad, turning up the TV. It wasn't. The TV was muted and my parents were half-asleep. Since then, I hear the song almost every night.

My Guardian,United Kingdom,Family / Friends Visits,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Family / Friends Visits :: My Guardian

H i, I am from England and my grandfather is my guardian. He often does what granddad's do. You know, drives you mental but at the end of the day you love them. My experience starts, in fact, with my sister. She was casually speaking to herself, aged 3. When my mother heard her, she asked who my sister, Toni, was talking to her. My sister replied ""It's the old man, sitting on the end of my bed. His name is charley, he often talks but he mostly listens"". Seen as my sister didn't have many friends it wasn't really an issue. About 5-6 years later, I was also in the same situation. I don't remember ever talking to myself but I do remember an old man but I don't remember what he looks like.

My mom got a similar answer when she asked me who I was talking to. My mom only really registered what had happened until she was in bed. She has often felt a presence in her room and sometimes feels him sitting on her bed.

May I tell you that my grandfather died when my mom was 2? Well, I was 2 when we first discovered our friend. I also feel very safe when feeling his presence and he often turns my music down. Isn't this what a Granddad's does?

It was my auntie that first came up with the connection, she believes in the spiritual side, as do I.

Two Men and a Cat,United Kingdom,Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: Two Men and a Cat

I was about 16, and was babysitting my brother, and my parent's friend's children (a boy of 10 and a girl of 14). We were living in Alconbury Village, in East Anglia. My bedroom was situated directly above the front door of the house (just for later observation). We had a downstairs living room, and an upstairs one. Downstairs, well we hardly ever used it. It had a few basics in it, like couches, and a small television, but not much else. The TV downstairs didn't even have satellite hooked up to it. Upstairs we had a lovely, cozy living room in one of the spare bedrooms, with nice big couches, a wall unit entertainment system with Sky hooked up, and a video player. My brother at the time really liked the girl I was watching, and her brother wanted to watch Toy Story. I'd seen it like a billion times, so I put it on for them, left them in the room, and went over the hall (my room was directly across from that room) to my room.

We had been in the house for about six months, and all that time, we would get the faint smell of cigarettes, or kitty litter... We were a non-smoking family, and had a dog (my dad doesn't like cats, and my mom is allergic to the dandur in their fur).

So as I was saying, I had just gone into my room, and turned on the radio (because it was time for a radio program called 'Late Night Love' with Graham Torrington, which played love songs and had people call in and voice their love problems), which was near the window, and the sat on my bed with a book. I was listening to the radio, trying to block out the sounds of Buzz and Woody in the next room, and got a few pages in when my radio started to lose the station. I got up after it had gone completely static, and put it back on the one I had been listening to. I sat back on my bed, started reading again, only to have the radio do it again. I rolled my eyes, and as I got up, I saw the dial moving! I froze, watching, and waited. The dial stopped finally, on Classic FM. I turned the dial back to my station (which was in the 90s, and Classic FM was 101FM, just to give an idea of how much it moved), and went to check on the kids in the other room. (And no, it was an old radio, without a remote)

Once in the hallway, I could hear speaking coming from downstairs. I thought for a moment that my parents had gotten home. But then remembered that I would have heard the front door open and close... And I hadn't. I moved quickly across the hall, and found that they had ALL fallen asleep. I was seriously starting to freak out, but in case I was just hearing things, I didn't want to wake them and look like an idiot. I went back into my room to find my radio BACK on Classic FM, so I turned it off and unplugged it. The song that had been playing on my radio... I still heard it. It took me a minute to realize that it was coming from downstairs. Remember my description of the downstairs living room? It didn't have a radio. Just couches and a TV.

I went into crazy mode. I turned on the stairway light, and began to creep down the stairs. The smell of cigarettes and kitty litter hit me, and made me cringe. It was so strong! I made it to the bottom of the stairs, and could hear that music playing, coming from the downstairs living room. I could also hear two men (they sounded like they were at least in their 70s) talking about something or other, although I did pick up mention of 'the war'. I peeked my head around the corner from the stairwell, and the light was on in the living room, the door ajar (we always kept the room shut to keep our dog out... Oh our dog was in the kitchen, I forgot this until just now... There was a baby gate keeping him in the kitchen, and he was whining quietly, but his tail was going mad when he saw me... He was a King Charles Cavalier) I saw the shadow of a cat approaching the door way (from the light pooling out of the ajar door), and I legged it back upstairs.

I ran into the upstairs living room and flipped on the lights. My brother woke up, and asked what was wrong. I told him that someone was in the house (not mentioning the spooky stuff, because I didn't want to scare him). He ran to his room, grabbed his baseball bat, and we went back down the stairs. On rounding the corner at the bottom of the stairs, I stared in disbelief. The light was off, and the door was now closed. The smells were still there though. My brother noticed, and commented as I creeped up to the door. I opened it, switched on the light, and the smell was overwhelming. Cigarettes and Kitty Litter. And the room was HOT (we kept the radiators off in this room, as it was so unused, it was a waste of heating, so it was usually ice cold in that room). My brother kind of freaked (and he'd only seen the aftermath), but I spared him the details. We went upstairs, I sat, terrified and joined them this time as they decided to watch Toy Story... again.

My parents got home about 30 minutes later... But I never told them about it. My brother never mentioned it to me, but he did tell some of his friends that our house was haunted. I don't think I offered to babysit in that house anymore (I went to their house from then on), and I barely stepped foot in that room until we moved out.

On our last day, just before we were moving (we'd lived there for about a year), I popped my head in, and was welcomed with the cigarette smell and kitty litter. I felt something brush up against my leg, and I heard a small, muffled cough. I said out loud, ""Bye guys, have fun scaring the next people to move in..."" I heard what sounded like a chuckle as I pulled the door closed to the room. As we pulled out of the driveway, I saw the curtains in that room move back, just slightly, and I saw the cat finally, it was a beautiful tabby, and it was just looking at me. Then I saw some hands pick it up from behind the curtain, and pull it away from sight.

Late Night Visits and a Toilet Guy,United Kingdom,Children Who See Spirits,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Children Who See Spirits :: Late Night Visits and a Toilet Guy

M y son has been talking to people. I don't know who, because I can't see them, and neither can my husband. I believe that he used to talk to my husband's brother, but now I have no idea who he is speaking to. His uncle passed away just after my son was born. We were living in America when my son was born, his uncle died three weeks later. I couldn't get my son a passport quickly enough to go to the funeral, so my husband went alone. When he came back, he was a changed man, and he insisted on moving back to the UK (he is English, and we had lived in the UK up until I was 6 months pregnant with my son). Anyway, details... so we moved back, and we were staying across the hall from the room in which my brother-in-law had died. My son was staying in that room. He would go to bed around 7 or 8, and we would hear him on the baby monitor talking gibberish (he was a late starter when it came to talking properly, and still struggles from time to time) but when we went up stairs and asked him who he was talking to, he would just point... to nothing... usually the curtain though. This happened quite a lot, and when we moved out, it stopped.

Now we are living with my in-laws again, this time in a new flat complex in Devon. The new flats were built on top of an old retirement home. I didn't think much of it, but doors open by themselves, I hear people walking around on the laminate flooring when everyone's asleep, and I constantly feel like I'm being watched. It's not a bad feeling I get from the house, but I do feel like we're not alone in that flat. Now, my son is almost potty trained, but sometimes he'll wet himself either on the floor in the bathroom, or as he is leaving the bathroom. We thought that these were just accidents, but when we asked him why he did it... he said it was because there was a guy in the bathroom. I took him into the bathroom one day, and I asked him where the guy was. He pointed into the toilet, and said the guy's there. I asked him if the guy was there now, and he said no, and quite happily then went to the toilet.

It's made me a little apprehensive about him going to the bathroom alone, but I don't want to give him a complex, or scare him... he seems scared enough of the guy as it is... which also worries me, because my son isn't scared of much.

I was completely fine with his uncle visiting for late night chats... but this new development in the toilet has kind of freaked me out. I've had experiences with ghosts before, so it's not so much that it's a ghost that scares me, it's the fact that it seems to be bothering my normally unflinching son.

Dark Figure with a Red Eye,Australia,Apparitions / Voices / Touches,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Apparitions / Voices / Touches :: Dark Figure with a Red Eye

M y encounter took place at a farmhouse in Lammington National Park (WH), Queensland, Australia. The farmhouse is very old, around 100 years old (I think) and was previously owned by the O'Reilly family - one of whom is famous for his rescue of the survivors of a crashed plane.

The house is regularly rented out to holidayers and I have stayed there on several occasions. On my last of these several years ago, I swear I saw something which I can only guess was a ghost.

As anyone who has ever been in the country will know, it gets very dark at night. This, plus the layout of the house, made it a great place to play hide-and-seek-in-the-dark. STOP LAUGHING IT'S A GREAT GAME.

I was the seeker and decided to search in the main bedroom. There was a fire in the room opposite so I could vaguely make the contents of the room. However as I entered I suddenly stopped as directly in front of me a pitch-black shape appeared out of thin-air.

I can't specifically describe the shape as it didn't seem to have a distinct edge and seemed to be constantly changing. It was however roughly my height and width. The thing itself was completely pitch-black, despite the fire behind me. I could also make out the contents of the room on either side of this thing.

Almost as soon as it had appeared a very dark red point of light - where I imagine it's right eye would have been - appeared and began to grow brighter.

At this point I felt no fear, merely surprise and confusion at its sudden and unexpected appearance. I had never before seen anything like it. I did however decide that I no longer wanted to enter that room and so quickly walked backwards out of there. As I did so the red eye began to fade again and the entire thing vanished.

After having explored the rest of the house and finding all but one of the hiders, I decided it was time to search the main bedroom again. This time, no strange shape challenged me and I quickly found the last hider on top of the wardrobe. Thinking that what I had seen could possibly have been him, I asked if he had been there the entire game, to which he said he had. It was also obvious that there could have been no way for him to have gotten up or down off from that wardrobe without making enough noise for me to hear him from anywhere else in the house. It is only a small house but is very cluttered and very rickety. The floor creaks at every step.

I don't know what it is I saw that night and I honestly have no interest in finding out, I just wanted to share my experience with others. It was an amazing experience and makes a great camp fire story.

An Old Friend,Chile,Family / Friends Visits,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Family / Friends Visits :: An Old Friend

T his actual happened to a friend of my great grandmother. I know it's all true because everyone in my family is very honest and does not lie. Enjoy the TRUE story! Well he went to the very south of Chile. To do that, he had to take a bus to another city, then take a plane. When he just got off the bus, he met an old friend that he had not seen in several years.

It was years since they talked, so they chatted a while. My great grandmother's friend looked at his watch and saw that his plane was going to leave soon. He told his friend but his friend held him back and kept on talking. He ended up losing this plane. My grandmother's friend said ""I'd go home and get another flight later"".

He said goodbye to his friend and took another bus back home. Some time later, he learned that the flight that he was supposed go on crashed, killing all its passengers. He wanted to thank his friend for keeping him from taking that flight. Then he mentioned the story to another friend who looked at him surprised and responded, ""That can't not be true *** (I completely forgot the name!) died a few years ago...""

He kept on wondering how did this happen? He asked all his friends, all replied the same...

Party Gone Wrong,"California, United States",Apparitions / Voices / Touches,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Apparitions / Voices / Touches :: Party Gone Wrong

M y best friend, Cassie, and five other friend (including her little brother, Jason) were hanging out at Cassie's house. There is a house that is about a mile down the road from where Cassie lives that everyone says is haunted. We never thought much of it until the night of Cassie's 15th birthday party.

We all walked to the old house and were looking down the well when Sandra decided she wanted to go back because she was creeped out. So everyone but Jason, Cassie, and I went with them to go back. Cassie and I sent Jason back to the house to make sure they got back and we stayed in the house in case they decided to turn around and come back because they didn't know the trails that they took and it was easy to get lost. Jason came back and said they didn't make it back (thirty minutes later and it should have taken about five), we sent him home again and went out back of the old house to see if they were back, there but no one was there so we went back into the old house.

We heard a loud crash in the kitchen and Cassie and I both jumped. Cassie and I both yelled, got Sandra or anyone else but there was no answer. The wind hadn't blown all day and suddenly the wind was blowing really hard. We heard a soft whisper saying ""hello"" and I grabbed Cassie's arm. We started toward the living room (where the front door is) and when we got to the living room there was something in the middle of the room between us and the door. It was the figure of a girl that was smoky so we could see through her but we knew she was there. I screamed and ran out of the house with Cassie close behind.

We ran onto the street and I fell, but didn't waste any time getting up and we were sprinting down the road when her mom pulled up asking where the others were. It was getting dark and Mrs. Kell asked me to go with her to the old house to look for them while Cassie and Mr. Kell went to find them on the trail. When we got around back of the house, I heard a loud cry like a person screaming. Mrs. Kell and I went back to the car and we made it back to the house with Cassie and Mr. Kell. They said they had heard the same thing but thought it was us.

We still don't know what it was but we know it wasn't an animal. And to explain how scared Cassie and I are of that old house now, Mrs. Kell offered us one hundred dollars each if we would go with her to into the house with a flash light for at least three seconds and we still won't.

Boys in the Girls Room,"Kansas, United States",Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: Boys in the Girls Room

O ne day at school, I was in the bathroom talking to my friends. My friend was still in the bathroom. I said that I was leaving and she stopped me saying, ""Wait, don't leave they're here..."" I asked what she was talking about. She said that she has seen ghosts of little boys in the bathroom crying. She also said that if you look hard, that you can see them in the mirrors. I stayed with her and before we left I decided to look into one of the mirrors. Only seconds after I looked, I saw one of the little boys staring with a mad and mocking look on his face.

One more time that same day, I went to the bathroom to fix my hair and I heard soft music playing. I couldn't tell where it was coming from. Of course, I was the only one in the bathroom at the time. I looked over to the right of me and saw another boy smirk and he started to chuckle. He came running after me. I squealed and somehow I was frozen. But seconds before he could touch me he disappeared out of nowhere.

I once more dared go in to the restroom. Scared out of my mind, I shakingly struggled to go in there. I was in there for the longest time trying to figure out why they were doing this to me. Nothing happened. But as soon as I was about to walk out the door, I saw that same boy crying. He was kneeling on the floor, hovering over, what looks to be like his dead brother. This made me very sad. I took a few steps over to the boy and said, ""How can I help?"" The boy vanished. I'm sure I'll see him again soon.

What causes these ghosts to do this? And if they are real and not something I came up with in my mind, how did the little boys get in the Girl's restroom and how did they end up dying in there? And why did they choose me? Ah... The beautiful wonders in life

Barking and Noises,"Minnesota, United States",Misc,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Misc :: Barking and Noises

O n July 1st, 2007, I went to my cousin's birthday party with my dad, as my mom and my brother went to the zoo with my grandma. I am 10 and at the party we played softball.

Then after the party, my dad dropped me off at my house (my parents are split up). My mom wasn't home yet so I stayed at home by myself and I watched my dog, Bella. Bella and I were watching TV when all of a sudden, Bella started barking like crazy and ran toward the stairs. I thought it was normal at first, but then I heard noises like someone falling and tripping over things. I immediately called my mom and she said she was on her way over.

After I hung up the phone, it all stopped. So I just kept watching TV. Then my mom called to make sure I was still okay and when I answered, the barking and noises all started happening again! My mom said she'd be over in about 5 minutes and we said goodbye so I hung up and went downstairs to check. As I took the last step... It all stopped. Then I was really freaked! I was walking around and there was nothing/no one.

My mom came home to see me curled up in a ball on the couch and then she checked and found the same thing as I did, nothing, no one. I don't know if it was a ghost or my imagination, but I hope it was just my imagination because I can't stand living in a haunted house, like my grandma. But that's a whole other story.

Sounds of Heels,Mexico,Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: Sounds of Heels

I f you don't know already, I live in Oaxaco Mexico. My house is very old and many things happen here. My first experience was with my grandma. My parents had gone out to mexico city to visit my aunt who was ill. My grandma had flown in to take care of me and my brother william. I was 10 at the time and Will was 13, and we weren't really into the whole supernatural stuff.

It was summer and of course it was raining pretty hard. My grandma, Will, and I were cuddled in my parents King sized bed watching the news, when we heard heels coming in and into the kitchen. My grandma tried to look out the door and asked (in spanish of course) ""William, go see who came in it might be your sister, Teresita..."" He reluctantly got off the bed and went into the kitchen and came back really fast. He got back on the bed, ""There is no one there it was probably the TV or something"". We soon shrugged it off and went to sleep.

Later in the night we heard the same heels AGAIN. But this time it was getting closer soon to stop at the edge of the bed on Will's side. I woke up really fast and Will was sweating. I poked him in the stomach and he woke up... "" What's wrong?"" He shook his head and went back to sleep. I poked him again, ""are you hot or something?"" He shook his head, ""No why?"" I wiped his forehead and my hand got wet... ""You're sweating..."" He shrugged and took off the sheets.

When I woke up in the morning, Will looked really pale, and he had been throwing up. I'm still confused to why he got sick right when the heels stopped by his bed. I want to understand what had happened, and this isn't the only incident.

The Strange White Dog,"Connecticut, United States",Pets / Animals,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Pets / Animals :: The Strange White Dog

O ne of the stranger experiences I've had puzzles me to this day. Whether or not this even was supernatural or just a very odd coincidence, I will never know. It started off when I was a little girl, about 8 or 9, there was a path in the woods in my neighborhood I used to go walking on every so often. I used to go walking there if I was scared of being home alone in my house (see my first story , it explains how I was afraid of my house as a child).

One day when I was walking, I had gotten pretty far into the path when from up ahead trotted what looked like a white german shepherd, although the exact breed is not clear. It had no collar and no markings of any color and his fur was sort of dull but not dirty nor did the dog look homeless, despite its lack of a collar.

When the dog got closer, I put my hand out to pet it but it just walked by me, as if it didn't even see me at all, it never looked up at me, it just stared ahead and kept going and seemed to disappear quickly into the distance. I thought it was possible that their owner was further up on the path, but when I reached the end, I saw no sign of any person, not to mention I don't recall the dog belonging to any of my neighbors. I brushed the incident off and never told any one about it.

Well, that was until about 2005 when I don't know for the life of me what reminded me of the incident but I remembered it quite vividly. So I decided to tell my boyfriend about it. He didn't really think much of it until the next day. We had been driving for several hours and my boyfriend stopped the car on the side of a dirt road going through a woods like area (no houses for miles) so that he could well take a pee.

I got out to stretch my legs, I looked up ahead and trotting down the road I see a white german shepherd looking dog, no collar, no markings. The same as the last time it seemed to not even see me. I called to my boyfriend.

He walked in front of the dog and it just walked around him not looking up, he extended his hand to pet the dog and it just moved away faster and disappeared down the road. What had just happened? I had not uttered a word about the white dog for nearly 10 years and the DAY AFTER I finally do, I see it again! And this time someone else saw it.

Now as I said before, I don't know if it was supernatural or coincidence what ever it was, I will never forget the strange white dog.

My Cat Shuby,"Virginia, United States",Pets / Animals,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Pets / Animals :: My Cat Shuby

I 've always been a cat lover and have had cats since I was very young. I had a cat named Shuby. She was as sweet as could be with her plaintive little meow. She was a fairly large cat: at one point she grew to be 17 pounds. We don't know how or by what, but she got bitten when she was 9 or 10. As the bite healed, we believe arthritis began to sink in.

It became harder and harder for her to walk. After awhile, she could no longer climb into her litter box. We could tell she was in pain, having all her weight on her sore, stiff joints. Finally, we made the decision to have her euthanized. It was a very sad day, when we finally had to give her up. There were many tears. That was 2003.

Since then, we've had other cats. However, I believe she has never entirely left. I can swear I've seen her all over the house, mainly in the bathroom and in the hallway where she loved to sit in life. She has also been spotted on the bed. Whenever I see her, though, it's always out of the corner of my eye and she's not there when I look directly.

It's comforting to know that my sweet little kitty is still around. I hope she knows that it was for the best that she was put to sleep. Somehow, I think she does. I think she's just hanging around because she didn't really get to live a full life here because of the arthritis and she wasn't quite ready to leave this earth yet. I can only guess, though.

The Shadow People Remain,"Alaska, United States",Misc,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Misc :: The Shadow People Remain

I have to say that I am now officially freaked. The shadow people in my room are still there, only now they've started messing with me. And I mean REALLY messing with me. Every time I go to walk out of my room, I feel someone pull my hair, hard enough to yank my head back, and hear distinct growlings. I turn around, and nothing is there. At night, whether my light is on or off, the cat is with me or not, they appear. Of course, they only appear where there is shadow and there is one corner of my room that is always in shadow. Light or no light, I can never really see back there. I put my TV there so most of it is covered. Unfortunately, that hasn't done me much good. I still hear what sounds like shuffling footsteps, harsh whispers, knocking on my window, and... okay, my mom says this is just my imagination but... If you have a box TV, go up to it and smack the top or side of it. How can you imagine that sound? It wakes me in the middle of the night and it keeps going and going, tapping and knocking and rapping... I'm going insane!

A few nights ago, I went to go lay down in my room. It was close to midnight and I went to my room, shut the door, and just fell onto the bed. I laid there for a while, and then I felt something sharp rake across the backs of my legs. Well, I screamed and bolted upright. I looked around, thinking that it could've been my cat. He wasn't in the room and my door was shut tight still. I went to see where he was and found him sleeping in the living room... Right where I'd left him. I checked the backs of my legs and found three, distinct, BLEEDING scratches that ran across both claves.

Needless to say, I didn't go back into my room. I slept out in the living room with my brother and his friends. Who DID hear me scream, by the way.

Last night, I sat up and when all the noise started up again, I stared right at the darkest corner of my room and, though I do not practice religion, said, ""I rebuke you in the name of Jesus Christ..."" outloud, very clear, and very firmly. Instead of feeling better, the atmosphere in the room got real heavy and I felt like bolting out of there instantly. When the feeling didn't subside I told whatever was in my room to please leave me alone and to stop tormenting me. I heard what sounded like evil laughter, you know, like someone was giggling at my discomfort and feeble attempt to make it leave.

I've tried everything I can think of, and they keep coming back. I tried time and time again to find out if anything strange had happened in my home before we moved here, but found nothing. There's nothing that could be causing this unless they're drawn to me. None of this happened until one of my friends dared my to enter our local cemetery alone. I told them to leave me alone about it and they said, ""Sure, fine, whatever,"" and when I turned away from them, they pushed me over the wall and the next thing I knew, I was back on the outside of the gate and my friends were freaking out. I asked them what happened and they told me that the instant I was over the wall, I started screaming bloody murder then just collapsed.

I'm thinking that these shadow people have something to do with that incident, but I'm not sure. I'm scared and angry and wish that they would just go away. I don't know what to do and my mother won't believe anything I say. I showed her the scratches and she said it was the cat and refused to hear anything more.

Any advice would be welcome. I was willing to share my time and space with these entities, but now that they have turned a bit violent... I don't know, I just need help.

A Frightening Moment in Marysville,"California, United States",Ghost Hunting,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Ghost Hunting :: A Frightening Moment in Marysville

Y ou know, my life has become very surreal, I feel like I walk one half of my life in the paranormal and the other half in reality. What I am about to tell you, gave me chills up and down my spine. I will say, that I actually saw a ghost with my own naked eyes! But, let's start from the beginning. This was a very unusual weekend, to say the least. The date is Saturday, June 30, 2007. I was invited to Marysville by the soon-to-be paranormal investigation outfit called M.P.I. (Marysville Paranormal Investigations). Three women who are fascinated by the paranormal and are in the process of starting their very own paranormal investigation team. The team is made up of No Name #1, No Name #2 and her daughter No Name #1. No Name #1 an avid reader of my paranormal articles contacted me and told me that she lives in an old Victorian home with No Name #3 and possibly this home is haunted. I was welcome to come up and spend the night. The home was built in the 1930s. Before I left for Marysville, I was mowing my lawn with the help of my neighbor Rukesh Kumar. When I finished mowing my lawn, I got packed up and headed out, only to return to my home two more times, because I kept forgetting items that I might need for a stay-over in Marysville. The third time I returned, I was walking out of my house and a car kept slowly going past my house. The driver kept staring at me. I looked at the driver and said...""can I help you?"" The driver says...""are you Paul Dale Roberts?"" With a quizzical look upon my face, I said...""yes"". Come to find out, this guy, with 3 kids in his car has been reading my paranormal articles and he was in my city visiting his family, he is from Chico. He wanted to show his kids where a real ghost hunter lives. I thought to myself...""oh, oh, I better not publish my address in my articles, now I am becoming a tourist attraction...yikes!"" After talking with the driver for a while, I finally got in my vehicle and headed off for the final time towards Marysville and kept thinking...""I better not publish my address with my articles anymore, before I know it I will have some girl that I jilted back in my disco heydey stalking me..."" Thoughts of ""Play Misty for Me"" and ""Basic Instinct"" came to mind. Yep, my life has become surreal.

I arrive in Marysville and the house is like a mansion, it's very impressive. I meet No Name #1, #2 and #3. #1 prepares dinner for everyone, barbecue steak, tossed salad, baked potatoes, toasted French bread, watermelon, cantaloupe and we all eat on the balcony on this beautiful sunny day with the wind slightly blowing. #2, the manager of this home on in Marysville, tells me a story about the area that #1 lives in this mansion. At one time a tenant named D.H. Lived there. She was in her 40s and was taking a lot of prescription drugs for her diabetes. Mixing alcohol with prescription drugs, lead to her death. One day she collapsed and she was found dead by her care provider. According to #2, she was a very sweet lady. D.H. Enjoyed taking lots of baths, that is one of the ways she would pass time in this sleepy little town.

Before night would fall, #1 had to make a stop at the Western Union for her daughter and I drove her to the Western Union at K-Mart in Marysville. When leaving K-Mart, Marysville finest pulled me over. The officer looks at me and says...""did you know you were doing 43 in a 25 mph residential area?"" I looked at the officer and told him...""sir, I really didn't realize I was speeding and haven't been pulled over by the police since 1979..."" He checks me out and let's me go, that was a close one. All of Marysville is residential and I am not used to driving that slow, so I let #1 drive my car... The Ghost Tracker.

As #1 was driving my car, I have a flashback to the day in 1979, when I was pulled over. I had just got dancing 8 1/2 days disco dancing with a 5 minute break on every hour. Yes, I danced 205 hours and made it in Ripley's Believe it or Not and leaving the marathon, I was fatigued. The officers thought I had been drinking. One of the officers said I looked familiar, I told the officer...""well, you probably have seen me on TV, I am the Disco King of Sacramento and I just got done dancing 205 hours. The officer said...""do some dance moves"". So, here I am pulled over on a busy freeway and I turn up the music in my car and give the officers a dance show. The officer who asked me to dance, drops his flashlight and with his jaws agape says...""you can go"". Yes, I know, I have lived a strange life. Now back to my scouting mission in Marysville.

The sun finally sets and it's dark. I bring out my digital camera and start snapping away. I take a lot of pictures and there are no orbs, no mist or anything. Then I take a picture of #3 and there is a clear orb over her head, I snap another one and the orb moves to another location, still close to #3.

More pictures and in one photo, on the left hand side is a red orb approaching #3 on top of the steps. I take the 2nd picture and this huge red orb has now engulfed #3. I snap another picture and the orb is gone. Taking pictures down the steps, there is a red orb moving up the steps.

Now, here is where things got weird. As #1, #2 and #3 analyze my photographs with amazement, I am looking up the stairs and I actually see a human figure shadow with distinct head and torso moving from #1's loft to #3's loft. There is no one in those lofts, they are standing with me! I ask #1, #2 and #3 if they saw the shadow and they didn't. That is so frustrating, because I have no witnesses and I saw this human shadow with my own eyes! The chills go up and down my spine and I am totally SHOCKED! I will place my hand on a stack of bibles and swear to what I saw. I would swear what I saw in a court of law. Just before I saw this human shaped shadow move across the entry way between the two lofts, I was telling #1, #2, #3 that I have never witnessed anything with my own eyes or ears. Of course, there was Friday night where I thought I heard an old man's voice in the Folsom cemetery, but I am unsure of what I heard. I have only seen orbs through photographs or video, never with my own eyes. This is the first time I have seen with my own eyes, a human shadow and there was no human to make that shadow. I was astounded!

#3 says that she feels like she is being watched constantly. She just has that feeling of being watched. While we were doing our investigation, we heard strange sounds coming out of the attic and #2 suggested 'bats', but was unsure. Later on this evening, we all piled up in #2's car and she showed me the haunted historical Forbes House, I snapped a few pictures through the windows and didn't get anything. While she drove us around, I checked out the photographs on my camera, and I had taken a lot of pictures of the big red orb, a medium sized crystal orb and a tiny orb, I call the 'baby orb'. In fact one picture the red orb engulfs the baby orb. We stopped over at #2's home. #2's home is quite old too and she had me snap some pictures in her home and I captured 3 orbs on her ceiling where the family sits and watches TV. All of her other rooms were orb free. Robin tells me that Marysville is an old town and her former H Street House was very haunted, that the light in the closet would go off and on. The door of this home would swing back and forth. One time #2 was looking for something and she said out loud...""where is it?"" She heard a whisper, that replied ""it wasn't me..."" #2 said that one day she saw what appeared to be a small bodied person kneeling down in her home and then it was gone.

#2 also told me another ghost story, that her mother's home in Live Oak was haunted. When all of her family were in bed, the TV came on and the whole house lit up for a few minutes. The lights in this home would flicker off and on and #2 thinks to this day, it was probably her deceased father. #2 said, that the next time I come up, she will show me some of the old... Very old Marysville cemeteries that are reputed to be haunted. She feels Marysville is a paranormal hot zone. Lindsey was so excited after this investigation, she is purchasing her own digital audio recorder, digital camera to get M.P.I. Started with her mother #1 and friend #1.

I spent the night in this old home and nothing occurred, or I was so out of it, I didn't realize anything occurred. I left on Sunday and zipped over to Vacaville to meet another one of my readers, her name is Eubecita J. Bell aka Bebe. She sat and told me that when her husband passed away, that she saw his image zip past her and one night, she felt his presence on her bed and he was touching and rubbing her leg. After interviewing Eubecita, she didn't have anything that I could investigate in the present. She had a long story about the ghost of her deceased husband, but it was only a story and nothing I could hold onto and investigate. I knew at this time, it was time to go back home and hopefully I will not have any more out of town visitors patrolling my neighborhood looking for a real ghost hunter to show their kids.

There was one more thing, I would like to mention about this Maryville home investigation. Whenever the red orb was around, I had a hard time snapping the photo, my new batteries drained completely in the presence of the red orb and I had to make a store run to get fresh batteries.

Tiny Lights of Gold and Silver,British Indian Ocean Territory,Orbs / Lights / Mists,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Orbs / Lights / Mists :: Tiny Lights of Gold and Silver

I have told quite a few stories here on YGS. This short one is something I experienced recently and is something new to me. I have experienced or researched the paranormal for the past 26 years and thought I had seen or experienced it all. I was wrong. This was something that I had never seen, read or heard about in all that time.

A few weeks ago I had just returned to my room after a day of work and was looking forward to a nice quite evening. I went into my kitchen to get something to drink and I was immediately surrounded by tiny lights of gold and silver or what I have come to call fairy dust/lights. This lasted for no more than a few seconds then they disappeared. Truthfully I thought I was just seeing things.

That is until it happened a second time. About a week after the first incident I had returned to my room after being out beach combing and I was getting ready for a shower when it happened again. I was completely surrounded by these tiny lights. They lasted for about a minute and then they were gone. I did not feel afraid or apprehensive of these tiny lights, just curious as to where they came from and what they could be.

I searched my room for anything that could possibly explain what it was I was seeing. I could find nothing. I have tried to research what these tiny lights could have been, but unfortunately I haven't been able to come up with anything as of yet. I will keep you all informed if I am able to locate any info on these lights or if anything new happens.

Mother Like Daugter,"New York, United States",Apparitions / Voices / Touches,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Apparitions / Voices / Touches :: Mother Like Daugter

T his is a story about when I was only about 8 and my cousin was about 9. She lived in N.Y at this moment in a visible but low key neighborhood. It all took place in a two story condominium (small), I was taken to her house one morning to spend the night with her, but our parents had to leave us soon after to do some errands for a while. So we were all alone in her apartment.

I didn't think anything of it at the moment, we then decided to go to her older brother's room to play with some video games until our parents were to return. Then me and my cousin were automatically stopped by the sight of a mother holding the hand of a little girl, wearing all white, heading towards us with the simplest look on their faces. We were not able to move, we were frozen where we stood.

About 10 seconds later, we ran back into her room and locked the doors. We spoke and told each other that what we saw was real. It was actually a older woman and a little girl that we say was her daughter. It was so frightening. We could not believe what had happened but we knew that was the only explanation we had. That was the day we never forgot about.

Did it have a meaning? Was the little girl trying to say something? Was she sticking her hand out for a reason? That day was unforgettable. We tried speaking to our parents. As you would think they did not believe a nine year neither an eight. But was it just our minds playing tricks? I think not, it was a real experience.

Some Things a Child Should Never Do,United Kingdom,Misc,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Misc :: Some Things a Child Should Never Do

B loody Mary... I played that during a lock-in at my elementary school just for the fifth graders of course, as it was celebrating our time almost being up in elementary school (a lock-in, is a large, supervised slumber party, basically). Well, now I don't know if it WAS Bloody Mary, but something definitely happened. So much so that one of my friends was scared so much, that her parents had to home school her. Well, my two friends and I were bored, and so we started telling scary stories. I can't remember the exact time, but I think it was around eleven thirty. All of the kids (there were about forty of us) were piled into the cafeteria/gymnasium (it was one huge shared part of the building)... and we were bored.

One of my friends, Monique, told us about Bloody Mary, and how if you said her name three times in a dark bathroom, looking at the mirror, and have the taps running at full... she'd appear in the mirror. Monique told us that if you could stare her down, she'd grant you a wish. So the three of us hopped up, got a chaperone to escort us to the bathroom, and off we went. The guy chaperone stayed outside, and we went in.

On getting in, my other friend Shannon and I got too scared, and said nevermind, so we both went into the stalls to use them, leaving Monique out by the sinks (and the three HUGE mirrors behind them). Midway through 'going', all the taps turned on and then the lights turned off! I couldn't believe Monique was going to do it! I heard Shannon shout ""NO!"", and we both got out of the stalls around the same time, just as Monique was saying Bloody Mary for the third time. What I saw next gave me nightmares for about 5 years.

Through the moonlight (and light posts) coming through the window to my right, I could see the water coming out of the taps didn't look right. Not daring to look in the mirror, I approached to see that the water looked black. I put my hand under one, and the water was luke warm and thick. I looked over at Shannon, who was staring hard at Monique. Monique had this odd look on her face, with her mouth in an 'o' shape. Before I knew what was happening, the mirror directly in front of Monique cracked, and shattered onto the floor...

Monique had a piece of the mirror in her hand (although I never saw her bend down to pick up a piece), and was dragging it across her wrist... And the same black stuff that was coming out of the taps started to leak from her wound (blood from the taps... Blood from her wrist). I couldn't help myself, I was frozen to the spot.

Finally, Shannon seemed to break free of the spell she'd fallen under, screamed, and the male chaperone flew into the room, flipped the lights on, and as soon as the lights came back on, it was as if nothing happened. The taps were off, the mirror was unbroken...

But Monique was still bleeding from the wrist, and I still had blood on my hand from the tap. I quickly moved to the sink to wash it off (thankfully the chaperone didn't notice my hand, otherwise I think I would have been blamed for Monique's injury), and watched as Shannon just shook her head no, as if she were trying to shake out the sights she had just seen.

The man saw to Monique, who hadn't cut herself too deeply, so he bandaged it. Monique told him that the lights went off and she tripped. Shannon said nothing. I said I didn't know what happened, just that the lights went off while I was going pee. I knew that I hadn't imagined it, because I could see in the other two's eyes that they knew exactly what happened.

Monique's parents were called, and they took her home. Shannon didn't speak to me for the rest of the night, and I just ended up trying to sleep. But I couldn't forget what I'd seen, it kept replaying every time I closed my eyes. Shannon went home the next day... And didn't come back to school.

When I asked about her, the teachers told me she was being home schooled, and wouldn't be back. One day while out shopping, I saw her parents, whom I knew, and when I approached them and said hello, they blanked me, and walked off. Monique never spoke about that night, and we drifted apart. I remember one day I tried to talk to her about it, and she told me I was crazy, and that I didn't know what I was talking about. She actually threatened to beat me up if I mentioned it again.

I'll never know what it was that she saw in that mirror, or be able to explain what I saw happen, when the physical evidence after the fact seemed to prove my observations false. I swear this is true, and even though I don't know if it was Bloody Mary, or just an evil presence who saw it's opportunity to strike at three innocent girls (which could very well be, as it was a Department of Defense school in the UK, and on a USAF base which used to belong to the RAF, and had played a pivotal role in WW2), I just wanted to share this experience...I'll never forget it.

My Two Ghost Stories,United Kingdom,Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: My Two Ghost Stories

I do not know how to start, but here I go. My cat Fuzz Buzz died on my bed when I was sleeping. When I got up I saw that he had died in his sleep. Sometimes I still see him, but I have not told mum that I can. When I go to bed he is always with me, and I feel him go on my chest. I do wish he could come back to be alive with me. He was with me 14 years. I am now 15. I think he is guarding me when I sleep at night.

My mum told me when she was a little girl she had seen a ghost. I will tell you what she had told me. She was about 13 when this had happened to her. She was in her bed, just lying there, and it was nice and warm. It was dark, and she had her arm out. She thought that she heard someone came up the stairs, so she called out.

No one answered her, and she laid there. She thought she heard the someone came into her room, but there was no one there. She felt someone touch her arm, and when this happened, she went ice cold. It was not flesh to flesh. She got up to turn the light on, and the door was shut. No one was there, but she felt that it was a man.

This happened every night. He sat on the end of the bed and talked to her. She found out some time later that the man had died in that room in his bed. Her mum heard her talking to someone. She came in the room and asked who was she talking to, and she said, ""A man"" but her mum did not believe her.

When the little girl got older and moved out, she found that the man was talking to her brother. Then her mum believed that there was a ghost in the house. It sounds creepy but cool at the same time.

Poltergeist at my Sisters,"Iowa, United States",Psychic / Medium,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Psychic / Medium :: Poltergeist at my Sisters

T his story isn't about me. This happened to my sister, Stef and her husband, Pat, and is still going on. I am terribly afraid for both of them. My brother-in-law has an ability to see and talk to those not with us anymore. Because of this he gets a lot of unwanted visitors. This latest one is the strongest entity they have encountered.

On the night of June 21st, 2007, Stefanie woke up from Pat hitting her. She looks over and he's dead asleep. She hears a knocking on the front door as well as their dog, Shyla. She was barking extremely loud and not once did Pat wake up. After she got Shyla calmed down, she started to doze off but felt a very strong presence and flung her eyes open. She got up and lit a candle but this time it didn't work. Stefanie climbed over Pat and lit another candle and he still didn't wake up like he always does.

She laid back down and heard a noise that sounded like someone stomped in the living room and Shyla started to bark again. And again Pat did not hear her, dead asleep. She shook him to wake him up. He noticed the distress in her voice as she told him that something was outside their bedroom. They opened the door and let Shyla out. When they did, she had the biggest razor back and deepest growl they've seen. Shyla ran around the house searching everywhere because she knew something was there. They went back to the bedroom and it felt extremely uncomfortable. Pat started to see 2 angels in front of him guarding him from he explains as a dark red mist. They had 3 candles lit and started praying their hearts out. It went away and they were finally able to fall asleep.

These are the types of things that my brother Pat has to deal with almost on a daily basis. After this incident, they went to go see a psychic. This wasn't the first time they've seen him so he knows about Pat's abilities. He had told Pat that what he has is a poltergeist that has attached himself to his right arm. In most of Pat's past lives, he was born into evil. At one time he was a samurai that was sent to look over a village but something went bad and he went on a killing rampage. This poltergeist is someone from his past in which he had a contract with and still thinks that they have that contract. They were told that during the day, it'll sit in the living room and then come to their bedroom at night. The poltergeist told the psychic that the white candles only angered him. Now they burn black candles, burn white dried sage, and tell him that the contract is over and that he needs to go away.

They live in Kentucky because he's in the Army. This last weekend, he came up here to Iowa to visit while Stef stayed home. She told us yesterday that the poltergeist stayed and bothered her all weekend. Making noises all over the house. She woke up Sunday morning with a scratch on her back side. They were told that once they get it off of Pat, that he needs to close the hole in his arm. I am worried that this poltergeist may end up hurting them more than what it already has.

Does anyone have any advice that could help them get rid of it? And how to close the hole in his arm once it's gone?

Granny's Rose,"Florida, United States",Children Who See Spirits,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Children Who See Spirits :: Granny's Rose

I n 2001, my little cousin, Kayla, was three years old. She was not told when our great grandmother, whom she had not seen since she was an infant, passed away. Kayla was not informed about, nor was she present at the funeral. She's always had something strange about her... I'm not sure how else to describe it, but she's always seemed very wise beyond her years. She remembers things that you wouldn't expect her to remember, and she seems to understand things, very deeply, that you wouldn't expect her to.

After Kayla's mother had returned home from the funeral, she sat on the couch, looking at a rose. She had taken this rose from off the casket at the funeral, as a way to remember her grandmother. Kayla walked into the room, and asked her mother for the rose.

Kayla's mother and my own mother are sisters, and their mother, who we both address as, ""Granny,"" is very close with us. She still baby sits Kayla almost every weekday after school. So, of course, my aunt made the assumption that Kayla was talking about her.

Kayla very firmly corrected her mother. ""Not MY Granny. YOUR Granny...""

This pretty much freaked my aunt out. She was shaken enough to hand Kayla the rose.

I've noticed that many of the stories on this site happen to people when they are very young, or they happen to the elderly, when they are very close to death.

Does a closeness to birth or death really allow a person a stronger ability to see the other realm? Or are children just impressionable, so they believe anything they think they see? I would imagine this is true in some cases, but at the same time, how would Kayla have known that the rose her mother held belonged to her great grandmother?

Hearing and Seeing Strange Things that Dogs also Notice,Canada,Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: Hearing and Seeing Strange Things that Dogs also Notice

O ne evening when I was about 14 or 15 years old, I was doing what I normally would do when my parents went out for dinner with one another and left me at home to watch the dogs. We had two dogs, both toy poodles, which are commonly known as being noisy and annoying. Not these little guys, they were so very calm for most of their lives and only barked when something unknown to them was approaching.

I was on the computer, and talking on the phone with a friend up in Sylvan Lake whom I hadn't spoke to in a while and during the conversation, I heard something smash like glass breaking in the room I was in - this was actually while my parents were still at home. I put the phone down and ran upstairs to make sure my mother was okay in the kitchen as she had rheumatoid arthritis and fell and tripped quite easily and was unable to prevent her falls without seriously hurting herself.

he asked me what I had broken as she heard the glass shatter too - which made sense as the noise I had heard had come from the living room that I was in at the time. Even the guy on the phone had heard it, I remember him asking me what had just happened. ""I don't know,"" this was when I put the phone down and checked with Ma. Nothing broken was found, no glass - nothing.

A couple of hours later, they went for their dinner. I was in the living room with the dogs, and I have always had a slight fear of being in such a big house by myself with so many lights out. But I was usually fine if I just closed the french doors to the living room and hung out in one spot and kept myself occupied. I was laying on the couch with the dogs cuddled next to me, when I heard something like feet moving from outside the french doors to the living room. The dogs heads both perked up to the sound of this, and this bothered me - as I was hoping it was my imagination. I still tried to convince myself of this until both of the dogs actually got up and started to sniff the underneath of the door as they were convinced something was out there.

I heard a small whimper, almost like a child whimpering. I quickly got up to move the dogs and open the door, but I could see something actually SITTING outside of the door, and almost like a white shirt. Reminding me of an infant, I panicked and couldn't bring myself to open the door at all. I called my parents to let my mother know I was freaking out and to come home right away, and they did. ""We'll be about 15 minutes, just let us get things squared away here and I'll be right there, hun. It's just the dark playing tricks on you..."" ""Yeah, but Mom - you always told me that if the dogs couldn't notice it, it wasn't there, right?"" ""Right..."" ""They're at the &@#$ing door sniffing and whimpering, Chico's barking..."" and then the dog barked, and my Mom said she'd be right there and hung up the phone.

Not even 15 minutes later my parents showed up, but as they were opening the garage door, all of the lights in the house turned on... This was before they were actually IN the house. I immediately started crying, ran to the comfort of my mother's arms, and haven't experienced anything like that since. ALTHOUGH - just shortly before my mother passed away when I was 18, she finally confessed to me that strange things were going on in our laundry room.

The dryer door would always end up being opened, and this was a brand new dryer, the thing locked itself when it started quite tight. You had to yank on it to pry it open mid-dry cycle. I remember this now as she used to come stomping down the stairs, run into the living room, scream at me for opening the dryer door, and would wander away. I never thought much of it because I just figured my mother was kooky and strange, and she was, but - heh, little did I know she was experiencing some spookiness herself.

We had a laugh over it, and then didn't experience much else after that until she died. She hung around the house for a while - every morning at 6:30 AM (which was when she woke up) you could still hear her shuffle into the kitchen from her bedroom with her slippers, opening cupboard doors to make her morning Tea. This occurred for about 6 months after she died. I took comfort in it, as I had thought it was just my mind playing tricks and missing memories, until two of my friends woke me up on different occasions to express their fear about the shuffling noise as if someone was walking around upstairs and hanging out in the kitchen.

For once something like that didn't scare me, and all I said was ""don't worry, it's just Mom"" and rolled over and went back to sleep.

I am curious to know if anyone might have any idea as to why these occurrences have happened. Please share your ideas.

House Next Door,Canada,Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: House Next Door

M y neighborhood is a nice neighborhood, almost all the houses look the same, depending on what end of the street your coming from. We have nice huge houses, to small ones, and ones with brick / stone or brick and wood. However, in 2003, movers moved this All wooden cottage looking house to the neighborhood... Which happened to be placed on the empty lot next to my house.

The lady living there wasn't nice, especially to her dogs. (They looked like they haven't been fed in days. Sad to look at) She'd threaten people for commenting on her house, and even called by-law about our Bug Sapper being to noisy. I think she was getting back at us for calling by-law about her dogs being in my yard.

She wasn't living there much longer with her sons / dogs. A year or two later she moved. A couple months of the house being empty, the house was creepy looking, the yard wasn't taken care off, the balcony looking like it was going to collapse, the door looked like it was going to fall inwards if you knocked on it. The wood on the house was white and rotten looking.

Before the relative came to buy the house and fix it up, every time I walked by it, I didn't like the feeling of that house. Even today, after my neighbor, the nice relative instead of the meany neighbor, fixed it up... I still don't like the feeling. At first, when I walk by there, I always felt like I was being watched, still do at times, but that's only on a rare occasion.

From the time she left her house to the time the guy came to fix it up, no lights were on, and every time I'd walked by, a heavy breeze would happen, even on a hot humid day, where there wasn't any breeze. My laundry room window unfortunately faces the balcony of this house next door. I try to avoid looking at the window, when it first went in, I thought I'd seen someone just staring at me on the balcony.

I remember one night this month, the new neighbor wasn't home, and his lights were off. I was doing laundry at night, and it just felt like someone was leaning on the balcony ledge, looking directly at me. I don't mind it when spirits are around ""watching"" but, when your doing laundry, couldn't they give you a little privacy? I did ask him politely to go watch another neighbor, not sure if that worked or not. At first, I was uneasy about it, now that I look back on it, I just sit back and laugh at it.

There is something with that house. It could have been just a bad vibe from that mean lady, or it could be something else. I'm happy that the relative took over the house, it looks better... Not suited for the neighborhood, but wish the spirit would mind its matters.

Encounter of the Floured Kind,"Texas, United States",Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: Encounter of the Floured Kind

W hen I was fifteen years old, my parents and I moved into a house near my high school in an older neighborhood. A few months after moving in, my parents went out of town and left me home with my friend Tori. Tori and I were watching t.v. In the main living room which is open to the kitchen. Suddenly, we heard WHAP! WHAP! WHAP! WHAP! From the kitchen in all directions. We got up and peered through the large opening from the living room to the kitchen. The first thing we noticed was that a bag of flour tortillas was lying on the ground. As we moved further in, we saw that the white bread and home-made biscuits were also on the ground and on the other side of the kitchen island was a box of crackers. It was as if someone had thrown all of the flour products on the flour in rapid succession. Nothing else on the counters was disturbed or even out of place.

Another incident in the same house was when my mom and I were alone one night. I was in my room reading a book for school and my mom was in the shower with the door locked. Suddenly, I hear my mom fly out of the bathroom in a panic yelling ""Rachel WHAT'S WRONG"". I looked up and she's standing in my bedroom doorway with a wild look in her eyes. She then told me that she was just getting out of the shower when she heard a voice screaming ""MOOOOOOOM!"" At the top of its lungs. She admits it didn't really sound like me but that we were the only ones home.

A month after that, I was walking by my dad's study when I saw a man in a white t-shirt, jeans, and work boots as clear as day out of the corner of my eye. However, I was in such a hurry that by the time I realized what I saw and stopped my stride, I had already passed the doorway. When I went back there was no one there. This was no surprise because I was the only one home. Or at least I thought I was.

What or who are these things and what can be done about them?

Kingda Ka Ride Has a Ghost,"New Jersey, United States",Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: Kingda Ka Ride Has a Ghost

I live in New York, I've seen many other encounters with ghosts there. If you haven't read my other stories then you won't know what I've seen or heard. This story I'm about to tell happened in the very famous amusement park ""Six Flags Great Adventure"" in New Jersey.

I went there on June 27th for camp. All my friends in my group wanted to go on Kingda Ka, the fastest roller coaster on Earth. I was going to try it, but by the time we got up there, I chickened out. Five out of the seven kids in my group went, my counselor didn't go either. When two kids were on line, there were three in the carts all strapped up and ready to go (I was standing behind the gate by the exit on the other side, wishing them good luck).

One of my friends asked a kid in my group if they can sit next to them because there was another opened seat. They said sure. But when she sat down, she couldn't, something or someone was blocking her. So she just said she'll go when they get off. My friend wasn't even paying attention when this was happening, but I saw it happen. The chair pulled down the seat on it's own and strapped itself in! My friend sitting next to the ""Automated"" chair always screams really loud! She can't make herself stop, it sort of ruins the fun of the ride (no offense).

When the guy came around to check if everyone was good, he made a weird looking face at the chair that already was buckled. But he set the train off anyway. There they go, 150 feet into the air. Pretty high, but it's so fast you don't really notice how high you were. I was at the bottom and I can hear my friend screaming at the top of her lungs. When they made it back and got out I asked ""How was it?"" My friends said ""AWESOME!"" Before we left we had to remember to wait for the other two kids in my group. Now when they got in, the chair that had no one in it before was still there. Locked in. I watched it.

I took out my phone to see if there was anyone there, because if it was a ghost, it would come up on the camera. I turned to camera mode. My jaw dropped to the site. I couldn't even show my friends or take a picture I was so shocked. There, sitting in the seat, was a almost about 16 year old boy wearing a park uniform. I looked at him. He had his arms folded and looked pretty mad. I think he didn't enjoy his ride with my friend screaming at the tippy top on the roller coaster. I saw him get up, open the gate, walk right past me, up to the controls and press a button. The people working there said after awhile that the computer wouldn't make the trains go because it thinks that 3 seats aren't locked in even though they were. The ghost ruined everything for my friend, but at least when we walked past the ride again, it was working and they went on it again.

Now you would think that I would never see that 16 year old ghost again right? Wrong. The second time we went to Kingda Ka, I saw him sitting on the roof of where the trains were. My counselor went to the bathroom so no one saw me do this. Just like my name ""GhostTalker13"", I talk to ghosts. So I called the dude down, still holding my phone of course. So he came down and I told him to sit next to me and talk before my counselor got back from the bathroom. He said his name was Ricky. He used to work here 2 years ago. One day, when they were finally going to test Kingda Ka for the first time, no one wanted to do it. But he was brave enough to raise his hand and try it. He sat in that same seat he was sitting in before when I first saw him. And the people got it ready, he made the ready sign with his hand and off he went.

Everything was going as planned, except when it got to the top. It didn't have enough speed the train, so when it got to the top, it stopped. Then it rolled backwards really fast like 365 miles per hour with Ricky on it! When it got back to the station, the workers found Ricky dead. They had a burial for him, but he said that he just wanted to make sure everything is ok now with the ride so the whole rolling backwards thing doesn't happen again. He also told me why he played around with the computer before, he said he was so mad at the girl sitting next to him screaming! I told him that was my friend and she always does that. He said, it's ok now. So then he went back on Kingda Ka, and never saw him again.

If you haven't been to this amusement park, you're missing out on a lot of stuff. Also, before you enter Kingda Ka, there's a sign that says this:

""On occasion, Kingda Ka's train will not go over the hill. This is a Normal Occurrence. If it doesn't, it will safely go back down the hill slowly and stop in it's starting place and be ready to be launched again.""

Erotic Dreams and a Force Pinning Me Down,"Missouri, United States",Succubus / Incubus / Sexual Ghosts,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Succubus / Incubus / Sexual Ghosts :: Erotic Dreams and a Force Pinning Me Down

I 've been having strange, almost violent, erotic dreams every night that don't feel natural to me. Before I didn't ever get these dreams or maybe once every couple of months. Lately, it's been every morning and I wake up feeling violated.

This morning I had another, but this time it was different. It was like I was viewing with someone on a computer or projection screen. Then, I heard talking next to me. I don't remember what was said though. I remember becoming aware of what I was seeing and starting walking away from it in my dream, trying to consciously change the images.

I was half awake and almost coming out of my dream state when I heard a faint whisper say my name. It was a male whisper. Then, it got louder. I remember thinking, I'm almost awake and aware of a spirit saying my name. So, I said, ""yes?"". Immediately, there was a force above me, heavy on my chest. There was a rock or force in my throat. All I could do was wiggle my head and it stopped.

This really scared me, but now I'm confirmed that I feel somewhat aware of something there every morning after my fiance leaves for work.

I live in an old apartment with my 9 month old son an I've been curious about the energy here because he wakes up sometimes screaming like he was attacked. I worry for him more then myself because he's just a baby.

Interacting with Dark Figures in a Room,Canada,Misc,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Misc :: Interacting with Dark Figures in a Room

H ey guys, just a little story of what's currently going on with me. A few months ago I was in a dark room and there were a bunch of figures and they were all moving in this weird sequence, kind of all move, stop, move again, stop... It was weird, I was out of the room fast. The second time I was laying in my bed and I began to see dark figures in my room, I was initially freaked out by it so I just laid there and closed my eyes, after a few minutes I opened my eyes and the figures were still there. I was totally freaked but as time passed, a few minutes, I began to relax and just tried to figure it out because I am a very logical person and I was all like ""stop being silly, you're imagining things"", so as I laid there I decided to move and try to interact with the figures and they began to interact with me.

It was so weird, it seemed like the figures were made up of a type of black mist, kind of like the shadows, like it actually had substance to them because I would put out my hands and the dark would kind of engulf my hand and it would be cold and if I stayed still, it would kind of engulf me but it would not really do anything just kind of wrap around me. And if I tried to cup it with my hands, it was like smoke kind of just flow away. And the figures were like people, no distinguishing features, but they would hunch up on my bed and crawl around and stuff... I eventually fell asleep.

The last time this happened was last week, I was staying at my boyfriend's and we went to bed and there were figures in his room, he was passed out and one was on his chest, there were 2 more by me, kind of crouched up on his bed above my head, and they were making out and once they saw I could see them, they kind of interacted with me. One seemed like a girl and she would crouch down and put her face in front of mine and I could make her out, she was all dark but I could make out slight features, like nose and eyes. But then she would go back to making out with other dark figure it was so strange...

I was not sure exactly what was going on or what the interaction meant but after 15 min I was like ""well I can't stay up all night"" so I rolled over and went to sleep. I rolled over on my stomach as I was on my back initially, and when I did that I fell asleep once again, it was so weird. I really don't know what this means, it's really weird but I am not really scared of it anymore, it still freaks me out but after a few minutes, I just want to figure it out. Something else I noticed with the figures I see is they move in repetitive movements, whenever I see one or kind of interact with them, if I put out my hand, they will put out theres, retract it put it out again, all really fast. And also, once they see that I can see them, they constantly tap my face in my eye area and I can actually feel it, it does not hurt but it's like pressure and when they do this, it's the same repetetive movement.

I guess if anyone else has ever experienced this please leaver a comment or email me: contactdancarter [at] gmail.com, I am really trying to figure it out.

Buxton Inn Experience,"Ohio, United States",Ghost Tours & Haunted Hotels,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Ghost Tours & Haunted Hotels :: Buxton Inn Experience

I recently returned from a trip to Ohio to visit relatives. One of our day trips was to Granville, Ohio where we lunched, walked around, and visited the Buxton Inn which is supposed to be haunted. We were a large group of 10 and we were all looking forward to seeing the Inn.

When we walked in, we all went our separate ways to explore the many rooms. The Inn was busy with visitors and people having lunch. I walked around the gift shop, and the dining rooms, then decided to go downstairs to the Tavern. I walked down the steep set of stairs which led to the middle of the Tavern. I was the only person down there and I stood at the bottom of the stairs taking in the room and its history. I imagined all the people who must have had a drink there through the ages.

Then, all of a sudden, I felt extremely nauseous and faint. My heart was pounding and I broke out into a cold sweat. I climbed the stairs and sat down on the bench in the entryway and within a few minutes I felt fine. I turned to my husband and told him that I thought I had just had a paranormal experience.

I can't explain what happened to me. I wasn't sick from my lunch, I wasn't feeling anxious or afraid. I remember walking through the front door of the Inn and just feeling open to whatever was there. This feeling that I experienced just swept over me and was gone as fast as it came.

My question is: has anyone had an experience like this one? Is it paranormal? Is it a ghost passing through me?

Be Quiet!,Mexico,Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: Be Quiet!

T his encounter happened a few weeks after our first one . My brother william had gone out with friends and my parents were at work so I was alone. I didn't mind it very much. It was getting late so I decided to make myself food and watch tv. While I was watching tv, I heard one of the bedroom doors slam. I had thought it was Will, so I had ignored it.

About fifteen minutes passed and I heard a door slam and lots of chattering. I was trying to watch the show and the noise bothered me so I yelled, ""Shut up!"" It stopped for a while and then something got thrown. I thought maybe Will was playing soccer in his room again and I turned up the volume. As soon as the volume reached 54, Will came through the door. ""Turn it down you can hear it from far away..."" I turned off the tv, and noticed that he had been out the whole time. But as I was going downstairs, a book had evidently made its way to the bottom of the staircase. I noticed that the book didn't belong to me and that I had never seen it. I picked it up and William saw that I had it. He grabbed it out of my hand, ""Why are you touching my stuff?"" I replied, ""I'm not, it was on the floor here, someone threw it while I was watching tv..."" He gave me a look of disbelief.

After about three weeks William also started to hear chattering, the same chattering that I had heard. Will called me and I ran upstairs to see where it was coming from but it just faded away. I suppose it was coming from Will's room because he said that he heard moving in his closet and someone talking. We made my mom check the closet more than ten times, and we still couldn't find anything.

For at least a week Will slept in my room because he said people were talking in his room. Even now, you can sometimes hear the voices but we don't really know where it is coming from. The only thing that I don't understand is why the book was thrown down the stairs. I guess because the person wanted me to be quiet too. I don't even know.

My Brother Passed,Australia,Family / Friends Visits,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Family / Friends Visits :: My Brother Passed

M y brother (andy) and I have been with each other our whole lives, we've spend cold homeless nights together and we always looked out for each other. He'd said to me that he will always be with me, no matter what. As he passed away, I broke down and was very fragile. I had kept seeing him, hearing his voice, feeling sudden cold wind when no trees were blowing. I thought I was insane; I still do.

In my dreams he was there sitting in a dark empty room in a puddle of blood, singing the song our mum would sing to us at nighttime. I could make no sense of this. This dream was reoccurring for weeks, every time slightly different. Each time he would look a little older. I have no idea what this means. If it means anything.

Well one night, I was walking down our long hallway and by this point when I saw Andy, I would ignore it, I would look away. I was crying walking down the hall, he was standing motionless staring at me in the middle of the hallway. I looked at my feet and kept walking, as I bumped into something; it stopped me in my tracks, I felt myself running into a person. My brother. But he wasn't there. I could feel the warmth of his body. Maybe I truly am insane. That was the only time it happened. Moments later I got a phone call saying that my uncle had died in a motorcycle accident.

None of this makes sense to me... Not at all. There is more to this but it's just stupid.

Weird Thing Happening in my House 2,"North Carolina, United States",Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: Weird Thing Happening in my House 2

M y name is Rosa. I already wrote a story about what had been happening in my house. Well lately now, my sister says that she hears someone opening and shutting the door in the bathroom. I thought she was lying, but then I saw her face. She was scared and I never seen her like that. She usually plays pranks on me, so I didn't listen to her. I think it's that lady that appeared 2 years ago.

Yesterday, around 10PM, my family was in the living room watching TV, and I went to my bedroom. My little brother was with me but then he left to the living room to watch some TV. He said that he will be back. About 5 minutes later, I heard someone walk towards the bathroom, I thought it was my brother. But it sounded odd because I heard someone walk, then go to the restroom close the door and then nothing... I didn't hear nothing. Then I started calling his name and he didn't respond. About 2 minutes later, my brother went to the bedroom and asked him if he had went to the bathroom. He said No. I was like ok... (little freaked out). Also when I take a shower, I see shadows.

Well, almost every night, around 2AM, I feel like someone is moving the bed real slow but in a fast beat. I don't know how to explain but then I can't go back to sleep. One time I thought it was my little sister because she wanted to sleep with me, so I let her. Then I felt the bed moving and I told her to stop moving the bed, and she said that she's not moving the bed and that I'm freaking her out.

The Haunting,Canada,Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: The Haunting

T en years ago, when I was 19, I met a girl (Lyn) at a job placement agency, and quickly became friends. Lyn lived with another girl at the time and continued to complain about her roommate and ended up leaving and coming to stay with me and my family. After a few weeks, we decided to get a place of our own, and quickly found a nice basement apartment. Lyn was into the occult, nothing major just tarot cards, burning candles, etc, which never bothered me.

About a month after we moved in, the landlord (Susan) came down to the basement one afternoon to do laundry and the three of us somehow got onto the topic of ghosts. Susan mentioned she thought the place was haunted by her deceased mother among others, but the thought of ghosts never really bothered me, maybe due to a slight disbelief.

Two weeks later at around 12am, Lyn came into my room and woke me up. ""There are ghosts in this place and they don't like you very much, so I would watch myself if I were you"" is what she said to me at the foot of my bed, then left. Slightly disturbed and confused by this strange announcement, I got and went into her room to find her fast asleep. At first I though maybe she was pretending to be asleep and it was a prank, or maybe I was crazy and imagined I heard her saying that, but the next morning when confronted she claimed she didn't remember saying that so I wrote it off as a weird dream.

Then about 3 weeks later, the two of us were watching TV at night before bed. I had to get up for work at 5am so I decided to go to bed early. Something woke me up at about 2am, not a person but ""something"" snapped me out of my sleep and I awoke to an overwhelming uneasy feeling of not being alone. I felt the need to get out of my bedroom, so I got up and went to the bathroom, but still uneasy, and not comfortable enough to return to bed, went into the living room to watch TV. About 10-15 minutes later, the living room suddenly got very cold and I felt a rush of wind passing my cheek, in my ear, like a window was open but all windows and doors were closed as it was the middle of winter. Then I began hearing an almost chattering or whispering in my ear and the whispering continued and was circling around me, almost taunting me. I was hearing voices but nothing was there and it got louder and kept circling around me. I started to panic. I kept saying stop unaware of what was happening to me, but scared to death! Was I hallucinating?

I was so scared I did the only thing I could think of, I prayed to god, and not being a religious person by any means I prayed something fierce. ""Please god make it stop, I'm scared. Please make it stop!"" when all of a sudden everything stopped. The chattering/whispering in my ears and all around me, the rushing of wind, whatever was causing this just suddenly stopped just as mysteriously as it begun and after it stopped, I had this sudden overwhelming sense of relief and I was actually able to get up and go to bed and fall asleep like what I just experienced never happened.

I woke up at 5am, rushed to get ready for work and rushed out of the apartment, relieved to be out of there and I ended up staying at my boyfriends, friends, parents place during the coming weeks, too scared to sleep in the apartment, and eventually ended up moved back home.

Evil Waitress Entity,Jamaica,Misc,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Misc :: Evil Waitress Entity

I 've been all around the world; I love to travel. Ever since I was a baby I have been traveling... (when I was 3, I encountered an entity in Belize). Just recently I went to Jamaica and encountered an entity on a cruise ship with my boyfriend.

My boyfriend and I decided to have dinner on a beautiful cruise ship, and spend a few days on it. He started to act funny during dinner, and me being able to see little things like clues to his behavior, started looking for some explanation.

After an hour or so, he started to act normal. We finished our dinner and called a waitress over for desert. My boyfriend started to act funny again, just after the waitress left our table to go get the deserts. When the waitress came back, my boyfriend started acting really mean. He rampaged back to our room. I was highly embarrassed and went after him a few minutes later after paying the waitress. When I got to our room, I found him DEAD. With a knife in his hand...

I noticed this: every time he acted funny and mean, that same exact waitress was around. I am devastated of his death, and did the best I could to find out if anything went wrong on that cruise ship years ago. I found out a waitress killed herself out of the blue, in that dining hall 6 months earlier. I found pictures of the scene and she died right next to a pole in the center of the hall- the same place where our table was. What I talked to an expert and she said the spirit of the waitress was an evil entity and she was ashamed in herself for committing suicide, so she wanted to get rid of that shamefulness by making my boyfriends soul take the shame too.

Laying in Bed,"New Jersey, United States",Old Hags / Night Attacks / Sleep Paralysis,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Old Hags / Night Attacks / Sleep Paralysis :: Laying in Bed

N ow I consider myself a sane person. What I am about to tell you is the God's honest truth that just happened to me at around 1:44 AM that is going to keep me up for the rest of the night. I was lying in bed just looking straight across the room when all of a sudden I heard the wind pick up. I swear to god I felt a strong breeze. I got freezing cold. Then it went black.

I became petrified. I felt a feeling that I can't explain. A presence. It felt as though someone was sitting on top of me. Resting on my stomach. I was able to think clearly and knew what was going on. I didn't panic because I felt that this thing didn't want to hurt me. It seemed gentle but made me feel uncomfortable and I asked it to leave. It did.

That's when I realized why I couldn't see because it was right in my face and as it left I could see a completely black shadow just vanish into thin air above me. As soon as I was able to move I jumped out of bed, turned on the light and prayed. I checked the thermostat and tried to make sense of the situation. But I couldn't, the thermostat read 80F. The more I think about it, the more it freaks me out. All I know is that it happened and it wasn't a dream.

I've had nightmares but they never made me feel uneasy to go back to sleep. I wish it were a dream.

Nightmares,Mexico,Misc,"A bout a year ago, my granny died. I had been sleeping in my dad's study while she slept in my room. When she died, we left the bed how is was and a month later, I started sleeping in my room again. The first night was ok, but when a week flew by, I started getting nightmares. I always saw the same man in my dreams, always. He was very clean and wore a suit. I never quite saw his face but he would seem to do very nasty things. The strange thing was only when I slept in MY room alone, I would get nightmares. I didn't tell anyone about it because I thought it was nothing.

Five months had passed and the nightmares got worse and worse. I could never seem to wake up from them. I would end up waking in the middle of the night and right when I woke up, my cat medusa would me immediately right by my bed side. I soon got the guts to tell my neighbor. I discussed it with her and I told her that I thought that the man in the suit was the devil. I was really scared to go to sleep that I started staying up.

One night I woke up and I felt a pain in my leg. There were three scratches on my upper thigh. I ignored it but I realized that I had to tell my mom or dad. I told my mom but she just said that it was all in my head. But the thing is that right before my grandma died, I had a nightmare. I finally decided to tell my dad, I told him everything except about the scratches on my upper thigh. He brought a blessed rosary and a dream catcher and put it above my bed. I stopped having nightmares for a awhile, about 9 months, then my cat medusa died and they came back. They weren't coming as often though and only every now and then. And when I do have nightmares, it's the same one over and over again.

My brother says its my conscience, I haven't really done anything bad. Im' very frightened sometimes about what's going to happen to me in my dream because it doesn't ever end, I usually wake up right before something happens to me.

Was it my Grandfather?,United Kingdom,Family / Friends Visits,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Family / Friends Visits :: Was it my Grandfather?

I was about fourteen at the time and it was a Saturday night. My sister, my mother, her partner and I had been out together to the cinema, then a restaurant. We usually did that on the weekend, I think my mum's partner was trying to impress us. After dropping us home, he went back to his own flat.

The rest of us went to bed, as it was quite late. My sister fell asleep immediately and I, as usual, was left awake, struggling to sleep - I've always had insomnia.

After a few hours, I got out of bed to go on one of my regular nightly wanderings, maybe get a snack, watch t.v, fall asleep on the sofa. I did this pretty often, the sofa always seemed more inviting then my bed. So, on my way past my mum's room, I noticed the door was ajar, so I thought I'd check she was asleep. The room wasn't too dark - there was a street lamp outside the window so I could see quite clearly. I saw my mum was curled up, asleep, right up by the wall. On the other side of the bed, however I saw a man, laying as if propped up by pillows, on top of the covers. As soon as I saw him, I jumped back behind the door, as the way he was facing suggested he was awake and looking directly at me.

I immediately assumed it was mum's boyfriend, as he looked about the same skinny build, rounded shoulders, same square face and wavy hair. I couldn't see the facial features that well, I didn't look for long enough.

I took another look, to make sure I was seeing right - I was sure that my mum's boyfriend had left, I heard him go. When I looked again, the man was still there, in the same position, but not giving away whether he had seen me or not. Again, I jumped back, and again I took another glance, to make sure it was definitely him. Who else could it be? It looked like him. But why was he laying like that? Sort of, half sitting up looking directly forwards.

Well, I just assumed that my mum had sneaked him back in somehow, and as I wasn't sure whether he was awake or not, I went back to bed. In my room, I looked out the window to see if I could see his car outside. I couldn't see it, so I thought he must of parked around the corner.

The next morning, I got up and told my sister about the night before. We both decided to confront them, and marched directly to my mum's room, where he was gone, and she was awake, in bed. We asked her about her boyfriend, and she was confused saying we'd seen him leave last night. Obviously we didn't believe her, and questioned her endlessly until she finally got angry and demanded to know why she would lie about him being there. It's not like we had a problem with him.

I told her what I saw and she was genuinely scared. At first she didn't believe me, but when she realized I was serious, we all got a bit scared as I repeated my story.  They asked the usual questions, could I have been dreaming - no, I didn't go to sleep - am I sure about what I saw - most definitely, was as clear as I could see my mum in the same bed, like a normal, solid person.

It was only a couple of days later, when I was thinking about it, that I took a bit more notice of the picture of my mum's dad, who had died when she was fourteen, on the shelf. Wavy hair, square face, kind of skinny, round shoulders...

My mum once went to a clairvoyant, just to see what it was like, about a year or so before I saw this. She was her father's favorite and had been most effected by his death. The clairvoyant told her that her dad was often with her, and liked to watch over her while she slept. Could it have been him that I saw?

I don't really believe in ghosts, but I know I didn't dream or imagine it. What else could it have been? I would be really interested to hear what other people think about my experience. My mum truly believes it was her dad, what do you think?

"Acorn, my Feline Ghost Alarm","Massachusetts, United States",Apparitions / Voices / Touches,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Apparitions / Voices / Touches :: Acorn, my Feline Ghost Alarm

E arly fall 2002, I was sleeping peacefully through the night. Dreaming about obscure and pointless drama. When the sound of something I can not easily describe in words (imagine a sound similar to an ambulance siren and a squirrel being crushed by a mac truck combined, with the volume up all the way) I, being a very light sleeper, and suffering from insomnia, woke up immediately. Standing, now fully awake, I entered the hall to investigate the sound which had quieted and become a series of erratic hissings. The noise was obviously coming from my cat Acorn. The puffy calico was stanced for a fight at the gate which separated the staircase from the hall way.

Following my little kitty's gaze I observed what appeared to be a large dog peering his head over the gate. Knowing full well that we had at the time, 4 dogs living in the house, I assumed it was one of them. The animals size had not even entered my mind. Acorn saw me and bolted into my bedroom. I turned and looked at her as she was now hidden behind the dresser, still hissing. Turning back to the stairs the dog was gone. My curiosity had now gotten up its courage and I realized that it had been a rather large dog.

Going downstairs to investigate I discovered that all 3 of our dogs were asleep, undisturbed by the commotion. My younger sister had been sleeping on the sofa and was now awake also.

""Was that your cat making that noise?"" she asked a little bewildered.

""yeah, there was a dog at the top of the stairs... Did Michelle's dog come out of her room at all?""

I figured it had to be him he was the largest and acorn hated him.

""No Michelle took him with her to Angela's..."", There was the answer to that question.

My sister looked at me and I back at her, neither of us knowing exactly what to say. ""Well I'm going back to bed..."" I turned and went back upstairs still a little confused about what had just happened.

In the back of my mind I knew that it had been a ghost dog or something else just a supernatural, but seeing no obvious answers to be found that night, I went back to bed.

The next day I was not surprised to find out that acorns antics had awoken more than just my sister and I, and my mother was quite displeased at the notion of a magical ghost dog throwing my cat into fits of feline hysteria. From that point on acorn was ordered to stay in my room at nights... And after all she'd been through, I think she was obliged to accommodate.

Anna Mills Killed in 1938... Dead Yet  Amongst Us Still,"Minnesota, United States",Ouija Board / Seances,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Ouija Board / Seances :: Anna Mills Killed in 1938... Dead Yet  Amongst Us Still

A couple of years ago, I ran across an old Ouija Board dated 1919. I remember how fascinated I was with an experience when I was about 10 with one, so I thought that this ""board game"" would be fun to fool around with again.

My son, when he was very young, told me about looking out his bed room window and seeing three ""glowing figures"" coming from the field toward his window one night. He also stated that they even entered his room and stood at the foot of his bed. He covered his head with the blankets thinking that they would go away, and when he uncovered his head, they were still there... Then they vanished. I attributed this to a ""bad dream"" at the time.

There is this old, beautiful house on my property, built in 1926; the builder also signed and dated his name in the rafters in the attic. ""Cool,"" I thought, that he took so much pride in his work (like an artist) to do such a thing.

Anyway, we were in this old house, working the Ouija thing and so forth. My son asked me to see if what he saw was real or not. We got an answer and a lot more! The two people who were at the board knew nothing about this; in fact, they did not know the name of the road we live on or anything else much about this neck of the woods.

I asked if there were any ghosts who wanted to speak (not at all taking any of this seriously). YES replied the board. ""Who are you?"" I asked.

As our guests worked the Ouija board. ""Why are you here?"" I asked, and the plachetted began to move quickly.

I DIED HERE ON THE MUNGER SHAW ROAD. (Our guests didn't even know the name of this road.)

At this point, I was having fun with this game. I did not at all take this seriously; after all, this thing is just a game. ""So if this is all true, where is your body so that I can bring you some flowers?"" I jokingly asked. Her answer sent chills down my spine.

SKATTERED (misspelled by an 8 year old), she said. MY AHSES ARE SKATTERED WHERE YOUR TRAILER HOUSE IS, she added.

She gave us a lot of information that night. She is with two uncles who are elusive, but protecting her. She was visiting them here when her death occurred. Things have happened after that as well than before. When I first put the trailer house where it is (now abandoned, for I am now living in the old house), my ex-wife and I heard the distinctive voice of a child crying - that I can say without a doubt. My ex also told me that she saw a small girl one night fleeing out the door one late night (blew her off). And so did I one night when I woke up to use the bathroom, you know, through the corner of the eye, I attributed this to late night-half asleep stuff.

We did the Ouija again with two other people, again the same conversation with this Anna Mills. I cannot find any records of her existence of her anywhere, though. Then again, out here in the sticks (especially back in the '30s, records may have not been so critical; heck, I know a guy that have two people buried in his front yard from back then; that's in the days when they did things like that). I did ask her who her uncles were, and she remained allusive on that info.

Okay, I know this all sounds really weird, and I did not believe a thing about all of this until about a year ago...

I went for a walk, as I have quite often. I walked across the field on a winter moonlit night. On my way back, I distinctly saw two people ""sneaking"" around the trailer. Thinking that someone was trying to break in, I approached one of them. I yelled out to them, what did they want, ready to confront the intruders. I swear that I was within 15 feet of the guy wearing a plaid shirt and bib overalls when he took an abrupt right turn and went right through the wall of the trailer house - right below my son's old bedroom. I could see each and every detail of his face, and the texture of his clothes! He looked just like a real person - that would ""appear"" under a full-lit moon. I stopped dead in my tracks, but somehow I was not frightened out of my wits as one would suspect. Rather a comforting feeling came over me. By the way, when I first called out to them, the other ran into the woods.

All of this I merely attributed to suggestive thinking, thinking I saw things that I imagined and so forth. Perhaps it was a restless walk late at night and so forth.

About a month ago, I was visiting my sister and her family at their house miles away. Her daughter also had an old message board that her father found years ago in an attic of an old school that he once worked at. The planchette was missing, so for fun I went to work in his wood shop and made a really nice wood one for them. With her and her boyfriend at the board, I asked ""Anna are you here?""

This really freaked them out! ""Tell us the story that you told me the last time we spoke,"" I asked. Again, the same info that came up a year before. I did not reveal any of the prior things that Anna said to anyone there, but there it was, again the same. She said that I did see here once, and that she and her uncles did visit my son. I did not ask any of this, once the planchette began to move, she went on and on and on. I asked her if she liked what I did with the old house (it still looks as it did in the 30's-except for the addition of electricity and pluming, and she said that she feel at home. I asked her if she ever enters the house, and she said,

NO. BAD MEMMORYS. (Again misspelled by an eight year old girl.)

Lately, at night through the corner of an eye, my son as well as I have seen someone fleeting past the kitchen window. Even our dog sends an alert that somebody is here, when in fact there isn't. The last time I used the board (being a skeptic, I always have someone else use it) she said that she wanted to meet me along the edge of the field at one o'clock in the morning. ""Promise?"" I asked.

I never bothered. I'm not sure if I believe in such things, but it is fun to think about... Perhaps it is true!

UPDATE: 7-6-07...Anna is now ""haunting"" the people living in the trailer house now even though I have never shared this story with them. Denise and her friends have seen her as well. She still is alone and longing for what ever she is looking for. They are not afraid for they find her sweet and comforting. Just like the child she was in life, they have actually ""adopted"" her and she at times visits my old house and we chat with her on my antique Ouija board.

The Chained Oak,United Kingdom,Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: The Chained Oak

L iving in the UK, and a lover of theme parks, I am a frequent customer of a place in the midlands called Alton Towers. It's a HUGE amusement park, built on the grounds of an old stately home called... Alton Towers. A few years back, they opened a new attraction, a ride called Hex. All it is, is a bit of 'supernatural' history about the people who once lived at Alton Towers, and the curse that surrounded them... Mixed with a topsy-turvy assault on the senses (makes you think you're upside down, to eerie and LOUD music...). On going a few times after the attraction opened, my husband and I were very intrigued to find out more information about the story of the curse. The story goes like this:

""On an autumn night in 1821, The Earl of Shrewsbury was returning to his home, Alton Towers, when, mysteriously an old man appeared in the road.

The coach stopped to find why he was there, and the man begged for the charity of a coin.

The Earl cruelly dismissed him, so the old man placed a curse on him. The old man croaked: ""For every branch on the Old Oak Tree here that falls... a member of the Earl's family will die...""

But that night, a storm brewed up, and a single branch from the old oak tree broke and fell.

Later that very same night, a member of the Earl's family suddenly, and mysteriously died.

The next day, the Earl ordered his servants to chain every branch together to prevent other branches from falling...""

So, bearing in mind the legend, and determined to find the tree, we started asking people at the park if they knew where it was. One said that they weren't really supposed to say, because it's a bit off the beaten path, and it's on private property... Although it isn't on the site of the amusement park, it's actually near a Bed and Breakfast called 'The Chained Oak'. Making our way, myself, my husband, my brother-in-law, and his girlfriend, her friend, and her boyfriend, we set off to find the tree.

The day had been kind of off and on rain, but as we left the park to find the tree, it had cleared up, and the sun came out. We drove to the Bed and Breakfast, and they pointed us in the direction of the tree. They said be careful though... And we asked if it was because it was off the beaten path, and required a walk through some woods. The lady at reception just smirked, and said ""Yeah, something like that...""

We followed the path the lady sent us on, and sure enough, there in front of us, in a large clearing with stone steps leading up one side of the tree, was this ENORMOUS tree, with large heavy chains around the larger branches. As soon as we arrived, the rain was back, in thick drops, and quite hard, and the sky had gone particularly dark. We decided to make our trip to the tree short because we'd left all our umbrellas in the car, and the walk there wasn't a short one, so we couldn't just pop back to the cars to get them.

On closer inspection, the tree had actually grown AROUND the chains... Proving that it wasn't just a scam set up for curious people from Alton Towers, or the local town. We popped out our camera, and started taking some pictures of the tree, and us near the tree. I posed for a picture with my brother-in-laws girlfriend in one. Touching the tree, it had a vibration, and it was so WARM. The chains were strong, as my brother-in-law proved, by swinging himself off one, just to see if it held his weight.

The temperature had dropped significantly since we'd arrived in the clearing, and on discussion later, we all confirmed quite a ominous feeling while we were there. We had all described similar feelings, like the sense of being watched, the sense of being unwanted... But at the same time, a very calm feeling.

We had two cars, so my husband and myself got into ours, and the four of them piled into theirs, and we set off for our hotel. On the way there, I looked at the pictures on the digital cam, and was quite surprised at some of them. In the picture where I was posed with my brother-in-law's girlfriend, there was a dark spot in between us (we were shoulder to shoulder, and very close), like a missing part of the picture. Another interesting thing, was that although it had been dark and rainy while we were there, you can see in the pictures the SUN shining through the leaves of the tree. As far as I can remember, once back home and on a computer screen, there were quite a few orbs in the pictures as well.

I will check with my husband if we still have them, because shortly after the trip we had a large falling out with my brother-in-law, and my husband, being impulsive might have deleted some of them. I hope he didn't though, because I would love to share them with you.

Apparition at Time of Death,Australia,Family / Friends Visits,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Family / Friends Visits :: Apparition at Time of Death

T his story isn't mine, it is my great grandfather James', who told my grandfather, who told my father, who told me. My family on my father's side are devoted Christian's so I have no doubt that my great grandfather was telling the truth about what he believed he saw.

Due to this story having been told by word of mouth over four generations I am somewhat short on details but the general gist of the story is still the same.

I can't be sure of an exact location and date other than in James' house in Victoria in 1949.

Late one night, James got up to go to the toilet and in the hallway he claims to have seen an apparition of his father, Thomas, my great great grandfather. It was impossible for Thomas to have been there in person as he was over 90 years old and living in New South Wales.

Again, I am short on details so I cannot say for how long this apparition lasted or how James reacted and I can't give a detailed description of it other than that it looked like Thomas.

The following morning, a relative of James', a brother or sister (he had a lot) came to the door and told him that his father (Thomas) had died the previous night. To this James replied ""I know, I saw him last night, he died at ??? o'clock"".

Again, sorry I don't know what time he saw the apparition or the time of Thomas' death, so I don't know if the two events occurred at the same time.

Well that's the story, and just like my father before me, I'll be sure to pass it on to my children.

Voices in a DVD,United Kingdom,Apparitions / Voices / Touches,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Apparitions / Voices / Touches :: Voices in a DVD

I know that I have written a few stories in the past, but this one really freaked me out. Just three or four days ago I was going to sleep, when I heard the bathroom door open and shut, I thought it was my mum but it was late so I wondered what she was doing up.

I went downstairs to see what was going up, when I heard a voice wailing ""helllp meee please"", I woke my mum and she thought I was dreaming, as I have at least a dream a week about ghosts. I was terrified but went back to bed.

I turned my television on and started watching my two pints of lager DVD (I have watched this program tons of times so I know what happens) but something was wrong, the dvd menu kept flickering and I kept hearing a voice talking fast so I couldn't make out what it was saying.

I awoke my mum again and she told me to show her, she just said it was interference in the tv signal from another channel, when I told her it was a DVD, she admitted to hearing voices but since my room was in the loft, I must not have been able to hear it.

I haven't heard anything since, except strange noises coming from rooms in the house, I still don't watch that DVD anymore even though it's my favorite show and don't go out of my room at night unless it's absolutely necessary.

Blurred Face,"Ohio, United States",Apparitions / Voices / Touches,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Apparitions / Voices / Touches :: Blurred Face

I am Nancy from Ohio. One morning I woke up, I kept my head on my pillow. I got up and looked at the time, it was 5:20 A.M. I have two Dogs. My biggest dog laid on the bed with me and my smallest dog was downstairs. I keep my door slightly open. I could see out from where I was laying.

My dog perked up and looked out in the hallway. He just kept staring and staring out into the hallway. At that time I took my head off my pillow again and looked out. This time my dog started wagging his tail. Then I say what he saw. It was so clear except for its face. The face was blurry. It had on a red shirt and blue pair of jeans. It was tall. I was so scared I put my head down.

By that time it was 5:30. I finally got up when my dog stopped wagging his tail and staring. It was gone. I was scared to go back to sleep so I got up and went downstairs. My dog followed closely behind. I ate breakfast and watched some TV. Then all the sudden I heard this sound one the floor in the kitchen. It sounded like footsteps (I have a hard floor in the kitchen you can hear if anybody is in there. You can even hear my dogs.) I got up to look in the kitchen then they were gone.

I started reading ghost stories to help me and they helped a lot.

Ghosts Can Be Friends,"Colorado, United States",Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: Ghosts Can Be Friends

T wo years ago, my friend and I always talked about ghost stories and stuff that happened near our neighborhood. During school though, my friend found a messy note written on a napkin in her room. When she showed me, I didn't believe her. She got mad and wouldn't stop saying that she didn't do it, so I finally believed her. We couldn't read what they said because the handwriting was so messy, but we thought they had the word 'help' on there somewhere.

We started digging by the school tree just because it was hallow underground. A couple weeks later, I asked my other friend about it. She told me that there was this old farm thing across the street and that there were ghosts there. Soon, we gave up the dig. After more thinking, we figured out that those ghosts ended up following us to places! We decided to be their friends because they weren't harming us in any way, and hey, they had a ghost dog! There are also two sisters and a brother. I've seen the sisters, but not the brother yet. One sister is quiet and shy, the other is normal, the brother, I don't know, and the dog is so energetic and happy like any other dog! They've been my friends ever since! Yes, I've come across some scary and mysterious ghosts, but this is one experience I will never forget!

Something in my Bed,"West Virginia, United States",Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: Something in my Bed

M y ex-husband, Jamie, and I use to live with his dad. We were always told that this house was haunted. There have been numerous things happen to a number of different people. This is my story...

Every morning Jamie would get up to go to work and (our room was in the upstairs of the house) every morning, he would wake me up so I could go downstairs and get in bed with his sister (I was too afraid to sleep upstairs by myself because of all the stories I had heard). Before Jamie would leave for work, he would come into his sister's room and give me a kiss good-bye. I would have to raise my hand up to show him which side of the bed I was on. On this particular morning, everything went the way it always had. Jamie woke me up, I went downstairs and climbed in bed. He came in before he left, I raised my hand so he knew which side of the bed I was on. He gave me a kiss and left.

Later that morning, I woke up to see my sister-in-law standing at the foot of the bed, folding clothes. I noticed that her side of the bed was made. I asked her why she didn't wait for me to get out of bed so that she could make the whole bed at once. She said that the bed was made from the night before because she didn't sleep there that night. She had slept with her dad because she was scared. I thought she was joking around with me or playing some kind of trick. However, her dad confirmed that she slept in his room all night. I told them that someone had to be in the bed with me. I know this because our feet even touched and Jamie had me raise my hand to show which side I was on.

When Jamie got home that night I told him about what had happened. We still to this day, do not know who or what was in bed with me, but we do know someone or something was there.

Fright Nights,"North Carolina, United States",Psychic / Medium,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Psychic / Medium :: Fright Nights

Y ears ago in the late 70's, on the outskirts of Rocky Mount NC. Down West Mount Dr., not too far from the four corners store (some call this area Sandy Cross Roads) me and my family used to live there in an very old house. This is a very peaceful place in the day but at night you would think that all devils in hell have broke loose in our house, I can't even think of just one time of having a good night's rest in this house.

Me growing up as a child was very hard because I was born, or should I say, blessed with an spiritual eyesight and could see spirits any time day or night, and I feel that somehow they're drawn to me because everywhere I go, somehow I always seem to run into one and they are always lurking and peeping around corners. Every night in this house was hell for me because there was always crazy sounds of something in the loft at night, and in the kitchen it would sound as though something was jumping from the loft onto the floor.

That was annoying to me, one night when I heard this sound, I went to see if I could see anything just to see a black cat sitting on the table, we did not own one, scared to death, I ran off screaming telling my parents about the cat in the kitchen. They thought I was telling a tale. This sound of someone jumping from the loft in the kitchen went on every night when every one was sleeping, some nights I would go to bed early because I knew that when every one else go to sleep, I was always the one that could not sleep and I liked getting my nap first because at night, it seemed like my six sense would kick in and my spiritual eye would open up.

The last night I can remember in this creepy old house, was me seeing the black cat jumping from the loft and seeing it walk slowly to my room, I remember being scared and covering my head and seeing the cat leap on to the bed I was in. Looking at him through the sheet seeing his shadow, I began to shake with fear, the cat jumped back down to the floor, I thought it was over just for this cat to transform into a skinny old man with one of those old pot hats on, you know the old long one. I can remember shaking even more as my teeth began to knock and covering my head again, just for this man to come stand over me, fondling and tickling my body from the other side of the sheet. I began to wetting the bed. All I can remember was blacking out and waking up the next day scared, that was my last night spent on West Mount Dr. in Rocky, Mount NC.

To this day I still have spooky encounters. I have been scared so much in my youth until now, it's just a thing I'm not scared anymore.

Dreams of my Dead Aunt,"West Virginia, United States",Family / Friends Visits,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Family / Friends Visits :: Dreams of my Dead Aunt

I was just wondering if anyone out there can help me with this. My grandparents were killed in a car accident five years ago on July 2. My aunt and my cousin were in the accident as well, but they both survived. However, one year ago, on June 30, my aunt passed away in her sleep. She was only 45 years old and died from an accidental overdose. A combination of her pain medicine, nerve medicine, muscle relaxer, and very little alcohol.

I have never had a dream about my grandmother since she died. I had one dream about my grandfather where he was just standing on a dock by the water, looking back at me.

However, with my aunt, I keep having dreams about her. I have dreamt about her for the past two months. I have had three dreams regarding her. She is very much alive in these dreams. In one of the dreams, I am hugging her and then she asks me ""Why are you the only one who can see me?"" I then turn to her daughter and say ""Shannon, did you not just see me hugging your mom?"" Shannon looks at me like I am crazy and says NO!

My aunt and I use to be close when I was younger, but as I grew up and noticed that she was an alcoholic, we became more distant. We still talked before she died, but not like we used to. Her daughter is not doing well in life. She has starting doing drugs, partying a lot, and very sexually active.

Some people seem to think my aunt is wanting to live through me, while others think she is wanting me to help her daughter, Shannon. (I used to have custody of Shannon when she was younger, I took care of her every time her mom, my aunt, was in rehab.) Is there anyone out there who might be able to help me understand these dreams?

Happy Birthday,Philippines,Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: Happy Birthday

W hen I was 9 years old, we lived in a 3 bedroom house that has a big front & backyard. Nothing was odd or weird going on at the first few months after we moved in. As the months go by, I started feeling that something is wrong or something is going on inside & around the house. I would hear footsteps in the hallway when no one's there. I would see the bathroom lights turning on and off by itself even when no one was using it. The electric fan was on even when it wasn't even plugged. The chandelier would sway back and forth for no apparent reason.

It got worse at night, especially when we're all asleep. I would wake up in the middle of the night and see by my bedroom door a woman slowly floating away. I would see shadows even when the lights were on. I saw a woman in white in my backyard just staring at the full moon.

Finally, one night, I woke up and at the foot of my bed was a woman staring outside my bedroom window. I thought it was my mom so I called out ""Mom?"". The woman turned around and she smiled at me. Then she said ""Happy Birthday"". Because I was so drowsy with sleep that I just said ""thanks"". The following morning I asked my mom if she was in my bedroom and greeted me happy birthday. My mom said ""No, I wasn't in your room this morning or last night"" I didn't want to know who was in my bedroom that night.

We moved out of that house after 3 years. The family that moved in after us had worse experience than us. But that's another story...

Strange  Encounter,"Texas, United States",Poltergeists / Physical Manifestations,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Poltergeists / Physical Manifestations :: Strange  Encounter

I was alone, and it just turned dark, about 7:30pm, my mom was at my aunt's house, and my dad was working on a car at my grandmother's house. I was making some soup and some bbq meat to eat. At about 9 o'clock, my power went out. I ran out of my house and went to the breaker box to trip the power back on. When I came back, in noticed my door to my room was open as if someone walked through and forgot to close it. About ten minutes later, the power went out again, there I go running outside again. Again I tripped the power back on and went back inside. As I was sitting there eating my food, I felt this strong feeling of being watched. I went around the house turning on the lights and TV's. With the AC on my door would move very slowly with the air, and for some reason I could not keep my eyes off of my room.

When I was done eating, I decided to go in my room to see what was so interesting. As I was walking to the door the power went out again, and I ran out like a bat out of hell. This time for some reason it took longer to get the power back on. When I finally got it back on, I went straight for my room, the door was shut, fully closed and as I opened it there was a huge cold chill that came over me. I stayed in the doorway looking in with the light from the kitchen causing my shadow to appear on the wall in front of me. I said ""If anything is in here, you need to get out RIGHT NOW"" Just as I looked down, the box of my black light moved across the room in front of me. About 5 feet from my dresser to my bed.

I could not believe my eyes, was this really happing? Tears came to my eyes and I closed the door and went to the phone. I called my mom at my aunt's house and told her that she needed to come home as soon as she could. She told me she was leaving and would be there in about 5 minutes. I sat on the couch and waited, a few minutes later I could hear the footsteps on the porch and was relieved. I went to open the door, nobody was there. I called again to see if my mom had left yet and she was the one that answered the phone. I told her, crying ""please come home now"".

When she got there, I was so scared, I told her everything that happened and she said that has happened to me before. But she never told us because she didn't want to scare us. Thanks a lot mom.

I never figured out what was there that night, but it only happened there a few more times, then it was something else but that's another story!

After my Grandfather Died,"Pennsylvania, United States",Family / Friends Visits,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Family / Friends Visits :: After my Grandfather Died

T his is a true story about after my grandfather died. He died about 4 years ago. He was the first person that I ever really cared about and lost. After he died, I was just looking for some kind of sign that he was at peace and okay. Not long after he died, maybe a few weeks, my grandmother was at the house lying in bed, now she was 70 years old and blind. My uncle, her son, was staying at the house with her to care for her. Now let it be known that my grandmother was as sharp as a wit! She was no regular old lady!

She said she was laying in bed and all of a sudden she felt the bed move, as if someone had laid down beside her. She thought maybe my uncle had sleep walked into the bed. She called out my uncle's name and he didn't answer, she said his name again, and this time he answered back. Only she realized that his voice was not beside her but in the other room. She knew that somebody or something had laid there beside her that night.

My uncle had an experience where while he was staying at the house, he slept out on the couch. He would keep a picture of the family on the table in front of him, which included my grandfather of course. Well, he always kept the picture facing him, only one day when he woke up, the picture was facing the opposite direction. Now mind you that my grandmother can not walk either and used a wheelchair, and she and my uncle were the only two in the house.

My uncle also said that a few days after my grandfather had passed, that he was laying down on the couch where my grandfather would always lay. He said at one point he felt like he could not breath. It felt like something had its hand over my uncle's face. We kind of thought maybe my grandfather's spirit was still in the house and not only did he lay beside my grandmother that night ,like he always did, but that maybe he was sitting in his favorite spot where my uncle was laying and he pressed his hand down on the arm of the chair to rise up from the couch where my uncles head just happened to be and maybe that's when he felt his face being smothered.

I also thought too that there was something strange behind my being accepted into nursing school. Exactly a month or so after he passed away, I was awaiting to see if I had been accepted or not, and unfortunately found out that I wasn't. I was already devastated over losing my grandfather and would talk to him everyday. Not getting into nursing school just took the cake.

Well one day that month after he passed, I received a phone call from the school telling me I had been considered and had to be there that day to register because class started the very next day! I mean everyone else had already been chosen, and here it was school started the next day. I always thought how close that happened to my grandfather's death, and really believe he had something to do with that.

Also, my aunt who lived in the next county was laying on her couch asleep. Her husband works the night shift. She was alone in the house. Something had awakened her from her sleep. She said when she opened her eyes, there was my grandfather standing there in front of her bending over her in one of his favorite flannel shirts. Needless to say she jumped up and shouted ""oh my god, what are you doing here"", I forgot what he had said to her but he had disappeared before her eyes. She said she got up and went to check the rooms and there he was standing in the kitchen. Then he disappeared.

Last, my other aunt said she was with my grandmother one day at the house and my grandmother was laying down in the bedroom while my aunt was out in the other room. My aunt said that all of a sudden she could hear my grandmother talking to herself, saying ""I said No, I'm not ready to go yet..."" My aunt asked her if she was okay and who was she talking to, and my grandmother said, ""It's your father, don't you see him at the foot of the bed""? ""He's trying to get me to come with him!"" At that point my aunt said she never did go back into the bedroom again. The next year almost exactly 14 months later, my grandmother also passed away.

I hope you enjoyed my stories, as these are true events of things that took place after my grandfather passed away.

Wright Street Haunting,"West Virginia, United States",Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: Wright Street Haunting

I n a small community, in lewis co, stands a small cottage home that dates back well beyond 1935. I bought the property in April of 2001, not knowing the home was haunted. I've always believed in ghosts, but I never guessed my home to be haunted. Boy was I wrong, many times after moving in, late at night, I could hear what sounded to be a female's voice, then at times, was a man's. Never sure of what was being said.

One morning I was awakened by the bedroom door to where I was sleeping, opening and slamming shut. Time moved on, many things happened, I got married, my wife was awakened to the blankets jerked off her, it was almost like they didn't like her and waited for me to leave for work. She was knocked down many times, and hit on, slapped and her hair would get pulled. A young female apparition, started appearing many places in the house, sometimes appearing solid as me and sometimes transparent.

I decided to try to record any phenomenon I could get. During the time of the recording, I got a young girl saying ""I lost something in monteka"". An older lady, saying that a man that lives upstairs is a hardnose. Keep in mind it's only a single story home. Who these people are I haven't a clue. After hearing the evps, I decided to look in the attic for any clues to anything that had been happening.

Well Low and behold, I found a room that I was not aware of. I opened the door and it was only big enough for a small cot and room to walk by it. So I assume this may be where the man the older lady was referring to stays. The only one ever to see this old man was my daughter. She describes him as being short, bent over and mean looking.

As the house sits empty, still yet to this day, many sounds and the gray gloomy shadows still hover over my wright st cottage home.

Spirit in my School,"Wisconsin, United States",Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: Spirit in my School

I n my previous story I told about my house and my friend's house being haunted. Well more than that was haunted, my school. I have graduated from the small private catholic school that I have learned so much from. I never knew that the entity I had stumbled across at the park the fall day would follow me to school.

I proved to certain people that I did indeed have a spirit with me. But it was not only my class that got proof. Here are things I witnessed, happen to others. Some cases happened to me.

1)I took a bathroom break one day, I walked past the science room. I heard the younger class complaining of screeching noises and nails on a chalkboard.

2) My school had a fish fry every 2nd Friday of the month. I was hanging out with a 7th grader (I in 8th grade) I remembered I forgot something in my locker, we took the elevator to get up to the 2nd floor. As the doors opened, I saw a shadow figure out of the corner of my eye just vanish. Then for some reason the 7th grader started to talk of the school being haunted. I think she saw it too.

3) I was getting a drink, walking down the hallway. When two students in the grade below me ran up to me, they said they saw a shadow figure run into the art room.

4) I had basketball practice after school on Tuesday and Thursday in 7th grade. I was sitting down as usual, having to do with me being so useless to the team. I looked in the lobby area outside the gym, and saw a shadow figure, I though nothing of it. I thought it was my stepfather by the sight of what I thought was a jacket. I turned around to see if it was him, but I saw no one.

5) In 7th grade my friend told me how she heard someone whisper her name then tap her shoulder. In 8th grade I felt the same thing. I was in history, I felt a tap and heard my name I looked around to see everyone doodling or reading. I know what you thinking they could have been pulling a prank, but my class had no interest in me, they wouldn't want to pull a prank on me.

So many things have happened there, and I will never have even one happen again.
