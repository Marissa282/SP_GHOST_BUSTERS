A Warning from my Mother,"Ohio, United States",Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: A Warning from my Mother

A year after my mother died, I had become very close to my thrill seeking friend Beth. We would go into this little patch of forest behind her house ALL the time, and every time we would go in, that night I would have a dream of that forest and my mother would be there, staring at me.

One night I was in my kitchen, cooking me some dinner because I had just gotten home from the woods, and then I felt like I was being watched. My mother had died in the room next to the kitchen, do to the fact she died of cancer. I felt stiff as stone for a moment and then right when I thought it was gone, I heard a whisper that sounded like ""don't go...""

It sounded a lot like my mother but, do to the fact that at the time I still did not fully believe in ghosts, I shrugged it off and went to bed. But that night I had a dream of my mother and she told me something horrible was in the forest, and then she pointed her finger into the forest and I looked into it and saw what appeared to be a demon of sorts.

The next day I went back into the forest, not heading my mother's warning. That day we went into a long tunnel, where many people were supposedly killed back when it was first made (It's a man made tunnel... like a sewer system almost). Beth and I were sitting, chatting about what we had been doing since school started again when it began to get darker. It was almost pitch black and we kept a flashlight with us, because we wanted to see how long we could stay out. Then I heard what sounded a lot like children laughing... But I thought it was just my mind playing tricks on me due to the fact that it was dark.

But when I looked at Beth she was staring into the dark tunnel. I didn't dare look into the tunnel, because I didn't want to know what she was seeing. But then we both got up, freaked out and then Beth said 'stay here' (I was on the edge of the tunnel, so technically I'm in it. The opposite point of the tunnel is the only way to get back to her house, and it's large enough to stand in and run through). So I felt like I was being watched in the horribly dark tunnel and I was standing as still as I could, like a deer in headlights. Beth had gone out of the tunnel, searching for the laughter. While she was gone, I heard footsteps behind me, as if someone was actually near me. Then a male whispered in my ear ""don't turn around"" and I was so startled, I turned around. But no one was there. I looked deeper into the tunnel and saw what seemed to be a white flash pass by. Then Beth came back in the tunnel and I told her and we both agreed that we should leave the tunnel.

We ran through the tunnel screaming our lungs out, and kept on running through the woods. But as we were leaving the tunnel, we both heard what seemed to be a woman screaming in pain. But we were both so freaked out we didn't stop until we got home.

That stopped me from ever going into the forest again at night, I still go during the day but now I feel like I'm being watched. That was two years ago, now I've had a lot more psychic events going on with me, and a lot of the times it'll first appear in dreams before happening in real life.

I know I'm not hallucinating anything though because she heard it too, and many of my friends have been with me when I actually saw some of the things I did.

"The Questionable CA Case: Demon, Poltergeist or Mental Instability?","California, United States",Ghost Hunting,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Ghost Hunting :: The Questionable CA Case: Demon, Poltergeist or Mental Instability?

I have always been a curious creature. I joined the Ordo Rosae Crucis (AMORC) aka the Rosicrucians to better understand secret societies. When I was going to college, I did a book report on cults like the Hare Krishna, Peoples' Temple, Church of Scientology and even the Church of Satan, by actually visiting these cults and talking with the members of these cults. Of course, I got an A in Sociology for actually doing my own personal investigations of these cults. The funny thing is that the Church of Scientology and the Church of Satan actually asked me to leave, because I was counteracting everything they were saying and it angered them. As a ghost writer and paranormal investigator for P.I.T. (Paranormal Investigation Team). I want to better understand ghosts, spirits, poltergeist activity, demons, residual hauntings. How can I do this? Easy, by learning firsthand though a professional outfit like PIT. Today, I will learn a lot. Tonight Johnny Walker, who will lead this investigation gathered the team of Michelle Leonard, Technical Operator/Paranormal Investigator/Spiritual Guide; Florence Kawamoto, President/Team Leader and of course yours truly Apaullo Adalere Robertson, Writer/Paranormal Investigator. The day is April 26, 2007, Friday. The location is: California. Residence will remain confidential and the occupants of the home will only be referred to as Male Occupant 1 and Female Occupant 2. Let's get on with this bizarre story, as you will find out as you continue with this article.

Johnny Walker interviewed Female Occupant 2. Age 18. She makes the following claims, that late at night she saw a full body apparition, a dark figure in her kitchen. The entity played with her hair. The entity scratched her leg in two different areas of her legs and she showed us the scratches. One of the scratches looked like it read ""V1"". She claims that the entity has been felt in the computer room and in the bathroom, where it is being remodeled. She even said that when she saw the entity that it disappeared in her bathroom and went into a hole into the basement. She says that last Saturday in the morning, she saw a child ghostly figure, that had no face, but she was able to distinguish a main outline of what appeared to be a child. Another night, she woke up in a cold sweat and felt something hovering over her. Last Wednesday around 8pm she saw a huge black shadow and the shadowy entity gave off the presence of evil. When she saw this entity, she ran outside to the car where her boyfriend (Male Occupant 1) was and she was scared to death. Two different times she saw a shadowy outline of a man peering out of the bedroom window. The outline of the peering window entity had a glowing outline, but was solid black. When the entity played with her hair by pulling it, she received up to 3 scratches right afterwards. She even received scratches on her back. Once she had a mysterious black line on her leg, that later disappeared. She also has received pain on the back of her legs. When she almost called a preacher to bless the house, the entity grabbed her arm as if trying to stop her. She says that at one time she was heavily involved with the Wicca culture, dabbled in black magic, did incantations and played with Ouija Boards. Right now, she is not involved in the Wicca culture. She said that she had a miscarriage and it occurred in this house.

Male Occupant 1. Age 40. Has (OCD) obsessive compulsive disorder for abnormal collecting. In layman terms, he is a pack rat. All throughout the house, there were newspapers and magazines piled up almost to the ceiling, tons of video games piled up, garbage, rotten meat, half eaten cookies, carefully collected and wrapped Snicker bar wrappers and other garbage that anyone in their right mind would throw away. The house is a safety hazard. The home belongs to Male Occupant 1 and he has been living in filth for quite a long time. I was absolutely appalled when I stepped into the home. We could barely walk through the house, because there was so much garbage all over. Female Occupant 2 is 18 years old, but has the mentality of a 12 year old. The PIT team thought since she dabbled with black magic and once played with an Ouija Board, that she could have brought a demon into her home. Michelle, playing the role of a demonologist (something she is not fond of) threw out holy water on all corners of each room and on all entrances. While doing this she said prayers out loud attempting to dispel any demon entity. I walked around with either a video camera or temperature gauge, some areas I would point to, would go up as high as 106, then back to normal 64. When the occupants left the home for 30 minutes, Michelle blessed the house, she was equipped with crucifixes, holy water and sage. During our investigation, we had the following experiences. Florence and I smelled the distinct smell of smoke in the computer room and later the front doorway. As fast as the smell came, it went away. Michelle felt like someone touched her hair. We were trying to determine if a bag in the kitchen area moved on its own accord, we were undetermined if this actually occurred. What is odd about this home, is that there is no toilet, the occupants have to leave their home to utilize a public bathroom. As we continued doing out investigation, books fell over. Our solutions to the smell of smoke, was that perhaps we were smelling the garbage around the house. Florence and I both agree it was the smell of smoke, but then again... You never know. Since there is so much garbage in this home, could it be that Female Occupant 2 scratched her leg due to bumping into the garbage around her home? Could Female Occupant 2 subconsciously be wanting to leave this home, because her boyfriend has a pack rat syndrome and she can't live in these filthy conditions? Perhaps the books fell to the floor on their own accord, due to the vibrations received when we walked by?

Johnny theorized that perhaps Female Occupant 2 at the border age of 18, could be experiencing poltergeist activity that her own person is projecting. Poltergeist activity usually occurs when a young child is going through puberty and the energy that is bottled up inside their persona is released causing tapping & knocking sounds on walls, books flying off shelves, cabinets opening and closing. Female Occupant 2 showed no signs of maturity and talked as if she was a little girl. She claims only 4 years ago, she would witness objects flying around.

As Johnny briefed the couple on what the possibilities were, Female Occupant 2 became quite emotional, she became defensive in her words towards Johnny. She felt that we were blaming her for the activity and that we thought it was her imagination. The PIT team left the residence feeling sadness, that this house is in such a disarray and that these two live under these conditions and seem unconcerned about it. How sad, that when they need to utilize the restroom, they must actually get in their car and go somewhere. When I looked into the basement hole in the bathroom, I saw a big black rat with a long tail. When seeing this, it depressed me. Michele did a 'hedge of protection' prayer around Female Occupant 2. We held hands and said the prayer with Michele leading, just in case there is demonic activity. When we left we noticed that this whole neighborhood has black rabbits roaming the neighborhood yards. Someone long ago released some pet rabbits and the rabbits have multiplied and roam from house to house. The neighborhood has accepted the rabbits as part of their neighborhood family.

As we drove back to home, we talked about the investigation and how we were all horrified about the experience. We were all saddened and we struggled to find other source of humor to bring our spirits back up. Before long, we discussed on how another investigation that Kathy, leading a group came across a big white stuffed rabbit and let out a blood curdling scream, because she thought the maniacal stuffed rabbit was some sort of entity. We had a good laugh. Then we discussed on investigating UFO sighting claims near and around Mt. Shasta. We are not limited to ghosts, spirits and whatnot. We are PIT investigators. We investigate anything paranormal. I explained to the group my experiences at Mt. Shasta. They were game. As we drove by a sign that read ""Lake Berryessa"", we discussed the Zodiac killings and how Zodiac terrorized the couple at Lake Berryessa, stabbing both of them and how the girl died. When we got to the toll booth, we left the money in the trunk, causing the drivers behind us some irritation that lead to some horn honking and one driver flipping us off. We made a pit stop at a gas station only to see a man being slapped up to 16 times by his drunk girlfriend and he took it like a man. We got in the car and busted up laughing, because it was such a comical sight. We were back in good spirits. Hey, we're PIT! Now at this point, I am going to let ----- take over the article, she can explain if there are any findings and the conclusion to this strange and bizarre investigation. An investigation into madness.

Ancestral Visitors?,"California, United States",Apparitions / Voices / Touches,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Apparitions / Voices / Touches :: Ancestral Visitors?

T hank you for taking the time to read my story, true, and changed my life for ever. My father and I were, and are, part of a divorced parents group that would take part in activities on the weekends. Softball, bowling, but most of all, camping. We were scheduled to visit Three Links campground located in WiMuk California. This campground, being known for a nice weekend getaway, is also known for it's rich history of the MiWuk Native Americans that lived in the area many years before.

I was 15 or 16 years old when my experience took place, I am in my early 30's now.

My father and I arrived on a Friday morning and had set up our tents, cooked lunch and went our separate ways for the day, to reunite that evening and have a gathering around the fire with the rest of the campers.

I had met up with a couple other kids my age and hiked south to an area of the campground that was completely flat and and devoid of any foliage or vegetation. It was bizarre to see for a split second, but soon turned to the perfect football field. Thinking nothing more of it we finished up our play near dusk and were headed back to the main camp.

As the sun fell, dark clouds rolled in. Before we knew it, all of us were trying to salvage our food and keep the pouring rain out of our tents.

One of our more outgoing members, an adult, had spoken with the camp director who allowed us as a group to spend the remainder of the night in the group meeting facility located on premises.

Having now been assured a decent night of dry sleep, we had all settled in (on the floor) to sleep for the night. We weren't in the meeting facility more than a couple of hours before a woman in the group started whispering about a ""feeling"" she was getting. She was talking about a benevolent presence. Apparently she was picking up something. I was a staunch skeptic even at the age of 15. The woman stood up and walked to the front door of the room and opened the door. She stood there for a minute, mouth agape, as we all started to make our way to where she was standing to see for ourselves.

At this point we were all standing on the wrap around deck to the large wood building. Looking far onto the dirt walk below, the woman began describing a figure moving toward us on the walk. After a minute of looking through the downpour I saw what looked like a silhouette of a tall man walking up the path. I could not see a face or any defining features, just as what I can best describe as a slight distortion in the falling rain. There was a large flood light that illuminated from about fifty yards across the way, attached high in a tree. This did not seem to make it any easier to see the apparition.

The figure eventually stopped just before the front stoop of the meeting room deck and just stood there for what seemed like for ever, but was more than likely a minute or so before becoming completely unseen.

After the experience, the group retreated to the warmth of the big hall and silently went to sleep. Nobody really talked about it for a while, I can only assume that it may have been fear of divulging what may have been a group psychosis. After a little time had passed and a couple of camping trips later, the group that was there talked about the experience a little more. The woman who had claimed that she had the ""feeling"" had apparently, in the subsequent months, done more research into the history of the area and found that there was a burial ground near by. Whether this has anything to do with our experience is still unknown to me, as I have done a little research of my own to no avail. There are not very many resources to historical information in the area.

Currently, I have become consumed with the study of, and attempt to capture evidence of the world beyond. Even as far as to purchase the laptop I am writing on now, EVP recorders, cameras and sound software.

I have had a couple strange experiences since that night, but none as personal or vivid in my memory.

Lisa's Spooky House,"Florida, United States",Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: Lisa's Spooky House

I have a friend named Lisa, she's 13 or 14, I'm not sure. My sister Sara knows her much better. I was to spend the night at her house, and I was excited. Now, I don't think MY experiences are ""ghostly"", but Lisa's were! I decided to include all that happened:

Lisa's Dad wakes up every couple hours, and it was about 10 or 11 at night, and he was asleep. So we sat in the kitchen. Lisa's house is shaped like a plane. I'm not kidding. Her room comes down the sides in a long point. And get this: Her doorknob is in the CENTER of her front door. So, we always enter the side door, which is connected to the driveway next to the shed outside. Once you walk in the side door, you walk through a teeny tiny room that has a slideable door that they always leave open, so it's as if the teeny tiny room is part of the kitchen.

In the teeny room, there is a washing machine and a pantry full of food. Then you enter the kitchen. It is nice sized, and has a TV. So we all sat on Alexia's (one of the girls' who was there, along with Erica, Sara my sister, and Lisa's little sis, Susan) laptop and checked our myspace's and prank called some enemies. We were sitting in the kitchen, when suddenly, the motion sensor light outside turned on, and the dog went crazy. We thought we heard a car or something, so we close the blinds on the windows and leaned against the cabinets so nobody could see through the windows and see us.

SI don't know what that was, maybe a possum... well, eventually, we got in bed and went to sleep. And, I cannot remember clearly what happened then... I don't remember if I heard a scratch or a shuffle, but I heard a weird sound coming from the hallway, but I ignored it and fell asleep.

The next morning, I told Lisa, and the games began... She told me it was probably the ghost. I was shocked. I didn't know anything about it. You guys probably think it's no biggie, but just focus on the following ghost stories:

You see, Susan would constantly ask somebody to go with her through the house to go somewhere, like the kitchen for example. Lisa explained it was because she and her sister had been haunted in this house all their lives. Lisa said she USED to scare Susan by jumping up behind her and making a loud hissing sound like a cat, which scared Susie. Lisa said she remembered one night how she was laying in bed, and she suddenly heard a LOUD and real cat hissing very loud, like it was right next to her. Lisa said she almost wet her pants, and was scared so bad. She said from then on, she didn't scare Susie that way, and she didn't hear that cat again.

Next, is her parents bedroom. It is paranormal central. Lisa says she can see weird stuff in the mirrors at night, and ghosts in the bathrooms.

Lisa said that Susan always plays her PSP every night before going to bed. One night, Lisa remembers Susan came in her room at about 11 at night and stood in the doorway or something. Lisa said Susan was really excited and said ""Lisa, I got on a really high level and got so many points you won't believe it!"" and Lisa said ""Susie, it's like, 11 at night, you played for way too long, go to bed and close my door..."" But Susan walked away and didn't close the door. Lisa shouted to her to close her door, and eventually got up and closed it. The next morning, Lisa asked Susan why she didn't close her door - But Susan just stared at her blankly and said ""Lisa, you never told me to close it..."" And Lisa said ""Yeah, when you came in my room to tell me about your game..."" and then Susan said ""But I never came in your room, I was fast asleep...""

Lisa said the ghost really mess with her head big time. Susan has a story herself...

She said one time, she was in the living room watching TV, and a commercial came on. While she waited, she would stare at the little dried up fish on top of the TV. She said she looked at one and it was staring at her, and she found that weird, because she had never noticed he stared in that direction before. She looked away, and then look back, and the fish's eyes had moved! She said she told Lisa, but Lisa didn't believe her. And I think I can believe Lisa because she couldn't have come up with these stories all at once. And she even asked if we thought she was crazy, but I don't.

The Faithful Dog,"New York, United States",Pets / Animals,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Pets / Animals :: The Faithful Dog

A family across the street from us owned a German Shepard named Tino. Now, before I tell the story I have to say that Tino was a beast. He was very protective of the family and when people came by their house, he barked non-stop. You could never mistake his barking with another dog, as he had this very distinct loud howl he would do. Well, not too long ago Tino passed away with old age. After Tino died, the whole family was heart broken. He was their protector, and they loved him. Here is the story.

A week or so after Tino died, the family went on vacation to Florida to see their relatives. They stayed there for about a week, maybe less.

I am a good friend of this family, and would go over their house on many occasions because I live across the street. So they left me in charge of getting their mail and bringing it inside.

One day I had a buddy over, and we were hanging out in my backyard. I then remembered I had to get their mail. I got it and brought it through the backyard and to their backdoor. (They left me a key to the backdoor so I could walk right into the kitchen and drop it on the table, as that was the easiest way.) While carrying the mail I got a phone call, so I put the mail down on the patio table in the backyard and answered it. After I was done with my call I put my phone down and picked up the mail, and brought it inside. I walked back to my house and left my phone on the table by accident.

When I realized this, I told my buddy to go retrieve it, because I am kind of a lazy person. My buddy came back not a minute later and said ""No way I'm going in that backyard, that dog is nuts!"". I couldn't believe what he had just said. I asked him what he was talking about, and he told me that when he went to the fence to go to the backyard, a German Shepard ran towards the fence and began to howl and bark. I couldn't believe what he had just said, so I ran to the neighbors house with my buddy and went into the backyard. Nothing was there. I told him that the dog he described died about a week ago. My buddy was dumbfounded and said, ""But... but I swear I saw a dog, it almost attacked me..."" He had never been even remotely close to that house before, there was no way he could have made that story up.

Well, the next night I went to bed thinking about it, and heard a growling howl. Not any ordinary howl, but Tino's howl. I quickly looked out my window towards the house, but nothing was there. I knew Tino was still watching over that backyard.

As soon as the family got home, I told them what happened. They weren't scared at all, they were actually looking forward to anything happening. That's how much they loved that dog. It just goes to show how much Tino cared for that family, as he protected the house during his Life and in Death.

"Poltergeist at my Sisters, the Beginning","Texas, United States",Psychic / Medium,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Psychic / Medium :: Poltergeist at my Sisters, the Beginning

M y husband and I had moved to Texas for the military and 6 months after we got there we moved on post. A few months after we moved in stuff started happening. My husband finally opened up to me and started telling me that he sees stuff and that he has, since he was 8 years old. I found it interesting because growing up, I always believed in the paranormal and thought it an interesting subject.

When he was 8 years old, he moved to Ohio and one night he had his bedroom door cracked open. It swung open really fast and the door stopped right before it was going to hit the wall. He said that a tall dark shadow figure stood in the doorway and ever since then, it has followed him where ever he goes. When they had just moved in that house, there was dead animals hanging in the attic. They removed it and each day there was more. This happened for about 3 weeks and it stopped.

Another incident at that house was about his mom. She was a few months pregnant and she says that she felt a strong force push her down the stairs. She ended up miscarrying her child.

They moved out of the house and ended up in Iowa. She never had anymore problems that I'm aware of, but my husband, Patrick, always saw them around the farm outside, but never in the house. He blew it off and ignored them growing up.

Since we moved to Texas it has progressed into more things. He had left for training for a few weeks and the night he left, I had to sleep with the light on because it felt very uncomfortable. I was almost asleep when I heard something whisper in my ear. It said ""get out..."" I woke up suddenly and looked around the room and nothing was there. My dog lay on the floor beside the bed and she did nothing. I fell back asleep in the REM stage and felt very cold fingertips on my neck. I sat up really quick and told them to leave me alone. I went back to sleep that night restfully. Luckily my twin brother was coming the next day. He was stationed there with us and so he kept me company and they left me alone.

Another instance in that house, I was in the bathroom doing my hair and the toilet flushed by itself. I walked around the house and when I checked the kitchen and the cabinets were open.

One night my husband, friend and I were sitting in the living room watching a movie. This was around Christmas time in 2005. Patrick had finished his drink and set it on the side table next to the couch. When the movie was almost over, something hit the cup and it flew up in the air, twirled, and then landed on the floor laying on its side. We all looked at each other confused. We blew it off and went about finishing our movie. By the time the movie was over, the cup was sitting upside down. My friend was really freaked out but the hubby and I just brushed it off because we were use to the behavior. She was always freaked out to come over but still did regardless of the shadows she would see on the wall.

My friend and I (same friend) were sitting around one night just having a drink socially and my husband called out to me in a scared voice. I went in there and he said that they were pulling on his leg. He said that a big green, gargoyle looking face came out of the corner and shot right at him and scared him to death.

Now once my brother moved in there with us, it didn't bother us anymore. Until we moved...

Grandma's House,"Rhode Island, United States",Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: Grandma's House

I 'm Tiffany from RI. I'm 17 years old. Here are a few of my experiences. A few months ago me, my aunt, my uncle, and my 2 cousins went to spend a few days at my grandmother's house in New Hampshire. It's a cozy little place and very relaxing. My aunt, uncle, and my little cousin Tyler who was about 5 at the time, went outside to roast marshmallows. I think it was about between 9 or 10 at night.

Well, me and my cousin were fooling around on her laptop in my grandmother's bedroom. We had a tray set up to place the laptop on it and we'd sit on the edge of the bed. My cousin Taylor (who is 3 years younger than me) decided to go get a few marshmallows and joined the others outside. I was by myself in the room. Maybe 10 minutes had passed and I felt someone plop down on the other side of the bed. I knew nobody had come in because I would be heard the door. I got up and went outside with the others, unable to shake the creepy feeling I had.

I also remember a few months prior to this experience, it was just me, my cousin Taylor and my aunt went to NH, just the 3 of us. Me and my cousin were once again hanging out in my grandmother's bedroom. All of a sudden I got a horrible, awful headache. I felt like I would throw up. I left the room in search of some Tylenol. When I left the room, everything went away. No headache, no wanting to vomit. I was like ""Okay"" and went back in the room. It all came back all of a sudden. I left the room again and it disappeared. I found this really strange. A couple weeks ago, I talked to one of my friends about this and she said something had probably happened in that room.

I think my grandmother's house is haunted. A women next door died a few months after she bought the house. Her name was Ida. When my uncle and his girlfriend were there, they were sleeping on the air mattress on the living room floor. He felt like someone was standing next to him so he turned but nobody was there. In the morning he told his girlfriend about it. She replied, ""You felt that, too?! I was too scared to turn around and check!""

Another time with the SAME house: me and my cousin were sleeping in the sun porch. Then we heard footsteps outside, back and forth, back and forth. We became freaked out. My aunt told us it was probably a dog or something, but there's a big difference between animal footsteps and a humans. We got scared so we moved into the living room. After a few minutes of getting settled and ready to sleep, the footsteps started again outside the front door and the windows about where we were laying down!

What do you all think? Ghosts? Maybe the footstep thing could've been a normal person, a stalker or something, but what do you think about the other stuff that's happened?

"Pele, the Hawaiian Goddess","Hawaii, United States",Apparitions / Voices / Touches,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Apparitions / Voices / Touches :: Pele, the Hawaiian Goddess

H i, my name is marissa and this happened on the big island of hawai'i. My parents and I were looking for our hotel late at night and were getting frustrated. Then, we saw this old lady sticking her thumb out on the side of the road. She looked innocent with her long, gray hair and wrinkled face so we picked her up. We asked her where she was going and she said ""Kona"", which is a city on the island. Now you have to imagine this: We were in Hilo which is about 100 miles from the Kona coast. I secretly knew that my parents were hesitating about taking her to her destination because it was so far and it was about 9:00 at night. Kona can be pretty dangerous at night. So I looked at her and she was just gazing out the window, although the way to Kona was pitch black because the city doesn't have much streetlights. She asked my parents for a cigarette and they didn't smoke so they offered to drive her to get some. She said ""mahalo"" and patiently waited. About 5 minutes later when I checked on the old woman, SHE WAS GONE! She couldn't have got out of the car so fast! We had a van with locked doors and she simply dissapeared! I asked my mom and dad if they had let her get out and they said they didn't. What do you think? I think it was Pele* in her old woman form.

* Pele is the hawaiian goddess of volcanoes and usually appears in a form and is usually found on the side of the road trying to get an item. She sometimes appears in people's dreams.

Bloody Mary,"California, United States",Poltergeists / Physical Manifestations,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Poltergeists / Physical Manifestations :: Bloody Mary

T his story is about my friend Cassie, Cassie's step sister, Macie and I after what happened in Party gone wrong we were at my house and were telling ghost stories and reliving our past experience when Cassie decided to try ""Bloody Mary"". In my bedroom my closet doors are mirrors so it's like having four full length mirrors. The lights were already off so we sat on my bed and looked at the mirrors.

We chanted bloody mary three times and nothing happened so we just laughed it off and turned the lights on. Nothing strange happened until my parents left to go see my aunt and uncle. We were laying on the floor getting ready to go to bed when we heard someone walking up and down the hallway and we knew we were the only ones home. Then I saw the hall light come on and my bathroom door flew open and the tap started running full force and the shower came on. Macie went and turned everything off and suddenly it was calm.  Then we heard someone drumming their fingers on my door outside in the hall. We all held our hands up to show we weren't doing it and it kept going. I jumped up and flung the door open and it stopped, then my closet doors burst open. We started praying that it would all stop and suddenly it did.

Nothing has happened since and I am so glad. Now Cassie and I don't look for ghostly encounters and we pray that they don't look for us.

Sexual Entities II,"Oregon, United States",Succubus / Incubus / Sexual Ghosts,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Succubus / Incubus / Sexual Ghosts :: Sexual Entities II

H i all, in my previous writings I indicated that when all of this started to happen, in our home, (see initial story for details), with the shadow of a person up in the corner of our bedroom, kind of sitting there, hovering, watching us sleep. Once in a while, I would see a spark of light, or a dim orb in it's place, but usually, up over our dresser in the corner. Even in the darkness of the room (although I usually have soft background lighting on), you could see it move around if you strained your eyes good enough to adjust to the limited lighting. I would tell it to go away.

During this whole time, we noticed the general feeling in the apartment was becoming much more moody, more heavy, and agitated in nature. Looking back, we began to realize we were arguing much more than we should in the healthy relationship we have been in for 11 years at that time. It seemed, whenever we would get into an argument or disagreement, it would escalate to a real argument.

One time, I noticed almost a charge in the room during one of our arguments. You know the kind, you left the refrigerator door open during the night, and it becomes an ultimatum. Good gosh, we are not like that. Bruce was smart enough to realize what was going on. He signaled to me to step outside, which I did, and we went on a walk. We talked, checked in with each other to make sure we are all right, then asked at the same time, ""Have you noticed we are angry way too much over nothing?"" Bruce explained to me that he feels something is hovering around us, watching us, and having a blast instigating things. I didn't really think about it until this conversation.

He went on to say, he would get these wild ideas in his head to argue about, and would have to really gain control to keep it from sliding into a big deal. I agreed with his assessment. So, with that, we made a promise, if either of us got too angry, to signal, and we would go outside and discuss whatever was bothering us. Boy, this proved to be a relationship saver. Many times we would almost get physical over nothing, but you could feel this evil, or malicious egging on, and even our 3 corgi dogs, always wanted to hide. They would come out in the middle of the night and start barking and growling at the stereo, and when I get out there to tell them nothing is wrong, it would turn on, full blast and the dial would turn by itself. They would really grown, and I knew then, we had a problem on our hands.

At one point, shortly after this all began, I spoke with the paranormal research organization, and they suggested we record EVP's in the apartment to see what we would get. So, I for some reason set it up in the bathroom. What I got floored many of us who have heard it. When Bruce would start the shower, you would hear this kind of growl, and an exhale, really loud on tape, but you could not hear it in real life. This would be followed by a couple of faint voices acknowledging each other or once in a while Bruce.

You could even hear some laughter, as though this group of spirits were having a great time instigating things. I did this for a while, and now have over 10 full tapes with recordings of haunting voices, and some even answer questions I pose. But the most scary of all of it, was once in a while, while recording in the bathroom, you would hear a voice say... ""Rugby, (our female Corgi's name), can you see us? And right over the voice on tape, you hear Bruce repeat the same thing out loud. That floored me. I threw the tape onto the bed and went for a walk. From this point, things began to pick up, this thing was crawling in bed with us at night, doing things with Bruce and I could not stop it. All I could do is just hold onto my partner and demand this thing to leave us alone.

I will type another segment shortly, this takes a lot out of me, and I need to think to make sure I am remembering all of it in order.

I Need Help with my Haunted House,"Pennsylvania, United States",Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: I Need Help with my Haunted House

I have owned a 130 year old home for the last five years now and I am moving. My ghost has been terrible. Before I moved in, my house was vacant for two years. Upon looking at my house to buy, I could smell matches that were just struck but no one was there. When I first moved in, he used to ring the doorbell at 3 am every night for a whole summer. Some random things would happen during summer nights where it would come in my room and walk around or watch me for hours, until I sat up with the lights on, scared to death. I have smelled him, old and sweaty and dirty... An old man.

Just recently, since we have sold our home, things have started happening after a long calm. Every night between 12 and 1am I am woken up out of a deep sleep by someone walking down the hall and coming into my room, watching me. Or I am woken up by it breathing in my ear. I asked my husband to switch sides of the bed with me, who, by the way, never hears anything. The night that I switched sides of the bed, I was woken up by something in my ear. I go to ER and they cannot find it, but fill my ear with Lidocaine. I go to a specialist who sees that my ear has been bitten severely inside and gives me drops to treat. By the way, this happened at 12:45 am.

The next night my baby wakes up screaming at 1am. He screams for two hours, on and off when I try to leave him alone. This has continued for almost 2 months. My husband works night shift... We are alone. I have asked it to leave and it does not. Please help. I don't want any harm to come to us. We move in a month. I hope it does not follow.

My History Teacher's Stories,United Kingdom,Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: My History Teacher's Stories

J ust to clarify, at the end of term, our history teacher told us some of his paranormal experiences, I shall tell these stories as if I was him so I'll be using I instead of he.

My brother got a motorbike for his 18th birthday, he was riding it about a week after he had bought it and he ended up having a collision with a lorry and went into hospital. He died a couple of days later.

A few years later, me and my girlfriend (who is now my wife) were going down to her mum's house for tea, we were waiting for them to get home as they were running late, all of a sudden the car went freezing cold and I could see my breath, I looked up to see a motorbike kind of hovering above the ground coming right towards us.

We were both terrified, we thought it was going to hit us, when all of a sudden it disappeared. (by the way it was my brother's birthday.)

When I bought my first house with my wife, it had a basement with a big old fashioned fire place which we used as a living room. We were downstairs and my wife was making sandwiches and I went to the toilet, whilst I was using the toilet, I saw a figure in the bath, but I could only see half of it, I quickly turned my head towards the bath and then laughed because it was my shirt which was drying out.

I went downstairs and my wife asked me who I was talking to whilst in the bathroom, when I said no one, she said that she definitely heard me talking to someone with a harsh voice that sounded slightly demonic.

I went downstairs and started to read my newspaper, when suddenly my wife shrieked, I ran into the kitchen and asked her what was wrong, she told me that it had just felt like someone had dragged a sharp knife down her back but there was no mark!

We got a new house a few years later and we had a bad slug problem, since it was summer, they slithered under the door into the kitchen.

One night, I awoke to an extremely loud heartbeat-like noise, I went downstairs in a trance-like state, without turning any of the lights on and every time I got closer to the kitchen, the noise got louder and louder, until I got into the kitchen and flicked on the lights, the noise then stopped and I saw a big brown slug in the middle of the kitchen which was too big for it to have slip under the door, I threw it in the bin and went back to bed.

I went next door the next day and my neighbor told me that last night, their daughter who was staying over downstairs suddenly started screaming and the lights turned on and off all on their own the exact same time as my experience.

Just remember these aren't my stories so don't criticize me if you don't believe them.

Ghost at the Mayberry Inn,"Arkansas, United States",Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: Ghost at the Mayberry Inn

I was about 13 years old at this time, and my family and I were going to the Mayberry Inn to take photos and see if we can capture orbs or other spirits in the pictures. As I stepped out of the car and looked at the white inn hidden by dense foliage, I got the chills. I said ""to anybody that is listening, I'm not here to harm you"" and I heard a jingling noise and felt cold. I looked down and saw a pile of coins. I looked in the house and saw a young woman grinning a friendly smile at me.

I walked in the house and suddenly, I was struck by fear as I looked at the fireplace, where the owner of the Mayberry Inn burned his victims. I saw the girl and she was frowning, so I said ""I'm sorry, I'm sorry"" and ran out of the house. I swiftly put the coins in my pocket that were in my fist.

We left after my mom's photos were taken and I put the coins in a little box, and that was all she wrote... Or so I thought. Ever since then, I've been seeing two little cats in my house that are not mine... And a human ghost. Before my visit to Mayberry Inn, I had a cat that died of natural causes, and occasionally I would see her walking about the house, and ever since I visited the Inn, she left. My mom says that you aren't supposed to accept gifts from ghosts because they will get in your house. I believe her now.

I rarely see the little cats anymore, and now it's the human. I feel someone watching me and holding my back every time I sit at the computer. I always look behind me. I feel cold, and like someone is staring at me. When I have my light off and it's dim and raining outside, they come into my room more. I don't really feel all that negative about them, but it freaks me out sometimes. It follows me wherever I go. Whenever I feel sad or depressed, the ghost is there and it feels comforting to me at times.

I have recently felt the little kittens laying on my bed as I was falling asleep. They were very comforting and soothing. I don't think this ghost dislikes me... I just think she wants help. I think she chose to come to my house because I suffer from sadness a lot, and so does she. She's a sad ghost, who wants peace, or maybe a friend. I don't mind the presence, and sometimes I like it.

All I have to say is, you may not be so lucky if you take a gift from a ghost... They may be angry, or even a demon, so be careful. No one likes a visit from a stranger at odd hours of the night.

Sightings of a Woman and Girl,"Texas, United States",Apparitions / Voices / Touches,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Apparitions / Voices / Touches :: Sightings of a Woman and Girl

H i guys! Call me Mikomi. I'm living in my grandparent's house and so far I've been experiencing weird things. I'm sensitive and can tell if there's a spirit by how it feels. I felt both, a sad and happy presence here.

A couple weeks after that I saw a lady in a nice white night gown. Like the old times. She stayed there for about 6 secs then left. I thought nothing of it because I'm used to it. But a couple weeks later, I just made friends and we are trying to give away this stray. She got away and went to the backyard of this creepy old house. So I'm the one to ring the doorbell, I ring it 3 times fast. Then I hear 3 knockings to match. Except it sounded distant and far off. I asked my friends if they heard it. (They were right next to me). They said no, then later on, this boy named Nick tells me that a old lady died there. Now I got freaked out a bit.

That same night while I was telling a story to our neighbor (it was about this stupid head), I saw a little girl skip across the front of my dad's car. I wasn't tired! I tried telling my little brother but he chickened out. Later on I told my friend Kayla. She experienced stuff too. Just not as much as I have. She told me to talk to whoever it is next time I see them.

At my old house I experienced stuff that scared the crap out of me. Like an evil presence in my room. I took pics with my friend on my moms digital camera phone. We saw a red figure like a man on my bed. I told her that was a evil spirit so we ran out and in my little brother's room we saw his books float. Just thought yall wanted to know.

By the way I know nothing about the history of this place and of my old house. Got any ideas besides my friend's? Please tell me!

Get an Afterlife,"Massachusetts, United States",Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: Get an Afterlife

L ast February I moved into a new apartment with my boyfriend and since then, our relationship has been on the rocks. Within this past year, I have definitely been feeling something in the bedroom and sometimes in the bathroom with me. Usually it was just the sense of a presence there, sometimes I would hear my name, and then I started feeling it getting on the bed.

At first I thought I was just imagining it all, I would tell myself it was the dog jumping on the bed and then realize he was already asleep next to me, that's when I would get scared and start saying my prayers until I fell asleep. I told a friend, who practices Santeria, about what I was experiencing and he told me that there was a spirit following me because he was jealous of my blessings. I thought my friend had gotten rid of him for a while and then the other day, after my boyfriend and I deciding to break up, I felt a presence get on to the bed with us and do me missionary style. I thought I was loosing my mind, I kept tossing and turning but I could still feel it over me, I could even feel the bed moving to his rhythm and I knew the dog was under the bed so it couldn't be him. My boyfriend was in bed next to me but I didn't say anything for fear that he would think I was nuts.

The next day I found the framed prayer I had hanging in the bedroom doorway broken on the floor and a weight I kept behind the door in the way of opening the door. That freaked me out the most because I know the weight wasn't there before and the picture seems to have lifted itself off of the wall because the hook on the wall and the frame were fine, it was just the wood frame that was cracked.

I told my boyfriend about the picture and the weight and then about last night. He said he had been awake too and felt the bed moving but thought it was the dog until I reminded him that he was the one that kicked the dog off the bed. My boyfriend immediately tried to call the most spiritual woman he knew, his mom, while sitting on the bed in the bedroom. Twice he tried to tell her what happened while in there and both times the phone cut service, it wasn't until he went into the bathroom that the phone stayed on.

I'm going to be moving into a new apartment by the end of the week and I'm afraid that the spirit will follow me there. He doesn't seem to necessarily want to hurt me yet, but he seems to be getting stronger, or at least bolder.

Is there anything I can do to make sure I'm left alone? I really feel like the spirit is laughing at me and happy that we've broken up but I'm not trying to have this go on forever. Can you tell a ghost to get an afterlife?

Back from the Dead?,Suriname,Family / Friends Visits,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Family / Friends Visits :: Back from the Dead?

H ere's a strange thing that happened the day before yesterday. A shop owner, across the street from where I live, had a heart attack. He was sitting on a bench in front of his store with some friends when he suddenly grabbed his chest and collapsed. Awaiting the ambulance, bystanders tried to revive him, but he had stopped breathing and everyone feared he was dead.

When the ambulance/doctor arrived, they proclaimed him dead. They were about to cover him up with a blanket, when he suddenly woke up. We all concluded that the doctor had probably made a mistake by proclaiming him dead. He was taken to the hospital for observation. There he told his wife that he was headed towards 'another place'. When he was about to enter this place his (dead) brother appeared out of nowhere and told him that he could not enter looking the way he did. His clothes were all dirty. So he was to return and get some clean clothes.

That's when he woke up. Nobody knows what to make of it. His wife is a bit scared of him now and his family members are convinced he had actually died, and that something else took over his body. I think he had a near death experience, but I'm not sure. This is the first time I've witnessed something like this.

My Night Attacks,"South Dakota, United States",Old Hags / Night Attacks / Sleep Paralysis,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Old Hags / Night Attacks / Sleep Paralysis :: My Night Attacks

I 've had attacks all my life. As long as I could remember. It sort of became a part of my life I guess. These nightly attacks affected my everyday life. Sometimes I was too scared to go to sleep. I never told anyone. When an attack happened, I awoke suddenly, knowing the attack was going to occur, with something putting pressure on my whole body. It always made my head turn to the left. I would scream out my sister's name and she would never wake, because it was just air coming out. I would try to fight it but couldn't.

A couple years ago, it got physical at my friends. I could see a circle floating and it was bright red and then turned black. And it flew at me, and hit my chest. The attacks take so much energy, I fall asleep right after. When I awoke a few minutes later, I ran to the mirror. And a big red circle appeared where it had hit.

These past years I fight it off. The attacks happens when it wants to. My family says it's stress and to forget about it. They always say that. I believe it may be something more. I feel someone with me all the time. I'm scared of seeing too much. I have so much life ahead of me, and having to think about this, it's really affected my life. I break down after it happens, because it really frightens me.

There was even a 1 or 2 foot spirit that visited me once. It walked slowly towards me as I was napping. I could hear the feet sliding on the carpet. The covers were blocking my view to see what it was. But I kept breaking free from the pressure, and its grip. In my head, I told it that I wasn't scared and that I would fight it. It walked out.

And to this day, I still don't know what to think of that attack. Feels like they get worse as I grow. I need answers. Can anyone help me?

Graveyard Shift,"California, United States",Misc,"I t was 9:00 at night and my friends and I were driving around, bored with nothing to do. My friend Julie came up with the idea of going to the cemetery that is near the highway. All of us agreed since we wanted a nightly scare of course. As we got to the cemetery, my friend who was driving parks in 7/11 since there is no parking at the cemetery. We all then walk a block or 2 to the cemetery. It was really dark and spooky. The air was really cold for a hot summer night but no wind was blowing. I started to get nervous and clutch on my friend Julie's hand.

All of us continue to walk in. As we were in the middle, we walked under one of the lights that kept the cemetery lit. After we were all done passing it, the light shuts off, and none of the others had before. My friends and I get scared and run to the other side of the cemetery that is near the open street. We start walking again thinking it was just the cemetery guards pulling a trick on us.

By the time we go under another light, the light shuts off and we run again all the way out of the cemetery. We then knew it was not a guard at all. After out of the creepy cemetery, the air gets warm again and we all walk back to 7/11. The guys soon said that they wanted to go back in and play cemetery tag but Julie and I refused to go. Julie and I waited for the guys to finish their game at the 7/11. It was almost 10 and Julie had to be home before then and so did some of my other friends. Julie called Jerry and told him the time. All of the guys came back besides Jason who was missing.

Jerry went back into the cemetery and found Jason, who drove everybody who had to go home. All was left was Jerry, Jason, and I. We soon all decided to go back to the cemetery, but I chickened out and said I would go back in if I had a flashlight. Jason then drives me home to get a flashlight. After grabbing 4 flashlights and extra batteries, I go downstairs and get into the car.

Back at the cemetery, we go under more lights and they keep turning on and off. It was really scary and the air was still chilly with no wind on a hot summer night. After walking the whole cemetery with all the lights turning on and off, even when we went near them, we decided to walk back to the car at 7/11. By the time the 3 of us were in the middle of the cemetery, a bright flashlight is shined on us. It turns out the bright light was a cop. She asked us what we were doing and as we walked out of the cemetery none of the lights turned on or off. Outside of the cemetery was another officer who was a guy.

The 3 of us got citations and Jason drove home while Jerry and I waited for my dad to pick us up. It was the last time my friends and I ever went to a cemetery at night. The most funny thing out of it was I couldn't get grounded since my dad was the one who gave me the flashlights. My other friends didn't get in trouble either.

Growing Up,"South Carolina, United States",Poltergeists / Physical Manifestations,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Poltergeists / Physical Manifestations :: Growing Up

I was brought up in the suburbs of Columbia, South Carolina in the 70's and 80's. Not a whole lot of ""spooky stuff"" going on but I would like to share what I do remember and recollect now as an adult.

I grew up in Irmo SC, in a middle class neighborhood that was just wonderful. We had a large colonial house that sat on pond front property. My family were the second owners of the house. Nothing really happened with the original owners, nothing that would cause a haunting.

My earliest memories of something being ""strange"" or ""off kilter"" were my experiences in the upstairs bathroom that my sister, brother and I used. Many times I would be taking a shower and ""feel"" something watching me. I was scared to soap up my hair in fear that I could not see! I never saw anything but things would move from one place to another in the bathroom during these showers. I knew something was going on but did not know what. I thought at first that my siblings were playing tricks on me. I thought that my missing or moved clothes were the antics of them. I found out one night that this was just not true.

The season was summer and my family was at a local swim-meet. My older brother and younger sister swam on the team. Not my thing in those days, I wanted to fish. And fish I did!

I came home to a empty house. The others were at the Meet. Here I was, dirty as you can imagine. I had mud all over my legs and on the shorts I was wearing. I kicked off my shoes downstairs in the ""mud room"" as Mom called it. This is where you put your dirty ""mud shoes"" when entering the house so as not to track it around. From here I headed upstairs to get a shower. Nothing strange... Not yet.

I walked into the bathroom, took off my shorts and laid them on a seat beneath a small window that looked over the back yard. I started the shower and got in. I must admit that the feeling at the time was making my nerves crawl but I ignored it. The warm water was refreshing and the soap smelled good as usual. Back then, Mom bought Prell to wash our hair with. I cleaned all the dirt off of myself and then washed again knowing how it would not all be gone after the first washing. Feeling clean and tired, I turned off the water and pulled back the shower curtain. To my amazement, my clothes had been moved. My shirt was on the floor and obviously moved from the chair. I grabbed a towel, and got out of the shower, curious as to what had happened. The bathroom door was open, and a small trail of mud led out from the tile work of the bathroom to the hallway. Keep in mind this is not a small bathroom, two sinks and a large toilet area.

I dried off and walked slowly out into the hallway. I looked to my left. Nothing out of the usual. I looked to my right and saw a muddy trail all the way down the wall to the bottom of the stairs. At the bottom, of course, were my shorts. It was as if someone had held my muddy shorts at arm level on the wall and walked all the way downstairs with them, leaving the trail behind. This would normally freak anyone out, but what do I do? I freak out knowing Mom was coming home soon and I would get my rear end worn out if I did not get this cleaned up.

I did my best to get the red mud streaks out of the wall paper but was unsuccessful. I was even more unsuccessful explaining the whole thing to Mom and Dad, as I am sure you can imagine.

Creepy & Abandoned,"Texas, United States",Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: Creepy & Abandoned

T his summer I became a believer. There is this creepy abandoned house right next to my friend's house. He said that a lady named Betty used to live there until she had a heart attack. After she died, all of her belongings were still inside the house and some people broke into it one day and stole some jewelry. There is also a big shed in front of the house with some stuff in there like photos, plates, a fridge, and even a couch. The first time I saw the house it was creepy, but I didn't expect much of it.

In June I went to my friend's house to hang out with him, but he wasn't there so I ended up hanging around with his cousin, whom I'm also friends with. We played airsoft with their neighbors and we decided to hide out in the ""Dead Lady's"" house as we called it. We went into the house. It was all warm and there was this weird musty smell in the house. He sat on the couch, while I stand. We talked for a bit and I sarcastically say ""What if this place was haunted?"" Then we heard stuff moving around in another room. That was when we got the hell out of there.

This wasn't the only weird thing to happen. When I told my friend, he said one time he saw a fan running from inside the house. There is NO electricity in the house. A week later we went back to the house and we shot the window with an airsoft gun. Then I pressed up in the window and the entire pane came crashing down. I came back there a couple days later to find that there were still portions of the glass standing. That house now scares the hell out of me.

"Picture of Ghost on the Parking Lot in Lake Jarun, Zagreb",Croatia,Photographs / Videos / EVP,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Photographs / Videos / EVP :: Picture of Ghost on the Parking Lot in Lake Jarun, Zagreb

I don't really have a story just a picture I would like to share with you. The picture was taken around 9.00 P.M., July 7th, on a parking lot in Lake Jarun, Zagreb, Croatia. Digital camera was used in order to capture the amount of cars parked on the parking lot behind a wedding hall. There was no one in front of the camera when the picture was taken and yet when the picture was reviewed a strange apparition manifested on it.

The shape became more clear as the picture was uploaded on the computer. When one zooms on the particular area in the middle of the picture one can see a strange apparition. It has a distinct and a transparent shape of a human being. It looks to me as if the person is naked and by the size - a man. It also appears that he was captured walking away from the camera. One might claim that it happened due to an exposition but that is hard to prove since no one was in front. I am not an expert so I would like your opinion.

The picture was taken randomly and if this is a ghost experience, I don't know anything about who it might be or the history behind it.

My First New York Encounters,"New York, United States",Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: My First New York Encounters

T his encounter happened when I was very young, probably under 4-5. I don't remember, but my parents have told me about it more than once. When I was young, my family (parents and me) lived in an old house in central New York. When I was young, I claimed to be talking to a friend, but my parents just brushed it off as my imagination. His name was Michael. They told me they were startled when I described my friend as being really dark, darker than anyone I had ever seen. At this point in my life, I lived in a completely white environment, and had never encountered African-Americans. Come to find out, we had been living in the part of the house that was used to hide escaped slaves on the Underground Railroad. Nothing else happened because we moved soon after.

My next encounter, years later (I was around 8 or 9), we moved into my Great Grandmother's house. She had passed recently. I often got the feeling of being watched. My bedroom had a window that looked out on the front porch. Once, I got really frightened because I woke up in the middle of the night and felt cold. I looked out my window and saw a pale old woman pacing the front porch. I didn't see her clearly, but I'm sure it was my grandmother. This happened a few times a week for a couple of months.

After this, the only encounters I had in New York were of being pulled off of my bed in the middle of the night once or twice. After that we moved to North Carolina, where I currently reside.

Our Apartment,"Pennsylvania, United States",Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: Our Apartment

H i all, I have written in the past regarding my Father's death and his presence in my life. Well, this time, I do not think he has anything to do with it.

My wife and I have been living in our first apartment for 5 months now. It's a nice place. It is on the first floor, has it's own entrance, and we have a nice little patio. The apartment is just not big enough for us and our dog, soon to be DOGS, so we will be moving when out lease is up in February.

Since we have moved in, my wife has had terrible night terrors and has been awakened by something more times than I can count. She will wake up and scream claiming she saw something standing by the bed or she will jump up and run for the door. (She ran for the door back in April and ran back to bed, all while asleep mind you, and slammed her leg into out bed's foot board. She STILL has a huge welt!)

I certainly believe in ghosts/spirits but I just never saw or heard anything out of the ordinary, so I just assumed it was the stress of the marriage and having our first place. Then, I started seeing things. I would like to say I had willed myself into seeing things but that is not the case. What tends to happen is I will see things moving out of the corner of my eye. Or, I will be in the bathroom in front of the mirror and I swear, I see thing reflected behind me.

There have been a number of occasions that I have been home alone during the day, I have been suffering from some health issues and have been out on leave, and things just don't seem right. Movements and sounds all over... Just odd. I would love to believe it is my illness playing tricks on me or just sounds from the other tenants but I am alert and the walls, floors and ceilings in our complex are solid concrete.

Another thing, our dog Murphy, a Jack/Boston, has been acting very odd. He will bark at invisible things, he gets VERY snippy with us when we try to pick him up... Which he never did before, and he has developed this tremendous fear of heat and smoke. Every time I am cooking or have the oven on, he hides in the computer room and sometimes will relieve himself on the floor. This is all new. And for some reason he will just not relax unless I am in the living room with him. If I am on the computer he will not stay in there with me. But when I go in the living room, he will just sit there.

Yesterday, as an example, I was in the computer room for a good amount of time. He would just walk back and forth until I was done in there. When I finally sat down on the couch, he was so exhausted from walking back and forth he fell asleep... Just odd.

"Mom, Are You Seeing Things?",Canada,Family / Friends Visits,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Family / Friends Visits :: Mom, Are You Seeing Things?

M y mother passed away almost 4 years ago (her anniversary is coming up, August 14th) and in the weeks before she died she was very medicated and she said and did a lot of things that could easily have been a result of the drugs she was taking to reduce the pain she was in. I am going to mention a couple of strange things that happened during this time, as they are very special.

My mother suffered a lot of anger, as she was taken from us quickly, and did not get a lot of time to experience the stages in which she needed to finally accept that it was her time to go. I had a scheduled trip to visit my boyfriend at the time in Ontario, I desperately wanted to see him as my heart was breaking, but I definitely did NOT want to leave my mother. She made me go, she told me I deserved it. As much as I didn't want to, I went reluctantly and did somewhat enjoy myself although I suffered many panic attacks.

I spoke with her every night, and I had to call them - I told all of my friends not to call my cellular phone as it's for emergencies only. My parents weren't even to call my cellular to chat, the only time that phone was supposed to ring was if I needed to get onto an airplane immediately to come home to be with my mother. She did quite well, but when I got back, she was painfully thin, and her skin was turning yellow. But she was happy - and it was different. She did not have a lot of strength, and things started to steadily go downhill for her. The only sound I lived by was the sound of her respirator, if I could not hear it, I could not sleep - so I slept on the upstairs landing living room couch. It was more of a decorative couch, and it was the most uncomfortable spot in the house, but I didn't care.

As her death approached, the more the drugs were injected into her as she was suffering a serious amount of pain from the Cancer. I was laying with her one afternoon in her room and she would just blissfully stare at the television and watch the pictures move back and forth with a tiny smile on her face and wait for her next Iced Cappuccino break (my father would bring her one at least 3 times a day, she always looked forward to it, she became very much like a little girl and she couldn't speak much, all she could do was whisper). All of a sudden I could feel something was wrong, I lifted my head from underneath her hand and looked at her. She wasn't looking at the television, she was staring directly into the corner of the bedroom. She gasped a tiny gasp and whispered ""Who's that?"" - she kept staring at the figure she was seeing. I started to ask her questions.

Me: ""Mom, are you seeing things?"" She nodded her head, quickly glanced at me, and then back to the corner. She whispered that it was a person.

Me: ""Do you know them?"" She shook her head a little bit and then cocked it to one side, and said ""I think so...""

I held her hand and told her it was okay, I told her it was probably someone she knew just coming to visit - to let her know that everything was going to be okay. She smiled, and kept staring at the figure with a little smile on her lips. About twenty minutes later, she sighed and resumed looking at the television.

I told my Dad about this experience, and he said it was probably the drugs, but he seemed quite perturbed by it. I asked him what was up, and he just said he's got things on his mind. I left him to it. Didn't think much of it until after the funeral.

The morning my mother died, I was laying at the foot of the bed. My parents bed is massive, my father would sleep on the right hand side and my mother on the left. I was sprawled out on the bottom and half on the bench thing they had set up at the end of the bed for the stupid dog. My father was laying next to her on top of the covers, still fully clothed, we had all fallen asleep listening to the rain the night before.

It was about 6:05 when I looked at the clock if I remember correctly, I had felt my mother's hand on the top of my head. My mother had a very distinct way of touching me, she was the only one who knew how to wake me up immediately (I'm serious, the actual house alarm wouldn't even wake me up, but there's a certain way she would touch me that would wake me up immediately) and I was shocked as this would have meant she was standing up next to me or something. I looked, and she wasn't on front of me, I looked behind me and she was still laying there on her side of the bed, but she was looking directly at me. There was NO possible way she could have gotten up and touched my head, but I knew somehow she did or someone did.

I looked at her with tears in my eyes, and I asked ""Mom, is it time?""

She nodded her head slowly, and I woke my father up, I ran to get the home care nurse and I grabbed my brother and was promptly right back by her side. I laid beside her and as she started to let go and her lungs filled with fluid, she gripped on to me - I grabbed her hair comb and started to brush her hair (her most favourite thing in the world was the sensation of someone else combing her hair).

My mother died in my arms that morning, and the moment she let go, I felt this overwhelming sensation come over me - as if she had passed through me. It was intense, and I will never forget it. Minutes after she passed, I desperately needed a cigarette as my adrenaline was pumping and I couldn't bare to be in the room any longer as she was no longer there. Her body was, but she wasn't. My father and I stood out on the deck and we'll never forget the sky - it was pink, and swirling. It was insane. I thought I was tripping on some sort of drug, but the fact that my father (and the neighbors reportedly afterwards told us as well) saw it. It was beautiful. A few hours later, the entire East Coast's power went out (which I just find coincidental and funny because she told me she was going to ""go out with a bang"" ha ha - she was awesome).

Many of my friends could tell you that from that day on for about 3 weeks, I was different, I wasn't myself. I remained the rock of the family - and even some family members will tell you that she was inside of me the morning she died as I said a lot of things that were out of character and don't really remember saying. One thing I do remember saying that utterly shocked me after it came out of my mouth was ""Mo, I don't want them to see my body"" - Mo is my father, and ""them"" would have been her sisters. I cried and ran downstairs to regain my composure. I have no idea where it came from, but it happened.

The day of the funeral was sad, but I rehashed the story of my mother seeing someone in front of my Aunt and my father. Turned out that THAT very day, very close to the same time my mother saw this figure, her Uncle (my Great Uncle) passed away in his sleep. And I think I was right when I said it was someone stopping by to let her know that she's going to be just fine. :)

House in Waco,"Kentucky, United States",Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: House in Waco

M e, my sister and mother/father, moved to this house in waco KY, my nieces lived right across from us. One night I was on the computer, and my sister, and two nieces were in our room. We had two rooms in one, and my bed was on the built on side, and they were all sitting on my sister's bed, which was on the other side. All of a sudden, I heard my name being yelled, I go and open the door, and they were all pointing to my bed. I looked over there, and the front of the bed was sunk in as if someone was sitting on it. They said they saw a young indian girl, holding a doll (waco used to be a indian ground). So I opened the door, and told them to get out, and we went to sit in the living room, but my mother said it was the pillow, were it had a hole in the middle. BUT the whole side of the bed was sinking.

There have been other things that have happened here too. Such as my uncle died here in our room, from a heart attack, my sister said when she would be laying down, she'd look over at the small fan and she'd see a figure looking down at her, she said that she suddenly got a feeling to say his name, and when she did, he bent over, and stretched out his hand, as if he was trying to touch her.

Another one that I have had, was in my mother's room, you'd get this AWEFUL feeling of a strong evil presence in her room, when the lights are off. But one night I got a different bed, and it was placed right next to my sister's, and I could see into the living room. From the kitchen to my mother's room, there is a small hallway, where mom has the washer and dryer, I was laying in my bed, and I saw a girl, standing right in the front of the hallways hunched over as if she was crying, right after that all the other experiences happened. It seemed like the whole house was being watched.

One night my sister was sleeping on the couch, and she was turned facing the wall, and she said she felt breathing on her ear, and neck. So she turned around and she saw a little black dog, she said it looked like it barked but she couldn't hear anything, and then it ran into the kitchen and disappeared. The next morning she drew what it looked like, and how it was sitting.

My sister also laid in her bed, and she'd listen to her cd player until she feel asleep. Well one night, she was laying there about to go to sleep, so she took off her head phones and laid it beside her, she said later she heard like the head phones being pulled up and down, making the ridged noise.

After 2 or 3 years here, my Granny was asleep in my room, I was in my bed. My sister was asleep on the coach, every time I woke up the door would be opened a little more each time, I woke up about 6 or 7 times that night, and when I finally woke up the last time it was completely open.

Also sometime at night, I got up to use the bathroom, and I opened the door, and it felt like someone was behind it and open it with me, it actually pulled me, this also happened with my niece.

One day I put a recorder at the end of my bed were the little girl had sat, and when we came to check on it later, it seemed to just shut off.

In my mother's room she would keep dolls above her bed and one night me and my niece were laying down watching t.v and the doll of a cowboy fell and the doll looked like it was staring right at us. The doll is still in the same spot, we never did touch it.

Once, my sister and my two niece, were in my mothers room, and my older niece just seemed to stop, and her arms were crossed around her chest, her hands weren't holding her arms to hold them in place though, and my sister was trying to pull them apart, and they wouldn't move, as if something was holding her.

Everyone has seen something like figures and faces and showdowns and we also hear things. I still live in this house today.

My Son's Ghost Story,"Georgia, United States",Children Who See Spirits,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Children Who See Spirits :: My Son's Ghost Story

T his story is about my son, as you may have read my other story After My Grandfather Died , this is about his grandfather. Well my son's grandfather (on his dad's side) died of a stroke when my son was only 4yrs old. My son was just the ""apple of his eye"", but it had been a while since they'd seen each other as we lived several hours apart. Several years after his death, my son was about 7yrs old at this time and we had moved out of state and in a new apartment. After his grandfather died, I had a portrait of the two of them enlarged. When we moved I had hung the portrait on his wall in his bedroom to remember him.

One day in this new apartment, I was laying in my bed. I work nights and so I sleep during the days of course. Well my son was home with me this particular day and so I was kind of in and out of my sleep, as his bedroom was right across the hallway from mine. My son was playing on his own and I kind of woke-up and looked to check the clock and it was the middle of the afternoon. As I woke I could hear my son talking to himself in his room. I didn't think much of it of course as he was only seven. All of a sudden I heard him kind of say something in a weird way and then I heard him ""jump up"" and he came running into my room. I said ""what's wrong baby"" in my usual motherly way. And my son says to me ""Mommy, I was just looking at grandpa's picture on the wall and I said Hi to him and he winked at me"". Of course that kind of spooked me out, and then I just tried to brush it off as the mind of a seven year old. Only my son has never forgotten that.

My son is now 12yrs old, and he still mentions his grandfather ""winking"" at him all those years ago. I never bring it up or mention it. But something must make him think about it from time to time and to this day, his story is always the same.

I don't know what to think of this story. I mean my son was only 7yrs old at the time and had no reason to lie. After all, I had been laying there in my bed and heard him when he jumped up and came running into my room. Something ""startled"" him that afternoon. I'm sure his grandfather was watching over him that day. Even now, we have moved into a new home, and just the other night we noticed a white glow on the wall in the corner of his room. We tried to find the source like maybe the lighting outside was reflecting off something. But everything we tried in the dark did not make this ""glow"" go away. Now my son sleeps with his lights and t.v. on every night.

I'd be interested in some feedback on what anybody else might think about this!

Grandpa is in the House!,"Texas, United States",Family / Friends Visits,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Family / Friends Visits :: Grandpa is in the House!

H i my name is Niki! What I am about to tell you is real and happening recently. When my family first moved in Texas, me and my mom where sitting in the dining room talking, all of a sudden my mom turns around and looks at me. Of course I asked her what's wrong she said, ""someone touched my shoulder..."" Well I looked around and didn't see anything, so that's when I started wondering. Now we live in that house and some strange things happen.

For instance, my mom was going up and down the stairs doing her laundry, then the third or fourth time she was going to the stairway, there were three of my dad's caps blocking the stairway. Every single night I hear ""go to sleep baby girl, don't let the bed bugs bite!"" It's very weird but I feel special because I never knew him.

Another night, my mom and dad were sleeping, they woke up to someone banging on their bed, they looked up and nobody was there! And every night I look out my door at 12:30am I see a thick black cloud of smoke. I just can't believe what is happening. If there is anybody, I mean anybody, please help me!

I just want a little bit of help here. I just want to find out what he want and why he hasn't crossed over. My mom thinks that my grandpa's dog is with him but I don't think so.

Tragedy of  the Black Bridge in Nashua,"New Hampshire, United States",Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: Tragedy of  the Black Bridge in Nashua

I n the early 1950's in the city of Nashua, New Hampshire, there was an incident at the black bridge which was located on a stretch of railroad tracks not far from the Hudson bridge, which is the next town over. My great grandmother, who lived directly across from the tracks, was present when a train derailed and crashed into a nearby building. The bridge was partially torn to pieces and many people died and almost all who lived were scarred for life.

My great grandmother told my father, when he was very young, that some of the passengers crossed the field to her house. Being a kindly women she did not turn them away and helped them. One man, according to great granny, had the skin of his back missing. But she said that he was in such tremendous shock that he did not seem to be aware of it.

Sadly, many children perished in the wreck. Many years later, me and my family lived on the street that runs down a long hill and comes to a stop at the black bridge. Me and my friends named it that because it was as black as pitch.

To this day, the laughter of young children can be heard, as though they are playing under the bridge but nobody is ever seen. Apparitions and the ghosts of suicides haunt the area as well. Go to the bottom of Lock Street and you will find out for yourself.

My Parents House,India,Apparitions / Voices / Touches,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Apparitions / Voices / Touches :: My Parents House

M y Parents house is located in a very sophisticated locality in india (Mumbai). It was built by my great grand father in 1936 i.e before indian independence. My great grand father was a lawyer and was employed by british but was secretly involved in the independence movement. So many meetings of the freedom fighters used be held secretly at our place.

And the real story begins now... It was in the year 1992, when I was 12 years old, my younger brother was suffering from typhoid - a type of fatal viral fever and was admitted to he hospital and both my parents were with him. I clearly remember it was 16th of july and was raining heavily outside and I was sleeping besides my grand mom. Some voices disturbed me, I could hear some one talking distinctly and now I could hear more than one person. I was shaken and got out of my bed, suspecting robbery. My grandmom woke up too. We both were frightened out of wits but gathered courage and went into the other room from where the noise was coming and peeped through the door. And to our horror, we could see 4 people in their late twenties, dresses in indian attire as they used to in 1930's / 1940's and as soon as they saw us they vanished. I passed out and my grandmom suffered a paralytic attack.

When I came to my senses, I was in medical car , and my grand mom in intensive care unit. She expired some years back but was in explicable to such things, until this date chills run down my spine. But never again anything happened like that.

My Father's Experience,Canada,Family / Friends Visits,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Family / Friends Visits :: My Father's Experience

M y father is really the only one I feel comfortable talking to in my family about paranormal and supernatural activity - as he has had his own experiences that have been just as intense as my own. He's shared with me a couple of quick experiences he's had over the course of his life and I would like to share them with you, the majority happening after my mother passed away of course.

1. His first and major experience was when he moved to Canada (from Scotland) - he was married to his first wife at this time, he was probably in his early twenties. His family and hers were still all over in Scotland. His mother had already passed, and one morning he was in his bedroom and he could not shake the smell of her perfume that he remembered as a child. He couldn't ignore it, he tried as he figured it was just memories and something triggering it but finally he sat down on his bed and asked ""Okay, Mum, what is it?"" then the phone rang. His sister was in the hospital. He had a similar experience again when his father passed away as he was overseas again far away from family, he was unable to make it to the funeral.

2. After my mother passed away, a few months later he started having visits with a lady that was honestly just his friend at the time (she became his girlfriend there for a while, but he can't bring himself to learn to love someone else yet - so now they are just best friends). He could feel the anger from my mother welling up, and he started to wash his hands. His wedding ring was seriously stuck on his finger unless you actually got some sort of grease on there to yank it off - so the fact that this happened is quite surprising. All of a sudden when he went to reach for the towel, his ring shot off his finger and landed in the middle of the bedroom. He could feel my mother's presence, he could feel her throwing a tantrum as she knew he was going for coffee with this woman. (My mother became very jealous when my father paid attention to anyone else in her old age, as she didn't feel pretty enough anymore - but my father would never have hurt her, and I know that completely, that man was so in love with her there's no possible way he could allow himself to touch someone else, my mother helped my father become who he is now). He said ""Okay, Ann, come on - you know it's nothing. Smarten up..."" He slipped the ring on his finger and tested it - stuck again. And the angry feeling he felt around him went away and the room cooled down again.

My father also experienced hearing my mother, feeling her lay down next to him in his sleep, or as he was drifting off. He's had conversations with her, and he feels her everywhere he goes. He feels her more often than I do now.

3. One morning I was not doing so good, I was extremely depressed, I was home alone and crying. I couldn't handle being alone at that time (grieving) and I had no one to call. About 15 minutes after I burst into uncontrollable tears laying in the spot where my mother passed away, my cell phone rang. It was beside me, I answered it and it was my father - ""Are you okay? Something's off and I don't know why, but I have a feeling it has something... Sweety, have you been crying?"" I confessed to him that I wasn't doing so hot and I needed to talk to someone. He came home promptly and told me his story.

He was standing outside having a cigarette talking to my brother, and something was distracting him. He described it as, ""you know how your mother was, remember? If she wanted you to pay attention to her she would literally get in your face? Remember?"" And she would. She would stand right in front of you until you asked her what the hell her problem was. And he couldn't shake it, he was trying to pay attention to my brother, but something told him inside that he absolutely had to make this phone call to me right away. So he excused himself and did, and low and behold - I was bawling my eyes out. This was a couple of weeks after she passed away in 2003.

Every now and again when I'm not doing so hot, I'll get that phone call - I got that feeling again, he'll say. She's around when things get tough, she's still looking out for me. I think that's totally awesome.

Scary Visit,"Arizona, United States",Apparitions / Voices / Touches,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Apparitions / Voices / Touches :: Scary Visit

I had a question and I was hoping to get it answered: My boyfriend has a friend he grew up with in school pretty much all their lives, he had ended up with another of their mutual friends and began dating, this friend of his just recently moved out and they both broke up, I really didn't get in to why, but he had always told my boyfriend that the house they were living in together was haunted. My boyfriend asked him ""well why do you say that"" and one of many occurrences, he finally couldn't handle it. He exclaimed to my boyfriend that the house they lived in together used to belong to her sister.

She was murdered there, actually her husband shot her with a shot gun before turning the gun on to himself leaving their son with no parents whom now lives with his grandmother. Aside from objects being moved and noises phones constantly ringing etc. He explained an instance where he had just had it.

It began one night when his girlfriend went out with her mom for the evening, he decided to stay home and head to bed early that night. As he gets comfortable to set in, he turns out the light and it is pitch black, pretty much but the glow from the digital light was bright enough to see a silhouett,e actually if you know what I am speaking of, then that small red light illuminates pretty good (those digital alarm clocks). As he was dozing off, he felt like a tug on the foot of the bed, more like someone sitting down, now his girlfriend had already been gone for about an hour at this point, so he figured it was her and she came home he decided to play asleep and scare her as he waited, acting asleep, he could see her coming toward the side of the bed which he was facing, right next to the clock so he could tell it was her (well a woman).

She stood there, he jumped up and yelled RAGGHHHH! And while grabbing her legs he felt her inner thigh, expecting her to scream, all he heard was a gasp like someone gasping for air then the shape turns around and walks calmly away toward the door, this in turn scared him, so he threw his pillow at her and shouted her name (dammit christine) so he jumped up and turned on the light to run out to the hallway. There was no one there, he searched the whole house, even outside but nothing, either way, he knew that whatever it was could have not gotten away that fast from the bed to the door.

He was so freaked out he couldn't even stop jittering. His Girlfriend finally came home, and was surprised at his behavior, but was not surprised at the story. But what gets me is that I am sure that whatever it was, was also surprised at how he unwittingly tried to scare it. I don't think it expected that as it gasps for air, anyway, what I was wondering is he asked ""how in the hell could I have felt it"" when I jumped up to scare who I thought was my Girlfriend? Can ghosts be touched like that?

It's Time To Go Now,"Texas, United States",Family / Friends Visits,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Family / Friends Visits :: It's Time To Go Now

W hen I was twelve years old, my great grandmother became very ill with colon cancer. She went through treatment in the beginning, but it was not working and she was at the age that she felt she was ready to die. Her husband had been dead fifteen years, so when she got sick, her 8 kids and their spouses took turns looking after her.

One night, my great grandmother took a turn for the worst so my grandmother called her siblings together to help make her mother in-law as comfortable as possible. She continued to hold on through half the night, then she asked to be alone. Her kids left the room and went to their separate rooms. At around 11pm, my grandmother heard her father's voice coming from my great grandmother's room. He said as clear as day, ""Its time to go now clarice..."" My grandmother rushed to the room and realized that her siblings were also there. They had all heard their father's voice and my great grandmother was dead.

To this day my grandmother will swear that this happened, and why would every other person in that house hear the same thing if it had not been real? My family is devout church of christ and to know that there is a place that we are ""going"" when we die is just another reason to have faith in heaven and our lord.

A Visit  from Teena,"California, United States",Family / Friends Visits,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Family / Friends Visits :: A Visit  from Teena

I have had many experiences with the paranormal. I have lived in houses that had spirits and have been able to see spirits since I was very young. It was only recently that I found out that I am what is called a sensitive. A lot of the experiences I have have not all been very nice ones. But the story I am going to tell now was a very nice one, it happened to my mother who has never been a believer in the paranormal, especially when it comes to loved ones who have passed on.

My sister Teena passed away on Mother's day of this year, May 13 , 2007. On june 26, my mother was scheduled for surgery on her heart and since we live 65 miles away from the Heart Hospital where the surgery was to be done, we decided it would be easier for she and I to stay the night before in a motel near the hospital, because she had to check in at 7:00 am the morning of the surgery. The next morning, my mother told me that the night before she had felt someone lie down on the bed next to her and snuggle up close. She thought it was me until whoever it was got up and left the bed. Mom looked over and saw that I was asleep and knew it wasn't me. She drifted off to sleep and again she felt someone lie down next to her, only this time they not only snuggled up against her, but they also put their arm around her and laid there until she went to sleep again. As she told me of her experience, I knew that there is only one person who would have come to her before she was due to have a major surgery and that was Teena, my older sister.

Even though she is no longer with us physically, she came to comfort our mother as she had so many times before. This experience has helped my mom to see that no matter which realm we are in, we can and do still come back to check on our loved ones and to give them comfort or just to let them know we are ok.

Weird Apparition,Mexico,Old Hags / Night Attacks / Sleep Paralysis,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Old Hags / Night Attacks / Sleep Paralysis :: Weird Apparition

I t's not an ""old house"", it isn't build over a cemetery... Neither was it a mental clinic before! I've been living in my house all my life... It all began one night, I felt asleep (let's explain how my room is: my bed is at one side foots to the door and one complete side is along the wall so that if you are laying, you have the wall on your left side and the door on your right side at your near your feet).

I suddenly woke up and turned my head away from the wall and saw ""someone"" entering to my room. The first thing I thought was ""it's my dad"" but no... This ""thing"" walked towards a side of my bed, squalled and stayed like that, just looking at me, I tried to turn to watch him better, but I couldn't and just heard him laughing, not an evil laugh, it was more like a silly or humorous laugh, after a few moments he just walked away from my room.

That repeated some more nights, until one night when I woke up, I saw him at my door, pointing at someone, or something outside and shouting at me ""he's there, he's there"" a moment later, I could feel something holding my neck so I couldn't breath, I was just lying on my back, feeling how I was sinking in my bed until I saw him trying to release me from that thing that was holding my neck.

I've never seen completely well that ""thing, shadow, person, phantom"" or whatever it is, but I can ""sense"" it's a man, but what is he doing in my house, why after all this years, why he suddenly appears and first laugh at me and then saves me from other ""something""?

Little Farm Boy,New Zealand,Misc,"L ast year, me and three of my school mates went to a little farm house owned by my grandfather's friend spotted near a town called Pairoa. It was quite a new house actually, nothing looked creepy about it. A day after we got to the house, we decided to help the old guy out on his farm. At lunch time, he told us a old story about wars between the Europeans and Native Maori tribes which took place right on the land where the old guy's house was. The story sounded pretty boring but he told us that a lot of people died at the very spot. Then he told us how he always saw a little kid running around in his crops at night, vandalizing his crops with a stick. He thought that the kid had a mental disorder because the kid didn't even care about three full grown farm dogs barking at him.

He got very upset with the kid, this time the kid was just a few meters away from his front gate standing close to one of the dogs that was tied up with a chain. He studied the kid for a long time, looking at him from the window. He noticed that he was looking right into the dog's eyes while the dog was barking at his face, and the kid didn't even back off or blink. So the old guy decided to step out of the front door and chase the kid away (the door was just a few steps away). As soon as he stepped out of the door and looked to the gate, there was no sign of the kid, but the dog was still barking its stomach out.

The old man was amazed. We decided to walk around the farm for the whole next day, just to see if we find something. At that night, me and one of my friends were both sitting outside on the front porch while other two mates were sleeping on the couches and the old man was sitting on the dining table and having whisky. It was about 8.30 pm when me and my mate got bored and started playing around on our laptops. Suddenly, I started hearing someone walking on the roof. I could hear the bending of tin sheets that were screwed on the roof. We got pretty scared because everyone was inside and sleeping except for us two. As soon as I got out of my chair to see what's on the roof, I heard a big thud on the ground which sounded like breaking bones. We both got alarmed by the sound and turned around, and we couldn't believe our eyes.

We saw the same kid lying on the ground. He looked just like a normal person. Besides, we couldn't see well at night but all I noticed was that he was wearing dark colored dungarees and a white shirt. We totally forgot about what the old man told us about the little kid, so we quickly jumped off the porch to see if he was ok. My mate was pulling my arm because he didn't feel right about this. I turned back and told him to stop fooling around and when I turned back within a second and saw the kid standing up like nothing happened, but half of his face was covered in blood. We didn't think for a second and ran back up the porch in terror. We ran in the house and dared to look out the window.

The little kid was standing there pulling a innocent face and the next moment he ran across the backyard in an extraordinary speed. It was hardly a second and he was out of there. After that, me and my mate couldn't talk but we drink heaps of water and didn't sleep in panic. We just sat on one of the couches and switched on the TV, trying very hard to get that sight of horror out of our heads. At about 3 in the morning the old man woke up. He walked over to us still in his hangover and asked us ""so, found anything yet""? I managed to laugh faintly and told the guy that you won't believe it. Then we told him what we saw and described what the kid looked like. He was pretty concerned and shocked at the same time now, and told us kindly to leave the next morning. So we did.

We didn't told other two of our smart arse mates who were sleeping last night because they wouldn't believe us anyway. It took us a couple of days to get back to normal.

My Experience with Demon Attacks,"Hawaii, United States",Old Hags / Night Attacks / Sleep Paralysis,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Old Hags / Night Attacks / Sleep Paralysis :: My Experience with Demon Attacks

O ne morning after a hard night of partying (before I became a Christian and learned how to deal with this), I awoke to the most horrible smell making me think that the sewer had backed up into my house. When I tried to move I could not! I tried to call for my brother but I could not speak either. I felt paralyzed so I laid there for what seemed like an hour before I could move again.

When I got up, I went looking for where that smell came from but could not find it, and no one else smelled anything. That was my first experience with the Old Hag syndrome.

My second time was after I became a Christian and I had just gone through a very heartbreaking divorce. I was awakened in the middle of the night by a horrible smell. When I awoke, I realized that I could not move a muscle, except that I could move my head a little to look around. And what I saw was the ugliest looking face hovering at the foot of my bed. It seemed to be laughing at me as it bobbed up and down in the air. I then tried to speak to it to leave my house but immediately realized that I could not utter a word. And that devil seemed to laugh at me even more.

So I laid my head back down on my pillow and prayed and asked God why I could not speak to cast this devil out and He said to me that I had sin in my life, that I need to seek His forgiveness for. So I did and as soon as I did, I was able to sit up on my bed and I told that spirit ""in the name of Jesus get out of my house"". And that thing rose up in the air with the most angry look on his face (for a moment I thought that he was going to charge at me) but it headed for my front door, and with one last look at me it flew off.

I have helped others who have had these encounters and I hope that my story here may be able to encourage others who are having these kind of problems that there is hope and help with this.

Give Us Signs,Philippines,Psychic / Medium,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Psychic / Medium :: Give Us Signs

I have this office mate (brian) who claimed that he have a friend who has an opened-third-eye. Let's just call her bianca. Bianca has been seeing dead people, roaming souls, ghosts... Or what so ever she want to call them.

This happened one night in intramuros manila or usually known in the philippines as ""the walled city"" during the spanish regime. Intramuros have been a prison cell for ""katipuneros"" (filipino army) who were captured by the ""guardia cibils"" (spanish army). Many was beheaded, hanged, shoot to death and starved to death. So it is a popular haunted place among us. Intramuros now was developed, opened to public and housed several popular schools in the philippines. It just so happened that Brian used to study in one of those schools.

Brian and Bianca had a night class. Their class ended around 8:30 pm. There are no transportation means available inside intramuros around that time so they decided to walk. Brian, Bianca and some of their friends where telling stories while they walked inside the walled city, when suddenly Bianca fell silent and said ""shh...stay quiet, there's a group of katipuneros heading towards us..."" (""shh...wag kayong maingay, may makaksalubong tayong mga katipuneros""). They didn't believe her. Of course, katipuneros and guardia sibils doesn't exist anymore, it has hundreds of years ago.

So Bianca made a deal ""since you wouldn't believe me... I bet you... Every time we pass by a lamp post, it will shut down"" (""tutal ayaw niyo maniwala, pustahan tayo, lahat ng madadaanan nating poste, mamamatay""). Brian and the rest, though somewhat doubtful agreed to the bet.

They stopped talking and continued walking waiting for the unbelievable to happen. As they passed by the first lamp post, it flickered and eventually died, then right after they passed it, it opened again. The same routine happened until they reached the gate of the walled city. When they came out, all of them are speechless and none of them would want to go home alone.

Laying in Bed 2,"New Jersey, United States",Misc,"I f you haven't read my other experience , which was in the last week of June, I had another. After not being able to sleep since that night because of feelings of being watched and strange feelings of emotions of sadness, I went and bought a crucifix and a cross to wear while I slept. Things were going well since then until last night.

I was having a dream about work (I usually dream about work). I was talking to my assistant in the dream when all of a sudden she looked behind and began to scream in horror. I woke up from that but, this is the insane part, I woke up above my bed falling down into it. I was in a ball when it happened. My arms were wrapped around my knees like I was doing a cannon ball but going side ways (I sleep like that sometimes when I'm cold).

When I hit the bed it was loud. But instead of springing upwards I stayed embedded into the bed. I was being held very strong unable to move. Wind was rushing into my face and ears (no windows were open). I was scared out of my mind. I prayed to god and it stopped right after that. It only lasted about 15 seconds. Now I just moved into this house almost a year ago (August 21st).

Is it haunted do you think? Or am I dealing with something else?

The Swimming Ghost,"Colorado, United States",Apparitions / Voices / Touches,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Apparitions / Voices / Touches :: The Swimming Ghost

I t's normal for me to go swimming a lot over summer. Yesterday though had to be the most fun even though there were barely any people there. I decided that I would start swimming back and forth in the pool to make me get used to holding my breath longer. I was halfway to the shallow side and I felt someone brush against my leg. I didn't have goggles, so I couldn't see who was there. When I moved my head out of the water, nobody was nearby. I guessed that it was a ghost because they appeared often near our neighborhood and most of the ghosts I encountered were friendly. I just kept swimming.

A while later, again near the same spot, I felt someone kick me on the same leg as last time. Again, nobody was near. This was really interesting because I didn't think that ghosts would really go swimming. I never got to see or feel it swimming before because I always hung out on the deep side doing flips and jumps. Also, the water always seemed cooler than most days and in some spots warmer and in some spots cooler. It was so cool! The thing is, sometimes I can feel that someone is watching me or feel it sometimes. Maybe it's watching over me or something.

This happening told me that ghosts can appear in the most unexpected places from the pool or anywhere else.

The Old Civil War Hospital and the Old Indian Burial Ground,"Virginia, United States",Psychic / Medium,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Psychic / Medium :: The Old Civil War Hospital and the Old Indian Burial Ground

W ell Hello Everyone! When I was 14, I had a friend who experienced a lot of supernatural experiences. She used to tell me she experienced them both in her dad's house and her mom's house and once before she moved to the houses she previously lives in. When she was 3, she used to see her dead grandfather near the swing set in her backyard. When her mom asked her what she was doing, she replied, ""I was playing with Grandpa..."" Her mom was a bit worried and told her to come inside. Nothing happened for a while after that until she moved into her mom's house which was an old Civil War hospital.

The old Civil War hospital had a lot of strange happenings. One time my friend told me that she saw some of her dead cats and sometimes dead people. When I asked about the strange happenings my friend replied that she had one more story for me. She told me that every night something would bang the middle of her door at midnight and then it would go away. She never investigated this until I wanted to help. I was a bit to scared to spend the night with her but I said I would go and see her room in the day.

When we were there, I felt like there was something in the house. I had never seen a ghost or felt a presence before, but now I was sure that something was in her house. I decided to help my friend by figuring out how to stop this knocking on her door at night. I told her to try to talk to the knocking and say, ""Hey is there anyone there?"" After she did that the knocking stopped and the appearances began. Every once in awhile a ghost of a girl about age 7 would show up at my friend's house. Of course I still have never seen a ghost because I was too scared to spend the night at her house when these appearances showed up, but I do believe my friend because her brother saw them too. He was not a fibber, he would not lie.

So  this little girl would go around the staircase in her mom's house at night when my friend was doing homework. When the ghost showed up, we decided she needed a name. My friend told me to think of a name, so I did. I came up with the name Cecilia because the ghost was Silly and the Sillia was a little lame. So I told my friend the name and one night she asked the ghost who started to knock again if her name was Cecilia and the ghost said, ""No, that's my mom's name. My name is Annie..."" After that, my friend continued to talk to her about stuff, much of it I don't remember.

The one thing they talked about was becoming friends. My friend asked Annie if she wanted to be her friend and Annie said yes. After about three weeks or so, the little ghost Annie told my friend she had to go and thanked her for being her friend. This was a bit creepy because during that time at my house, which was a few houses down, I was always feeling a presence in my basement room at night. I don't know exactly what happened at my house but all I know is that I knew something was there and it went away when the ghost in my friend's house left. Maybe it was Annie? I don't know.

My friend experienced supernatural events after the ghost left at her mom's house, by the way.

My friend experienced a lot of different Indian appearances at her dad's house near the West Virginia border. Once she was pushed into the water when she went to the creek near her dad's house. The creepy part is that she was alone! After being pushed, she saw an indian male across the creek and she ran. She saw at least three other indian ghosts near her dad's house. I wonder if that had anything to do with her being 16% indian? I don't have a clue.

My friend had many stories that she shared with me when we lived near each other. She experienced white blobs and lots of ghosts. It was fun to hear about the ghost Annie that I helped. She probably needed a friend before she could go home, and a friend she got!

Evil or Prankster?,"California, United States",Apparitions / Voices / Touches,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Apparitions / Voices / Touches :: Evil or Prankster?

R ecently I flew to he north part of my state to visit my best friend, Evona. Her mom is in a wheelchair so they have a long ramp to the door of their home. There is a medium size porch attached to the ramp too. Her dad is a truck driver so he isn't home on weeknights. Her Uncle Jay was staying with Evona, Jenna (her mom) and Hannah (Evona's little sister) because he was also in town.

Everyone was getting ready for bed and I locked the front and back doors and we went to Evona's room. Her room is in the very back of the house by the way. Jay was sleeping on the couch in the living room and at the other end of the house was Hannah and Jenna's rooms. We talked for about an hour and fell asleep after going into her room.

About three in the morning I woke up suddenly to something staring at me through Evona's window. It had to be really tall to see into the top of that window the way it was so I was petrified. ""Eve!"" I whispered. She woke up and saw it too. We jumped up and ran out of her room and saw Jay standing in the front doorway with a gun. ""Girls,"" Jenna said. ""Someone's on the front porch and beating on the door and windows..."" I nearly fainted right there. Everything calmed down a little but Evona and I decided we were sleeping on her mom's floor.

When we went into Evona's room, something was hitting the window. It was like someone was knocking. ""Girls get in here!"" Jay yelled suddenly. When we got to the living room we saw a dark figure standing in front of the window staring in at us. It was the same thing we had seen in Evona's room. Jay thinks that it was a spirit playing a prank on us but it seemed evil. Evona and I both got that same feeling.

Does anyone have any ideas about what this was? Evona called a few days ago and said it happened again.

My Dead Cat - Young & Lively Again,"Connecticut, United States",Pets / Animals,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Pets / Animals :: My Dead Cat - Young & Lively Again

I n 1994, I had the rare privilege of adopting a purebred Russian Blue cat. The breed is known for its intelligence, loyalty, and stubborn streak. By January, 2007, she was in full-blown chronic kidney failure, and deaf. IV fluids kept her healthy until this past week. I made the decision to euthanize her when she stopped eating and began to withdraw. Usually she demanded eye-contact and was very people-oriented, but hid her head and wanted no cuddles at all.

Combined with 3 days of no food and constant vomiting, the decision was easy - save her from having to shuffle in pain out of this world. I took her body home with me Tuesday morning. By Tuesday evening, I had a lively 3 or 4 year old cat bound through my home (she had died at 15-1/2). She jumps on my bed and pushes my feet out of the way, zooms up and down the stairs, and generally hangs out with me or my roommates. We don't see her per se, but we catch movements in the corner of our eyes and see flashes of cat shaped movement on the stairs. This is no demon entity, just my dear pet refusing to go to her rest. It isn't particularly scary, and we are getting used to the idea. The running joke is to reassure ourselves that there IS no cat in the house. We laugh and say yeah, right, and watch the flicker twist around our ankles just like she did before her body died.

Having a ghost cat isn't so bad. After all, it saves on pet food and cat litter. And vet bills.

About the passing itself: I was puzzled about her death, because it was so unlike my last cat. My little orange half-Siamese was put down and click! The lights were out, he was gone. He had been with me for nearly 7 years, was a mellow, sweet fellow, and he just turned off. I took his body home and nothing ever happened, though he was a kind and loving pet. With this one, the vet, the vet tech, and I all felt that someone left the room - Elvis has left the building indeed.

The room was emptier, I guess, as though a fourth person had left.

Ghost Cover Up!,"New Jersey, United States",Apparitions / Voices / Touches,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Apparitions / Voices / Touches :: Ghost Cover Up!

I always believed in the supernatural and was ready to listen to anyone's story, they were exciting and interesting in a scary way.

Never thinking I would be witness to an event, I put all those stories out of my mind. But never say never!

My event happened in 1970, in January a couple of weeks before I had my first child. We had just moved into a two family house our friends purchased from an estate. It was an older house and of course, creeky. I wasn't scared but anxious, we removed some of her belongings to make room for our new things.

I decided to lay on the bed for a rest, my husband was watching TV three rooms away. I drifted off to sleep, suddenly I felt the blanket move over my body, thinking it was Bill, I opened my eyes. There was a elderly woman covering me up very gently, her image was so clear, not spirit like. I was so startled, I ran into the living room and asked Bill if he was in the bedroom covering me up, I just couldn't believe what I saw, of course his answer was no.

The event happened so quickly, just a flash, but I can picture it clearly as if it was yesterday.

We found out the woman's bedroom was set up like ours and her name was Helen, just like mine. Seeing is believing!

The Quarantine Station Tour,Australia,Ghost Tours & Haunted Hotels,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Ghost Tours & Haunted Hotels :: The Quarantine Station Tour

L ast night, I went on a quarantine station tour. It opened in 1830. Our tour guide said it's unlikely that we would have an experience with a ghost there, but I DID! I had a few.

We were heading to the quarantine stations hospital to go have a look inside. As we were looking inside, I felt a large, painful prick in my leg. It almost stopped me from walking. I asked the guide what it was and he said that it was a needle.

My next experience was when we were down where the ships used to dock. I was listening to the tour guide when something tapped me. I turned around... No one was there. The tapping started straight away after I turned around. It was pretty fast tapping. Like some one wanted me. That freaked me out!

My third one was when our guide was talking about a ghost Chinese man seen on rare occasions. No one saw him that night, but I did... That was a secret I didn't tell anyone that night. He had a coolie on top and he was wearing one of those Chinese gowns. He had a black pony tail hanging over his shoulder. I almost cried when he pointed to me and then disappeared. I didn't want to tell anyone because I was worried he would haunt me.

My last experience was when we were in the old shower room. I heard a shower turn on. I was wondering why no one else was alarmed. And I knew it wasn't my head, because after I heard the shower turn on, the tour guide said that once the showers turned on when they were not connected.

That made me TOTALLY believe in ghosts. Now, I hope that my house isn't haunted!

Stones at the Borley Rectory,United Kingdom,Poltergeists / Physical Manifestations,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Poltergeists / Physical Manifestations :: Stones at the Borley Rectory

I have been to borley rectory about 6-7 times. Nothing ever happened until me 6th time. We went into the church yard to explore, when I heard something drop near me, about 5 feet away. At first I thought it had stared to rain. I ignored it. It then happened again, only this time I saw it, a stone appearing from nowhere dropped next to me. I shivered with the thought of what it could be.

This happened a lot, getting worse. All around the church. The back being the worst. To this day I have no idea what was throwing the stones... Local residents seemed distant. Stones were falling regularly, near and around me. Some small, some very big. I also thought I heard footsteps but I'm not sure. I stayed for about half an hour, and about 30 stones fell. 2 actually hitting me, around my feet. I kept a stone, a small white chalky stone. I still have it now. Although the colour has gone.

Whether I will go back to the church or not I have yet to decided, although I can say that borley rectory is a very very strange place to be. Cold patches around the church, noises, and strange residents. I want to take others the the see it all. Hopefully soon I will go back there. And hopefully it will happen again

Fear of the Unknown,Ireland,Family / Friends Visits,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Family / Friends Visits :: Fear of the Unknown

M y mum's sister, who was called Jeannie, always used to tell my cousin and I ghost stories when we were little. The thing was they weren't made up, they were real. When someone in our family was going to die, my aunt Jeannie used to see a Banshee, what she saw was a little woman dressed in black and as far as I can remember, the Banshee cried. My aunt saw this every time someone in the family died.

When my own mum died, she told my dad that she had seen the Banshee, but what she couldn't understand was that she saw 2 Banshees. A week or so after my mum passed away, my aunt Jeannie's grandson was in a car accident and died, hence the two Banshees. She always knew when death was around, she said a cold hand would touch her or she felt death, it never seemed to scare her, just everyone else.

I have had a few strange experiences. When my best friend Mandy passed away suddenly, I went to melbourne for her funeral, I stayed at my niece's house. The first night in Melbourne I went to bed and was woken in the early hours of the morning by someone in my bedroom, I thought it must have been my niece looking for something, but I thought to myself, who in their right mind would be looking for something in the dead of night in the dark, I just started feeling uneasy, when I felt like someone had sat down on my bed beside me and put their hand on me. I got a real fright and jumped out of bed and turned the light on and it stayed on for the next few nights that I stayed in Melbourne. I know if it was Mandy, I should not have been frightened but I was, death does scare me and every time it happens to someone I know, I am scared that I am going to see them, why I don't know, because as my mum and dad used to say to me, it's not the dead you should be scared of.

The Haunted House,United Kingdom,,"T his is not a Halloween story but it might has well be. My aunt used to live in this part of Gilford that was kind of out in the country. Next to her house is an old cemetery. Also, about half a mile from her house is an old house, and my brother, cousins and I are convinced it's haunted.

It's made of a reddish brick, and has shutters that are all closed up, and those black, pointy, fence looking things on the top. There were never any lights on or people around. One day, my brother, my cousins, and I decided to go check it out. We figured we'd walk around the back yard for a few minutes and then leave. That's what we did at first. As it turns out, there was a huge, old barn

next to it, and a field. There was an outhouse, too and even one of those things that opens up to a cellar! The door of the shed was open, and it was kind of swaying in the wind. We couldn't resist. My brother went first, and we followed him into the shed. There was another door, and we saw that this door went INTO THE HOUSE!

We tried opening it, but it was jammed. Then my cousin saw that it was open about an inch. We pushed on it together and it flew open. I don't know why but we all started screaming and ran out into the yard. I couldn't believe we actually did that. We were just going to go home, but then we thought that we would be wondering forever what would have happened if we hadn't gone in there, so we went back. We were soooo scared. The first room looked like a kitchen, and it had one of those really old stoves, the kind that sits on the ground with a black pipe going through the ceiling. That was my first indication that this house could have been, like, a hundred years old. The floor was starting to creak, which made me say out loud that what if it gave out and we fell down into the cellar? That made my cousin almost start to cry but we calmed him down. We walked cautiously through the house.

There were a lot of small rooms. We didn't dare go down to the cellar. The front door was locked, and bolted and nailed down with boards, as were all of the windows. Did I mention that during this whole thing, we were all REALLY REALLY scared? Well, we were just about to head back, when my brother saw... A staircase. An old, brown, winding one. OH MY GOD. We discussed whether or not to go up (my brother was the only one who would, but I didn't want him up there alone with the ghosts!) He said he would only go up a few steps to see if he could see anything up there, so we let him.

And that's as far as he got. He was on about the 5th step, when we heard a horrible crashing sound from the kitchen. We all started screaming, and ran out of there fast. We didn't bother to shut the door - which was probably our first mistake. We ran back to my aunt's house, past the cemetery. At the time, the only person we told about this, was my aunt. She's cool, and we knew she wouldn't tell anyone what we did.

Well, my brother and I eventually had to go home, but this is where it gets weird! The next day, my mom took us back to my aunt's (my other cousin was going back home to Chicago the next day, and we wanted to see her again before she left). As we drove past the cemetery, I saw something really creepy. There were some men working there, and it looked like they were DIGGING A GRAVE. Now, I don't know if they still used that cemetery, I always thought it was too old to be burying new people there, but we were wondering - were they burying something - or digging something up?

We told my aunt about it right away, and she said that there had been a FIRE in the cemetery the night before. Now this was too weird. All of this stuff happened the day after we went there. There were now ""no trespassing"" signs all over the yard, which meant - someone saw us in there. We don't know who, but all I kept thinking was, what would have happened if my brother had gone upstairs? I guess we owe our lives to that thing that fell in the kitchen!

Who Was It?,"Illinois, United States",Apparitions / Voices / Touches,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Apparitions / Voices / Touches :: Who Was It?

M y aunt, Tia Ramona, came to visit. She is from mexico. She was sleeping downstairs in the basement while I was sleeping in my room. My room is right next to the kitchen, close the the basement door. For some reason I woke up around 8:35 in the morning. But when I woke up, I had this really weird feeling. I don't know why. I had knots in my stomach. So I was awake for like 15 minutes when all of a sudden, I heard her running up the stairs from the basement. Since I heard someone running up the stairs from the basement, I was thinking that it was my Tia Ramona. But why was she running? Did something happen down there?

I heard her desperately trying to open the door. She seemed nervous. She finally did open the door. So she started running really fast. And me thinking it was my aunt, I said,""Tia?"" but no response. I saw someone running passing my room. It was a shadow. It was like the figure of a man. Wide shoulders, tall. He ran so fast. But I didn't see his face. He passed my parents room making a big noise. And he slammed the door from the living room going upstairs.

I couldn't go to sleep. I was confused. I didn't know why my tia was running like that. Then around 10 in the morning my mom finally woke up to make breakfast. I went to the kitchen. I told her why Tia Ramona was running. She said that she didn't hear anything even though that thing made a lot of noise when it was running. So then I was like ok... I was getting really spooked and I had goose bumps.

I even told my dad if he heard any noise but he said no. Then my tia ramona opens the door from the basement.

Me: ""Tia I thought you were upstairs. You were running and you were rushing to open the door. What's wrong?""

Tia Ramona: ""What are you talking about? I was dead asleep. I didn't wake up until now. You know I can't run with my knees...""

Commercial Ghost,"Missouri, United States",Misc,"B efore I begin, foul language is hard to avoid for my experience because it is essential to the actual dialog, I have abbreviated words that are not allowed. I have only experienced what I believe to be a ghost only once when I was 12 years old. My old house had a finished basement which my brother (10) and I used as our play room.

Foul language was very discouraged in my house so my brother and I would cuss as much as possible when my parents were not around, cussing at the TV was normal for us (we were weird kids).

One night while playing and watching TV in the basement with my brother, a toothpaste commercial came on. I cannot remember the brand of toothpaste, but I do remember everything else. The woman was talking about how the toothpaste was good for her family's dental hygiene and how it was changing their lives. My brother burst out ""F*ck your family b*tch!"" I started to laugh but the woman on TV looked straight at him and said ""Excuse me?!"". At this point we still thought that something might be happening with the plot of the commercial that would make her say that and I chimed in ""Your an ugly w*hre"" to make my brother laugh, but to my horror the woman then turned and glared at me and sternly asked where our mother was.

Now, I would like to say that we had a come-back, but honestly we both just froze and stared at the television. The woman looked down and began to cry, holding her hand over her mouth and glancing at us, she suddenly looked like a worn out, beaten woman and the shiny, commercial lighting was gone, for lack of a better way of explaining it, she looked 'real'.

This all happened within about 30 seconds, then the commercial ended. I remember my brother cried afterwards and I told him to settle down, we were glued to the TV for hours after to see if the same commercial would come on again and this time we wouldn't say anything to see if it was just a coincidence, but it never came back on.

I'm not saying it was a ghost, it could have been a coincidence, but I know I never saw that commercial again and my brother and I both vividly remember it and bring it up often. Thanks for the chance to share my story.

They Tried to Strip the Joy From Me,"Alabama, United States",Orbs / Lights / Mists,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Orbs / Lights / Mists :: They Tried to Strip the Joy From Me

T his happened on July 14th, 2007. We had just finished up with a youth revival at my church. This night God had called for a prayer line for everybody under the age of forty in the church. We experienced a great move of Him that night. I gained a lot of joy that night too. I felt good about myself and stronger in my faith than I had ever felt.

Well that night when I got home, I was fine. I got on myspace and was talking to friend. I went to bed around 11:40 p.m. I wasn't very sleepy so I decided to watch a movie. When the movie went off around 1:40 a.m. I turned off the television and my lamp, rolled over and faced the wall, and closed my eyes.

I guess no longer than five minutes after I did that, I heard something in the corner behind my t.v. that started from the ceiling and fell. It sounded like something sort of scratching against the wall. Then I felt something against my hip. It felt like something lightly thumped me. Before I go on, I need to describe the layout of my room.

My bed lays in the corner of my room between two windows on either wall that it is touching. One window faces the road the other the woods. Well I had my eyes tightly shut and at this point I didn't want to open my eyes or even move though I was shaking.

The next thing that happened was I saw lights though my eyes were shut. First I saw two lights from the corner of my room just slightly past the window that faces the road. Then I saw another coming straight across to my face from the wall. If you have ever had someone shine a flashlight in your eyes while they were shut then you know what these lights looked like. The whole time these things were occurring, I just felt like there was something evil in my room. I finally opened my eyes and got out of my bed. As soon as I got out of my room, I felt much better.

I went and crawled in the bed with my parents and I was still shaking. I now have two prayer clothes in my room. I later found out that demons had been attacking all of our youth. Most of our youth sit in one area of our pews in the church and I found out that one of the girls in their youth had seen a demon circling that area.

The next day when I finally told my mother, she went in there to pray and got goose bumps walking down the hall. I shook every time I went down way. By that afternoon, I was afraid to go in there anymore but that night I didn't want to sleep in there. My mom stayed in there with me until I fell asleep.

Tonight I still don't want to go in there but I have. I ask for your Prayers for our youth at WCOG please. We need it as we are trying to grow like God has promised us.

Red Eyes,Canada,Non Human Entities,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Non Human Entities :: Red Eyes

M y mother had recently told me of something strange that happened to her when she was a teenager. She was walking home alone in the summer and it was almost dark out. She was walking on a dirt road and there was lots of trees around. My mother said, she suddenly, saw these red eyes starring back at her through the edge of the woods! She also said, she could see its face! Whatever it was... Was not human! It was really a frightening experience! She just ran back home and looked back a few times to make sure it wasn't following her!

It didn't follow her. She had told her mother and father and only her father believed her. There was some neighbors living near by and my mom's mother told their son this. He then told her, ""You shouldn't let your daughter walk alone on those lonely roads at night! There's some strange things happening in those woods!"" He said he once saw something but never said whatever it was he had seen.

My mother believes it was something from another world. She never went walking alone again. Apparently, it was not known what it was back then or even today. Any responses on this story is okay. I thought I would share this true event and thanks for reading...

Knockings at the Bedroom Door,"Virginia, United States",Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: Knockings at the Bedroom Door

H ow do I explain what I experienced this morning. My nerves are still shot, but I will try. I spent the night at my boyfriend's house. We had just went to bed around 2.am last night. We left the door cracked so his cat would be able to come in or out. We set the alarm on his cell phone to wake us up at 5.am to unlock the front door of the house. His sister was working a night shift (6pm-6am) and she needed a way in. I woke up to the alarm going off at exactly 5:00 am. I woke my boyfriend, and he proceeded to get up and unlock the door. He then went to the bathroom. His cat was sleeping like a rock beside me.

It only took several minutes, he shut the door, and jumped back into bed. I happened to turn my head and look at the clock in his room, it was only 5:04. All of a sudden I heard two loud knocks on his bedroom door, and the door started to slowly open. BEING half asleep I assumed it was his sister. BUT I started thinking, she didn't get off until SIX! I nudged my boyfriend. Suddenly his cat wakes up and starts meowing at the door! The cat jumps on the shelf next to the open door, and the cat's cries get louder. My boyfriend touches my shoulder and whispers in my ear. ""I don't want to scare you but I think someone is in the house! Someone just reached out and touched cooper (the cat), and knocked!"" I completely frozen.

I figured we were going to get killed, mugged, or whatever else. The cat runs through the house meowing at whoever it is. My boyfriend got up, and I followed. We hid behind the NOW open door in his room. We jumped from behind the door and ran toward his sister's bedroom which had a revolver, and a 38 in the closet. As soon as we hit the room mwe slammed the door, and we heard a very loud RUNNING and beating through the house. Thank god I grabbed his cell phone. He called 911 and a police officer arrived within minutes.

He searched the house, and found nothing! His sister arrived shortly after and him and her searched the house again! Found nothing! How did someone run in our house within the 3 mins of my boyfriend unlocking the door and using the bathroom. His cat is scared of everyone but me and his sister. Why did the cat run after something, or someone? If it was someone robbing us, why would they knock, and they didn't take anything!

I am so freaking scared. I have to go to work today and I haven't had any sleep. I can't sleep. I honesty believe in ghosts now. I have never been so scared in my life.

Early Memories,"Ohio, United States",A Haunted Life,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: A Haunted Life :: Early Memories

T his story is a two part both taking place in my childhood. As I said before I've experienced things as long as I can remember, which my memory is quite extensive. The first part took place in a town called brilliant. My family and I lived in a duplex when I was two years old up until I was three. Yes, I know some don't start containing memory until after this age but not in my case. I guess you could say it is because of the type of memories.

It was morning and my mother was hassling with my older sister to get ready for school, my sister's worst nightmare you could say. My sister and I shared a room at the time. I was playing in our up stairs bedroom while Amy (my sister) was fixing her hair. She finished quickly and left he room. As she did the bedroom door slammed shut and locked with me still inside. Now being only two years old, I was unable to reach the door handle to help myself. I immediately started screaming and crying. My mother rushed up he stairs to the door with my sister at her side. My mom automatically assumed that Amy had locked me in the room because of her rotten streak. My mom quickly got a screwdriver and was trying to pry open the heavy wooden door to get to me, but the lock wouldn't budge.

There was never a key to that door either. Ten minutes passed of my screaming and my mother trying to get the door free. All of a sudden, as I sat there on the floor waiting the lock just flipped open with no explanation as to why. The door swung open. My mother had a look of surprise on her face. She was still on her knees trying with the screwdriver. Till this day my mother says it was my sister who locked the door but I know better. The question is if something locked me in there why did it let me out or was it something else?

After that day I remember talking to things my mother said weren't there. One in the basement and one in my room. I can't remember exactly what I all said to these things. I just remember one sentence that scared the living day lights out of my mother. While standing close to the basement door which was in the kitchen, where my mother was with me, I said ""mommy I don't wanna help with laundry because the man behind the steps will get me"". Also I remember in the mornings that I was let out of my crib by someone that wasn't seen by anyone else. My mother would always wonder how I got out so she watched me one morning.

She tells me the story today of how I was sleeping soundly as the crib door gently slid down. I awoke five minutes later and climbed down the bars and was on my way to breakfast. All my life I have encountered these things and still do. For all the moms out there that believe their child has an imaginary friend think again.

Some call me tortured, some call me blessed, but to myself I'm just trying to live with the images I've seen. As I stated in the first part of this, I've seen things and remember since the age of two. This story takes place at the age of five in a place called Salt Run Road. I was living with my family in a large trailer. I say this because it was quite large and extravagant for being what most would call a trailer. It was late on a summer night and it was bath time for me. I always enjoyed bathing in my parents master bathroom due to the large tub. For most kids bath time was horrible but for me I saw it as immense fun.

I was in the tub mucking around with bubbles and bath toys. My mother was in the kitchen finishing up the dinner dishes and was in no way visible to me or vice versa. To give you an idea what the bathroom was like for later in the story, it was a large room with a spa tub and a standing shower on the other side of the room. Now when you would walk into this bathroom the shower is behind the door to come in and the tub to the far side.

In the midst of my bath I happened to look toward the shower. I was frightened out of my mind at what I seen. The shower curtain began to draw back by a set of fingers that looked as if they were burned. Almost like a hotdog that was made on the grill. Now everyone knows that a hotdog if cooked too long it has flaky burnt pieces on it. The fingers I saw had the same effect but ended with long nails. As the curtain went further to reveal the figure behind I began to scream for my mother. I could indeed see that it was a woman with a strange glow around her.

It took my mother a few minutes to hear my screaming due to the distance away. She finally heard me and came running in to the bathroom. I'm glad she did at that time because I knew the woman in the shower was going to come out. All I could reply to my mother were the words ""there's a witch in the shower..."" My mother exasperatedly said finish your bath and get out. I continued to beg and plead with her to look in the shower telling her that someone was there.

Now with the door to the bathroom being open, my view of the shower was completely gone. My mother finally gave in to me and checked the shower. She was oddly surprised to find traces of ashes on the shower floor. Thinking it was strange, she remained in the room until I was through with my bath. We both know it couldn't have been my sister pulling a prank because she would have been spotted exiting the room by both me and my mother.

After that night, bath time was like being sent to my room without supper. It never appeared again though I do have a fear of closed shower curtains. Whenever I enter a bathroom, if the shower curtain is closed I immediately open it just to be cautious.

My Father's Uncle,"Washington, United States",Family / Friends Visits,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Family / Friends Visits :: My Father's Uncle

O ur entire family has been plagued by a ghost of some sort for awhile, because it seem almost impossible to fall down the stairs, even if you start to, you're always able to stop. However, if you go up the stairs at least 45% of the time you trip! Sometimes I go up the stairs and I KNOW I've cleared the stair and after that thought, I trip up the stairs! That was before my father's uncle committed suicide in our garage. It still happens but now other things happen.

There are times when you'll feel watched when you're playing on the computer. You will feel it then it will go away. Even if you turn around nothing is there. Also behind the computer on the wall, if the light is on you sometimes see a shadow go across. Personally I have seen a ""shadow man"" in our giant upstairs window, he was really dark against a white wall, I saw him in the window. He stood there then turned the corner and left. I jumped up and turned the corner as well, the man didn't run and I did, if he was there I would have seen him, I didn't see him.

Once my cat was sitting on a chair when the screen door flew open, he went out, I closed the door and went to tell my father. When I got back the cat was inside and the door was open again. My father's uncle loved cats, I could see him letting them in and out. Once, my mother told the ghosts to leave, for awhile nothing happened, then one day the screen door flew open and my dad said ""Come in"" we've noticed them again.

Being Held on My Bed,"Kentucky, United States",Old Hags / Night Attacks / Sleep Paralysis,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Old Hags / Night Attacks / Sleep Paralysis :: Being Held on My Bed

L ast night was NOT the first but the third ""attack"" so far. Let me explain and if ANYONE can give me a good explanation I would love to hear it. I went to bed and as this has happened two other times, I'm going to stress that I was not yet asleep. I just turned off the TV rolled, over to my stomach and within seconds I was being literally held down. I can't get up, I can't scream for help but I can ""moan"" loudly like someone is holding my mouth shut.

My husband said he heard me moaning several times and got up to see what was wrong but I seemed to be just ""fitfully"" moving around in my sleep. I WAS NOT asleep. I have never been held by ANYONE like this in my life and as I know I wasn't asleep, what could it be? Then when it finally lets me go, I'm sweating profusely, shaking and crying.

I am rather open to any suggestions but I will tell you this isn't a one time thing. Also in this same house we have seen a little girl playing in my daughter's room on an infra red monitor we use, when I ran up to check my daughter, my husband said she just disappeared, we actually thought it was my daughter at first. What held me down couldn't be that little girl? Could it? I wouldn't say I have ever dwelled on ""ghosts and spirits"" but I am starting to wonder just what is in this house? Could it in fact harm me or anyone else and how do I know if it becomes to dangerous?

I know if it happened to me and it was to happen to one of my children, I worry if they could actually handle what's happened. I guess I'm most worried because it actually took my breath at like a minute at a time. I've lived in this house for 29 years, little things happened before now but now it has gotten worse, any help?

Rocking Chair,"Michigan, United States",Poltergeists / Physical Manifestations,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Poltergeists / Physical Manifestations :: Rocking Chair

I was maybe 7-10 years old, when around christmas I had spent the night at my aunt Lori's house to be with my cousins. I was sleeping on one couch and my cousin Emily on another. My aunt lori's rocking chair was at the head of the couch I was sleeping on (my cousin was across the living room).

I had fallen asleep and awoke to the sound of the chair clunking (it made very loud noises when it was rocked in). I turned my head around to see who was rocking in the chair, no one was there. I got off the couch and touched the part where your butt would be, it was cold and I was so scared. I then said to who ever was rocking in the chair ""please stop you are scaring me..."" it wouldn't stop. I went to go wake up my aunt lori, she had came out of the room and the chair stopped, she said ""nothings wrong Rachel, go back to bed..."" As soon as her door had closed, the chair began to rock again, at this point I was scared, I thought that if it was a nice ghost or my Grandma Helen, they would have stopped.

I woke my cousin Emily up to go in the next room, she didn't even seem to notice the chair was even rocking. When we get into her room and close the door, the chair began to rock harder and harder... almost violent rocking.

I don't know how I went to sleep that night. I think that's the most scared I've ever been my entire life. I'm now 16 and it bothers me to this day, I've always wanted to find out who was rocking in that chair that night.

The Mad Old Woman,"Arizona, United States",Apparitions / Voices / Touches,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Apparitions / Voices / Touches :: The Mad Old Woman

W hen I was young I lived in Alaska. My family and I moved into this old house on the side of a hill about a mile out of town. I have two sisters and four brothers, so you can get an idea of the size of the old house. When we moved in, all of the house was empty except for this one room that was up stairs on the third floor. It was the only room up there. It was full of boxes, nothing seemed to be wrong in the house for over a month.

One day me and three of my brothers decided to go into that room and dig though those boxes. You know how young boys can't stay out of things. That boxes only had personal things in them, old pictures and stuff of that sort. When we left that room, it was a mess with all the stuff and boxes everywhere. I never thought anything about the room or anything in it again until about a week later.

My family had gone into town but I had decided to stay home alone. I was setting in a setting room at the foot of the stairs that lead up to that room. I was playing some John Denver tapes when I heard a voice. It was the voice of an old woman. She sounded like she was in that room and she was real mad. I could tell that she was coming down the steps by the sound of her voice, she was saying "" God #%*^& those kids, I'll teach them not to get in my stuff"" And then she went quit.

I was so afraid but I looked up real quick to see a cloud looking figure standing at the foot of the steps. I didn't know what to do so I acted like I didn't see her and just turned off the tape player, got up and walked out of the house, but when I got out there I ran the mile to town. I never said anything to anyone about what happened, but soon after, my dad moved us out of that house.

About 20 years later I took my kids to Alaska to see where I lived when I was young. I had gone to the grave yard down the street from that old house. I found a grave for the husband of the old woman, I noticed that it was fenced off for two graves but one was empty. I did some research into what happened to the old woman's body and found that before she died, she had befriended some of the towns people to take care of her. She got sick so her friends sent her to a town far away where they had better doctors.

When she died, her friends left her body there for the state to take care of while they split with each other all of her land and that old house. The old woman never got to be in the grave next to the man she had loved her hole life. And her unresting soul just walk the hall and rooms in that old house waiting for someone to put her body where she wanted to be.

My Dad Became Ill,India,Misc,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Misc :: My Dad Became Ill

I have shared my experience My Parents House with you all previously, and now I want to share my dad's experience in that place (as you all know that house was built by my great grandfather at Mumbai in 1936.) Please note that my dad is a staunch non believer in ghosts, spirits or anything called supernatural.

On 15th May 2002, we all were sleeping in our respective rooms i.e my parents in their bedroom and me and my brother shared the same room until that time. Our beloved dog 'Sholie' would sleep anywhere he wanted. On that particular day, he was sleeping in the living room. Suddenly our whole household woke up hearing our dog barking for no reason. We all rushed out thinking it to be some kind of robbery, but it was not so. He was barking looking at one corner of the house and even had convulsions. We all rushed to his help and knew he needed a doctor whereas my dad thought it was just because of a calendar put up in that particular corner and the movements it was making because of the fan above. Eventually he removed it.

On the next morning my dad couldn't get up from his bed and was running high temperature. Finally he was admitted to the hospital, and from there onwards he could stand on his feet only after one year. He became so ill that my mom was even told that he might live for a few hours. Doctors could not diagnose what exactly had happened. But whatever that was, wasn't funny at all. Maybe negative energy or something, what do you think?

Great Grandma's Haunted House,"New York, United States",Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: Great Grandma's Haunted House

T his happened to my great grandma before I was even born and my mom and aunt were just kids. One night my great grandpa decided to go out for a few hours leaving the house to my great grandma (it was night). She was reading the newspaper and a few minutes later she heard someone opening the front door and walk down the hallway to their bedroom and slamming the door behind it. She didn't care to say anything because she thought it was my great grandpa coming home. But later that night when she went to go to bed, she opened her bedroom door and there was an imprint like somebody was lying on the bed, and my great grandpa was nowhere to be seen. She was shocked so she ran and drove to her sister's house.

When my mom and her sister would stay there for a few nights, they would sleep in the guest rooms (separate rooms). My mom and her sister would both see these shadows shaped as people walking along the walls. And they would always end up sleeping in the living room side by side. My mom stopped going there after a few times of that, my aunt kept going for some reason.

My great grandma and grandpa finally got rid of the house a few years later. I can't believe they kept it for so long.

Amy,"Missouri, United States",Children Who See Spirits,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Children Who See Spirits :: Amy

W hen my oldest daughter was 2 1/2 (she is now 13), she would sense and see things that we could not. We would sneak and sit outside her bedroom and listen to her giggle and talk in baby talk in her room to all the while she was looking up in the corner of the ceiling. I would always tell her to say ""Hi"" to them for us. Her angels.

One evening my daughter and I were visiting a friend's house (well his brother's house) he was giving us a tour of his home and we had walked into his home office to look around, when I noticed my daughter stopped right at the threshold. I tried to persuade her to come in, no luck, and then we went about the house again walking in and out of rooms, up and down stairs, and we passed the home office again. She stops dead.

I picked her up and proceeded to walk through the door and she was wiggling to try and get out of arms, and saying ""no, no, no go in"". I looked at my friend's brother with a questioning look, and tried again, same response from her.

I knew she felt something, I kept it to myself and didn't want to alarm them.

We were all sitting in the living room having pizza when my daughter (2 1/2) sits next to him on the couch and says ""baby not here, baby up there"" (pointing to the ceiling) ""baby Amy went bye bye"". All of us stunned, just looking at her, my friend's brother just begins crying and then explains to me that his now home office ""was"" to be the nursery for their daughter, I was just then told was still born at 9 months and they had named her Amy.

He just hugged my daughter, and continued crying, knowing now she was okay and at peace.

Ghost of my Dead Father,Ireland,Family / Friends Visits,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Family / Friends Visits :: Ghost of my Dead Father

M y Father was a healthy 50 year old man, I was very close to him. He suddenly took a massive heart attack on the 18th of january 2004, he died in the bathroom of my family home and around 9 o'clock that morning. I was very close to my father and I have great respect for the man.

The day of his funeral came and went and I was numb to the bone, it just didn't sink in to my brain that he was gone from me, I was still in shock. That night I had agreed to stay over in my mum's house to keep her company after the funeral, I decided to get changed and I went up to my mum's bedroom. As I was leaving to go in to the bathroom, I opened the door, and as I glanced up, I saw my father standing at the bathroom door, he was a little hazy but I knew right away it was him, I had seen him.

He was smiling at me and he had his white shirt on and black trousers, then the fear and panic set in and I slammed the door. I stood in the bedroom frozen with fright, wasn't long before I opened the door and he was gone, I have never seen him again after that day, but I have sensed him in the house, or felt his presence. Especially when I have my children in the house I feel him, it's wonderful, now I love to go visit the house, I wish he would show himself to me again

Possessed,"Colorado, United States",Demons / Possessions / Exorcisms,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Demons / Possessions / Exorcisms :: Possessed

T his took place July 18, 2007 in Colorado Springs, Colorado. It was in my bathroom. I was standing up in my bathroom looking in the medicine cabinet and then all of a sudden, I felt like I was pushed from the side. I felt like I had just been stabbed, it hurt and stung really bad. I ""woke-up"" on the floor and had things all around me that I didn't move. I looked at my side later and there was finger-prints from where I felt like I had been pushed. There is also what looks like a cut on my side, right below the fingerprints. I don't know what could have caused it.

Also, I have been told that I can see / speak to ghosts. And I believe it. One time, my friend had come over (we haven't been friends since this incident) and I told her that there was something next to her, I just couldn't make out what it was. I looked closer and it looked like a face looking over her shoulder. It was very scary and very real. I tried to tell her but she wouldn't listen. Then, (this is what she claims) my voice changed and I started to say words from a different language. She said that things started to move and the door locked by itself. I reached out and grabbed a knife and stabbed it in my stomach. Then, I woke up with blood stains on my shirt and the door locked. She was crying and wouldn't let me near her. She said that I looked ""possessed"" and that I should have a ""spell"" or ""blessing"" done on me. The funny thing is, I really don't remember what happened. I only know this because she told me.

Recently, the same incident happened and I seem to be ""possessed"" more often. I can talk to people that no one can see and often people come up and ask me to contact there ""departed loved ones"". They say that I, again, become ""possessed"" and sound like there relative or whoever they want to contact. I once did this for a demonist and he said that I was possessed by a demon. This fact has scared me for all my life.

Please, if you can give me any advice what to do, please let me know. I don't want to be in the news or on t.v. And I don't want any people coming to my house so I'm signing this as anonymous.

Sights of a Man in my House,"Florida, United States",Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: Sights of a Man in my House

I have lived in my parents' house my entire life. Ever since I was young, I would get an uneasy feeling about the house. It seemed like everyday someone was missing something or the lights would turn on by themselves. I eventually got used to it and learned to accept the weird things about my home.

Recently, about 2 years ago, things got stranger. I would wake up in a hot sweat and feel as though someone was pushing down on me. Then, about the same time, my parents just started arguing everyday as though they hated each other. They had never been like this before the events started happening and I thought it might be whatever I had experience. I had begun going to church a while back and since the night I woke up with the pressure on my chest, I had begun to see things out of the corner of my eye. It was look like a man standing or walking, but when I turned, my eyes only saw air.

Then, about 4 months ago, the sighting began happening more and more. The nighttime events continued too. Now, they just happen almost 2 times a week. I thought maybe it was me until a few weeks ago. A friend of mine brought me home from church one evening and as I was about to get out, he told me ""Wait!"" I turned and saw a very odd look in his eye. He had been an EMT and is now a firefighter, so I trust his word. He said ""Did you see that?"" Having been looking for the lock on his door, I said ""No, why, what did you see?"" Now he begins to act strange and says ""It looked like a man was standing next to your door!"" I jokingly said ""Oh, so you see him too? I see him all the time."" Then he put his hand across my chest and said ""he didn't look so friendly."" I just tried to get out of the car and inside the house so I said goodbye and thanks for the ride and got out.

As I was approaching the door, I was fishing in my pocket for my keys when he screamed out ""HEY!"" and flashed is high beams. Just then, I saw the shadow of a man running away from me towards the next house. I jumped but noticed that the shadow was solid and there was no man to cast the shadow. He told me to stay safe and I ran inside. This has been getting worse since and was hoping someone could give me advice.

Slave Girl at the Foot of my Bed,"Virginia, United States",Apparitions / Voices / Touches,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Apparitions / Voices / Touches :: Slave Girl at the Foot of my Bed

V ery early on Tuesday morning, July 16, I awoke suddenly for no good reason. There was no noise, no movement, nothing at all that had disturbed my slumber. I don't know what compelled me to do so, but I immediately sat bolt upright and found myself blinking, incredulously, at the shadowy image of a young, African-American woman at the foot of my bed. In the darkness, it was hard to distinguish her features, but I sensed she was smiling at me. She appeared to have a scarf tied around her head and her clothing looked like a loose-fitting blouse and skirt that might have been worn by slave girls during the Civil War.

Disbelieving what my eyes were taking in, I shifted my gaze to the LED clock just beyond the apparition, on my dressing table. It was exactly 3:33 a.m. ""I am awake, I know I am not dreaming,"" I said aloud. And as I spoke, the apparition began to fade very quickly. Within two seconds, all that remained was a white, misty outline of the woman -- and then that faded, too. I looked down at my two dogs sleeping soundly at my feet. Neither one had stirred, making me wonder if I had, in fact, dreamed the entire experience. Wouldn't the dogs have sensed her presence, too?

This is my third such encounter. The first took place more than a decade ago when we lived in St. Louis. I awoke in much the same manner to find a man wearing a trench coat and fedora hat watching me from the foot of the bed. I was very frightened, as I thought he was an intruder until he faded into mist.

The second experience occurred a few years later in our Cheyenne, Wyoming, home. Lying on my side, I awoke suddenly and found myself face-to-face with a blonde-haired little girl wearing a pink dress. She appeared to be about five years old and was hovering next to my nightstand. Rather than fade away, she exited the bedroom by floating through the wall. I later learned that our house had been inhabited by a doctor and his family in the 1940s. His young daughter had died while they lived there.

I'm hoping to make some sense of this most recent encounter. I plan to spend some time at my public library to see if slaves did, indeed, occupy the land upon which my current home is built. In any case, the slave girl apparition seemed happy and harmless.

The Invisible Thing,"Kentucky, United States",Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: The Invisible Thing

I always wanted to believe in the paranormal, but I was a skeptic like most people. I had to ""see it to believe it"". I was only about 15-16 years old, and was dating someone who claimed his house was haunted. First of all, this guy was one of those people who stretched the truth, and made up stories all the time. So I really didn't pay any attention to his allegations. I tried to come up with excuses for everything he claimed, thinking that he and his friends were messing with me, (because things only happened when his parents were gone). Several little things did happen here and there, but I still didn't believe until one night.

His bedroom was near the kitchen where the furnace was located, but yet his room was freezing at all times. No matter how hot the rest of the house was, you could feel a total temperature change as soon as you walked through the door way. I simply blew it off stating that it was an old house. One night while watching tv, he set down his drink and came over to give me a hug, (he was facing his drink on the table, I was not). He then says ""don't move!"" We sat there a moment, when he finally let go of me, he told me to look at his drink. It had been moved over to a different spot. I tried to come up with a reason. I swore that he moved it while I wasn't looking, trying to make sense of it.

Then, there was the slamming of the other bedroom doors. He would say ""see, I told you!"" But I would immediately run through the house checking the windows claiming it was the wind coming through - BUT ALL THE WINDOWS WERE CLOSED! I didn't know what to say. What finally made me a believer was the night I heard ""IT"" walk by me! We were home alone again, I was sitting in a recliner near the bedroom door facing the kitchen. We then heard someone open the front door and walk in. There was a pause and we both looked at each other wondering who it was and what they were doing because no one said anything. Before we could ask ""who's there?"" or even check, the ""invisible"" began to walk slowly across the kitchen floor - RIGHT IN FRONT OF ME! It was the most eerie thing I had ever heard. It would take a step, and drag, take a step, and drag, as if ""it"" were dragging something very heavy. Total terror and disbelief took over my body. I couldn't move, I couldn't speak, I couldn't turn away. Not like someone was holding me, but I was so terrified like I was paralyzed with fear. I just set there shaking with my mouth open and tears running down my face. I could hear something walking right in front of me, but yet there was nothing there!

Once it walked across the kitchen it just stopped, like nothing ever happened. Then I started screaming, and went into an asthma/anxiety attack. Once I recovered, I demanded to be taken home and I never returned!

The Martinez Home Haunting Investigation,"California, United States",Ghost Hunting,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Ghost Hunting :: The Martinez Home Haunting Investigation

I think before I talking about our haunting investigation, I want to talk about a few other things to get this article started. First off, before I became HPI's ghost writer, I was merely a freelance writer that wrote about anything under the sun. I wrote travel articles, political articles - especially after 9/11, lots of comic book articles and comic book reviews. In fact I had my own monthly column in Vamperotica Magazine by Brainstorm Comics and Just Comics and More - The Caribbean's Only Monthly Comic Magazine! Yes! I am also in the comic book business. I promote aspiring writers and artists who are trying to break into comic books and animation. I do reviews of comics and ever once in a while I will find a quote of mine plastered on some comic book someplace. I also interview many comic book creators and artists from Boris Vallejo to Joe Quesada, Editor-in-Chief of Marvel Comics! You can find all my comic book stuff right at my website Jazma Online! at www.jazmaonline.com Comic books cover all genres, from sci fi to fantasy to horror to drama to real life relationships. Many comic books have become movies from Sin City, Road to Perdition, Men in Black, Fantastic Four, Spider-Man, Batman, Superman, Ghostworld, Hellboy and the list goes on and on. In fact, my comic book The Legendary Dark Silhouette will be made into a movie by independent film producer Howard Nash whose credits include: P.J., Tracks, Sleepless Nights, Feliciano: The Legend and Children of the Night. So, being in the comic book business is not a bad thing. When I first got into paranormal writing, I was invited by a friend to attend a ghost hunting investigation. I introduced myself to Shannon 'Ms. Macabre' McCabe and told her I wanted permission to write an article. She grabbed me by the arm and said, 'I love the press!"" I have been with HPI ever since, writing their stories. I introduced the comic book world to the ghost hunting world and we will soon have a comic book out called The HPI Chronicles: HPI Meets Dracula!

To let you know there are many comic books that deal with the paranormal and horror, if you ever walk into a comic book store, check out some of these titles: Loaded Bible 2: Blood of Christ - Image; Left on Mission #2 by Boom!; The Secret History Book Two: Castle of the Djinns - The Templar Chronicles: Heretic by Joe Nassise; Robert Kurtzman's - Beneath the Valley of the Rage #1 by Fangoria Comics; Mischief Night by Avatar; Madame Mirage by Top Cow and Garth Ennis' - Streets of Glory. Let me know what you think.

Now to other things, I was a guest 4 times on Sonoma's Wine, Spirits and Song Paranormal Radio Show, in which I discussed my involvement with the US Army's Military Intelligence and the Intelligence connection to UFOs. We also talked about ghosts. Carla Heine, the host of the show said that Sonoma is the most haunted city in Northern California. I now have to disagree with her, I think every city in the world is haunted, you just need to look for haunted locations. You will find out they are easy to find. Sacramento has a lot of notorious history. When I lived on W Street in Sacramento in the 70s, so was Patty Hearst and some of the SLA. Lynette 'Squeaky' Fromme was trying to kill former President Gerald Ford in Sacramento. This type of criminal activity does not leave ghost traces, because no one died. But, other notorious criminal activity in Sacramento may leave ghost traces, such as the infamous cases of Charlene & Gerald Gallegos, The I-5 Killer, Dorothea Puente and Richard Trenton Chase aka The Vampire of Sacramento. These horrifying episodes in Sacramento history may leave residual haunting activity, where a murderous act may play out over and over again. The victims to these crimes may not be at rest, because their lives were taken early in life and they may have some unfinished business to attend to. These are areas of interest for HPI. These are areas we will investigate and other areas of Northern California. We will never run out of cases.

It seems that everyone I talk to has a paranormal story, either they have seen a ghost, saw a UFO, came across a shadow person, etc. Even as I was talking with my own dad, he claims that when my mom passed away, it was only a few days later, he saw her glide down the hallway into the bedroom of his Greenhaven home. He was making repairs in the bathroom and a cold chill came over him. He never experienced anything else paranormal again, but he will never forget that image.

I used to live in Monterey and one of the urban legend ghost stories that I will never forget is that during the 60s, a soldier out of Ft. Ord, California was hitchhiking off base to see his family during Thanksgiving. Two ladies in a convertible picked him up. The girls in the car were drinking, playing their music up loud, some people say they were listening to In-a-Gadda-Da-Vida by Iron Butterfly when the car pulled up to pick up the soldier. The girls were having fun with the soldier in the car while driving and took him to Carmel Valley. They pulled the car over and began seducing the soldier and persuaded the soldier to allow them to tie him to a tree. When the soldier obliged, he found himself partially nude, tied to a tree. One of the girls pulled out some LSD, the three of them all took the hallucinogenic drug. At some point of time one of the girls pulls out a very thin glass tube and inserts the tube into the soldier's private area. When the tube was fully inserted, she breaks it off in the middle. The girls drive off and leave the soldier bleeding to death tied up to the tree. It is said that people driving down a lonely stretch of road in Carmel Valley see the ghostly image of the soldier bleeding from his groin area. So, you see stories about ghosts are everywhere and if a tragic event like this did occur, there was enough negative energy blasted into the atmosphere to leave a good residual haunting for that area in Carmel Valley.

Sometimes I have a tendency to ramble on, so let's get to the investigation this evening. The date is July 17, 2007, Tuesday. First off, we had a meeting at the Sierra 2 Center in Room 11. Alicia Perry demonstrated to the HPI Paranormal Investigators on how to eliminate background noise using a program called Audacity, when searching for EVP (Electronic Voice Phenomenon). I introduced a guest that I worked with on a few paranormal investigations, her name is Janet Michalk. She is a certified hypnotherapist and intuitive. For more information on Janet's work, she can be reached at: intouchhypnotherapy@yahoo.com and intouchhypnotherapy.com. She is a paranormal investigator with In Touch Paranormal Investigations. After our meeting we investigated the infamous Martinez Home on 22nd and H Street.

The paranormal investigators that attended this investigation after the meeting were: Shannon McCabe, Tim Hawkins, John Wachter aka Vlawde, Michelle Paykel, Michele Stump, Chris Grissom, Jennifer 'The Jen Girl"" Baca, Lisa Holt and her nephew Jessie Ibarra, Mary Casiano, Alicia Perry, Brian Colbert, Paul Dale Roberts, Lou Paman & Dee Pizarro. Lou Paman and Dee Pizarro were also my guests and this was their very first paranormal investigation. Lou & Dee are part of a band called Taal and I saw them both play last Friday at the Stockmarket Grill off Folsom Blvd. Both are great musicians and with the enthusiasm I saw in both of them tonight, I believe they will make very good investigators.

Let me describe this house. The house looks like the Munsters or Addam's Family's home. I kid you not. There are gargoyles in front of the home. The house is an actual mansion, that is over 100 years old. The house is abandoned. The house is located at 2131 H Street, corner of 22nd. There are huge palm trees in front of the house. Lisa Holt's nephew, Jessie, an intuitive or what you may call a sensitive, sensed a entity crossing one of the upstair rooms in front of the window, and he and Alicia suggested to John that he take a picture. And he got an amazing bright white orb that shows motion. The house is absolutely spooky to behold.

Alicia Perry and Mary Casiano did a scouting investigation of the home on their own, and when they got back in their truck they smelled a man's cologne. Figuring they were being followed by an entity, Alicia proceeded to tell their ""guest"" to leave. Fortunately they were doing an audio recording at the time, because they picked up an EVP that says, ""I'll git."" At least the ghost was a gentleman!

As digital cameras flashed away, gorgeous orbs were taken around the house. (already mentioned above) Vlawde takes a picture that almost looks like an orb coming out of the window. Jennifer Baca takes a picture of the window and it appears that an apparation is peering out of the window.

The neighbors of this abandoned home came over to see what we were doing and here are some of the stories they told:

That Dr. Aden Hart and his family lived in this home. There has been some deaths in the house. That at one time, one of the tenants of this home, would take his wife to the cellar and torture her, she eventually died in the house. One story goes that a man went berserk and killed his whole family in the house. None of these stories can be substantiated. The stories are all urban myth. The Martinez family lived there and they were the last occupants of the house, before it became abandoned. Now below are some possible facts:

""The occupants in 1907 were Dr. Arden C. Hart and Alice Hart. Arden founded Sutter Hospital. They lived in that wonderful house until around 1950. I do not know if one or the other died there. The house was then sold to (last name not disclosed). One of the pair's sons inherited the house. I assume he grew up there. That is when, 1976, it was vacated. In 2000 the grandson lived there very briefly. He was scared away.""

""One day, I was lounging about on our front porch. I saw the owner's son run out of the house, and then back in. That afternoon he had packed up and moved out.

In a later conversation, the lad told me this. ""I was upstairs. I had the radio going on in the kitchen. I was alarmed, when the radio began changing stations. I went down to see who was doing it. There was no-one. I went back upstairs. The radio once again began changing channels. I ran down this time, no-one again. I ran outside and around the house. There was nobody in sight. That is when I decided to move out. It was the last straw.""

Some claim that there was never any Martinez family that resided there. The Martinez family story could be another urban myth. It is said that the Amaruso(s) bought the home in the 50s and still own it. Paranormal investigator Brian Colbert received 3 EVPs and HPI is in the process of analyzing the EVPs that he picked up this night. Some of the investigators smelled cologne or smoke that emanuated from the house. At one point of time, I smelled cologne that came and went. Alicia Perry and Mary Casiano also smelled cologne on their separate scouting mission to this home, before this initial investigation.

Paranormal Investigator Brian Colbert dug up this information:

""The trouble seems to have started three weeks after Mrs. Lillian Martinez and her family moved into the remodeled house in 1973. Sounds of crashing glassware and noises of a struggle in the kitchen started late at night, but nothing was there.

Then 15-year-old Angie began seeing a gray and white cat fade in and out of reality. Upstairs, a ""panting presence"" started following people around and later materialized as the ghost of an Oriental man wearing a white coat.

The ghost of a woman wearing a yellow flower-print dress was also seen by Lilly Monica, Tyrone, and Diana Martinez. Husband Julio reported the ghosts of two children hiding in doorways. Rumors of a family murder in the house have never been confirmed, but other tenants down through the years reported similar activity. (The house is now a private residence near 22nd and H Street in Midtown Sacramento.)

I've had several people tell me the story behind the house is that the original builders and owners of the house were a prominent & historical family of both Sacramento & California in general. The patriarch of the family, apparently suffering from an unknown mental disorder (dementia?) murdered his grandchildren, the house servants, and family pet.

Searching in the Sacramento historical archives, I have uncovered some information that lends some credence to this legend. Moving backwards through the owners, I found the original owners: the Hart Family. The original owner of the house is listed as one ""A C Hart"". Cross referencing through the Sacramento Directories, the full name is Aden (or Aben, but I believe this is a typo) C Hart, physician.

http://www.usgennet.org/usa/ca/state1/biographies/achartmd.html

http://www.usgennet.org/usa/ca/state1/biographies/achartmd.html

http://www.usgennet.org/usa/ca/state1/biographies/fbhart.html

http://www.usgennet.org/usa/ca/state1/biographies/srhart.html

Note: all entries except for AC Hart mention marriages and children, except Aden's. There is also mentions within the biographies of various members of the family expiring. At the time, as you are probably quite aware, it was quite common for large families to care for the elder members, and for them to pass on in the family home. A search of the library newspapers has not turned up anything, as of yet. As you can see from the above, there is quite a lot to still look into.""

The house has a lot of history that is clouded with truths and untruths and hopefully one day, HPI will be able to unravel the mystery of this old haunted house. Wouldn't it be nice to have a house like this, that can be HPI's headquarters?

Wake Up Surprise,"Rhode Island, United States",Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: Wake Up Surprise

T his happened about 5 years ago. I had just started to do sleepovers at my boyfriend's house. He lived in a 3 stories family house with brother on 1st, mom on 2nd and my boyfriend on 3rd. His dad was living with him at the time so we would stay at his mom's on the 2nd. She was at her boyfriend's house on weekends.

My boyfriend had gotten up and kiss me goodbye, he had a early shift at work. I rolled over on my side and was about to go to sleep when I heard someone walk into the bedroom and go to the jewelry on the dresser. I thought maybe it was my boyfriend coming in for something. I said ""Honey"" and was rolling over back to see my boyfriend when at the corner of my eye I saw a dark figure walk by me. I got really scared because I realized it was not my boyfriend. I heard the ""figure"" walk from the kitchen to the living room. I was too scared to follow it.

I quickly called my boyfriend and told him to get the house ASAP. He came home to find me under his mother's covers. He at first thought it was his dad coming into the house but he locked the doors. And there is no other way to get into the 2nd floor. His brother was not home, he was away for the weekend. This was not the last time we experienced something at the house. When I told his mom about it she said she had experienced things like that often in her house.

Eerie Things Started Happening to Me,"Ohio, United States",Misc,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Misc :: Eerie Things Started Happening to Me

H ello, I am 25 years old and just wanted to ask you people some stuff. Here are three small stories each briefly describing an incident.

1.) Spring 2002: There were loud bangs from out of nowhere in my house. My dresser banged loudly once while I was laying in my room at 2-3 A.M. It was as if someone kicked it full force. The whole night, and many nights prior, I heard feet scraping around on my carpet. It was creepy. I also heard someone dance down my hallway once. It definitely was not other occupants in the house. In 2003, I also heard a very loud bang when I was sitting in the basement late at night. I immediately flew up the steps to the room it came from to find nothing. Nobody in my house heard it when I asked the next day - they were asleep. These bangs were VERY loud as if someone dropped a desk chair from 3 feet up.

2.) Summer 2000: I saw a human shape walk up to me in my peripheral vision, but when I turned to look, nothing was there. It literally vanished after being right next to me. That same night, the fan started spinning (the wrong way) on its own.

3.) Summer 2004: I always heard of that ""feeling a presence"" myth, but I never actually felt one. I never understood it until I actually felt it one night. I was sitting in the basement on the computer. When this obtrusively invading thought interrupted my mathematically preoccupied mind (I was programming the computer), and I suddenly just ""knew"" that someone was there and that it was watching me. When I looked, nothing was there, but I could point out exactly where it was. This sudden thought wasn't a result of a wandering mind - I was busy doing something irrelevant. This thought literally, obtrusively injected itself into my consciousness - just like when someone interrupts you. This was right after my grandmother died so it might have been her.

I'm having trouble conceiving this 'ghost' thing because I always understood matter and the universe in terms of physics (science). I remember one night when I was in high school, my friends and I went walking through a grave yard drunk. I urinated on someone's tombstone just to be a smart a**. Might this have something to do with it? I was stupid at the time and am sincerely sorry for doing that disrespectful act to someone's tomb.

The Way It Follows Me,"Massachusetts, United States",Misc,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Misc :: The Way It Follows Me

I encountered this when I was about, oh I don't know, 9 maybe? I had an invisible friend. His name was Anthony. We used to play and talk and do everything together. Until I found out the truth. Anthony started doing weird things like cussing at me and then going into the bathroom and crying. My Mom just blew it off because she thought I was just playing. Until one day when Anthony just cracked. We were playing hide and go seek. When Anthony couldn't find me he chose to give up. He was a real sore loser that day and all of a sudden, a figure appeared. Anthony said, ""No Mom, please don't"" She obviously didn't see me. And she started beating him up. I told my Mom about it and she said it was going too far. So I did some research and found something out.

There really was a boy named Anthony Harmone (Pronounced Har-Mon). He died of child abuse 50 years before that day exactly. So I found Anthony in the closet crying his poor little eyes out. I said, ""Anthony what's wrong"" and then he started talking about how his Mom kept hitting and hitting. And he confessed that she killed him fifty years ago in that same house. He said he could not find the light and I helped him.

A few days later he said, ""I see a light _________, what's happening?"". Then he started walking toward that light. I haven't seen him, or his mother since. Sometimes I hear a child's laugh or a ""Thank you"" But I'm glad of what I did.

Phasmophobia,"Ohio, United States",Old Hags / Night Attacks / Sleep Paralysis,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Old Hags / Night Attacks / Sleep Paralysis :: Phasmophobia

P hasmophobia (fear of ghosts) , yes I have it. Who could really blame me? I went from a non-believer to a man whose hair stands on end from the mere thought of it. It all started around midnight four nights ago. I lay in my bed, so close to falling asleep when I began hearing voices to my left. The voices sounded so close that I had to sit up. The voices continued, but I could not see a soul.

I shook my head to make sure I was not dreaming. The voices stopped for a moment, which was when I saw a flash of gray light out of the corner of my left eye. I quickly turned my head, but saw nothing out of the ordinary except that the clothes hanging over my computer chair were swaying.

Again, I saw something from the corner of my eye and jerked my head in the opposite direction to catch a glimpse. This time, the flash of light stopped. I stared at what I saw. It was six feet tall and thin as a rail. Its body shimmered in a strange gray light. Its face was no more than moving shadows. Instant fear had crept in and I had become a child again. I pulled the covers above my head, curled into a ball, and shook miserably.

The voices started again, but stopped abruptly. Next to my feet, I felt the covers start to tighten and pull away. Something was sitting down next to my feet! Without thinking, I kicked madly at the area the being had to be sitting, but only struck air. I stopped and panicked when I realized the pressure had moved to the sheets on either side of my head. Out of instinct, my hands went to the top of the covers to hold them in place. I felt a powerful force resisting me, trying to remove the covers from my head.

Unfortunately, I came up with a bad plan. I would take it by surprise. I'd let it pull the sheets down and I'd hop out of bed and out of the room. I loosened my grip and, as expected, the sheets came down to around my waist. I couldn't move though. Within less than an inch from my own face was the face of the creature, staring eye to eye. I did the only thing I could, I screamed like a girl. The face vanished instantly.

I was frozen except for my eyes. I felt a little shaking at the edge of my bed so I looked down. I saw a pair of hands hanging onto the footboard. Slowly I began to see the top of its head between the hands. When the full face came into view it lunged into the air, hovering above me. It got closer to my face and screamed the exact way I did and disappeared. The whole room shook for seconds after its disappearance.

W hen my mom was a baby and my uncle and aunty were still young, they lived in a house with my nana and granddad. They moved in one year not knowing it was haunted. The story behind it was a woman tried to kill her two children, but she didn't succeed the first time, so they gave her kids back and she succeeded the second time by smothering them with a pillow. She was locked up that was about 40 years ago.

One night, something started to happen, the house started to groan and all you could hear was crying. It woke the house up. The very next day, strange things started to happen, like the dog wouldn't go in this one room where my mum slept. My aunty and uncle started playing with imaginary friends, the ghosts were naughty, they tried and push my mom's pushchair down the stairs and slapping my uncle. My nana said my mom used to look at the window and point to the wall. When my uncle was later asked, he said we were playing with the children who used to live there and what my mom had been seeing is the children going through the walls.

People stopped coming to the house and eventually my nana went every day to the council and got a new place. The house go pulled down, no one wanted to live in a haunted house.

Can People Be Haunted?,"North Carolina, United States",Psychic / Medium,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Psychic / Medium :: Can People Be Haunted?

I 'm not exactly sure if what is going on is a ghost story, I've had these weird things happening lately, and I think it may be spirit trying to reach out to me. I guess I should start back at the beginning. When I was a kid, I used to have these feelings, feelings something bad was going to happen, etc. Then I had these dreams of things that were going to happen before they did. Nothing major, just conversations, little things. Also, I had really bad nightmares, my parents had to get me pills to help me sleep.

Not that relates to a ghost, or anything, its just to say that it lead me to be open to the idea of them existing. The ghost, or spirit whatever I'm referring to is something I've seen. Maybe seen is an exaggeration, because it's only been quick glances, out of the corner of my eye. A sort of blur. I woke up once, to see this whitish blur, sort of hovering near my bed. It probably wasn't so much a blur, but I wear glasses, so that's all I got out of it. I thought it was the after affect of a dream, no big deal. But then, I saw the same blur a few days later, in my bathroom, while I was taking a bubble bath.

It was out of the corner of my eye again, and then it was gone when I turned to look. I remember trying to talk to it, to see if it would come back. I even called it a pervert, for showing up when I was naked. Not that I'm sure ghosts can be perverts, I was just trying to get his attention.

Normally, seeing these sort of things wouldn't bother me. I've had it happen a few times before. Once when I was a kid, I saw an old guy mowing my neighbors yard, who didn't live there. I described him to my mom, and she told me there used to be a man who lived down the street like that, but he had died a few years ago. I didn't make a big deal of that, nearly everyone had family who lived nearby, it could have been his brother who looked like him or something.

Another time, I saw a lady brushing the steps of a house, in the back seat of the car, with my parents and brother. I told them about it, because there was never even a house there, let alone a woman, and the woman was dressed funny, in a white dress. They told me they hadn't seen anything. I still argue every time we pass that spot that I saw something there. They think it's funny.

Whether or not I was seeing spirits or not, I don't know. But they never seemed to see me back, so it wasn't like it was anything I was worried about. It wasn't hurting me, and it sure wasn't bothering them.

But things have started to get weirder. One day, when I was in the car with brother. I saw a man on the side of the road, who when I blinked wasn't there. My brother was with me, and saw nothing. Later, in that same spot, I saw a man who looked like he was walking out onto the road. I slammed by breaks, but the guy had disappeared.

I probably would think I was going crazy, had weird things not happened around here before. My mom told me back when her and my dad were just married, that she woke up and saw a man standing in the room. But, then he was gone. That, and she has had the feelings too, and usually they are right, she had one the night I wrecked my car.

My dad thinks the house he grew up in was haunted, he's told me stories about it.

My brother has heard the same little girl singing that I have heard coming from the woods behind our house. He used to have feelings and dreams too. Like mine, never a big deal. The only one of mine that ever mattered was that I dreamed this old lady my family knew would die, and she did. But she was old and sick, and that was probably just a nightmare. Usually these feelings, the ones that something bad is going to happen, mean a family member will get hurt. My cousin broke her arm, a family member rushed to the hospital, a friend having a nervous meltdown. Nothing ever extreme.

Since my brother believed me, I thought I was sane. Then I started having weird dreams again, dreams that made it hard to sleep. I was eleven the first time I had dreams so intense, these ones I was having started when I was 15. I had them three years, on and off, the on period always came along with headaches, dizziness, and a general feeling of something being off.

The dreams had me talking to someone, a man. He knew me, remembered me. I felt as if I knew him too, but couldn't remember. One thing he told me bothered me, I asked who he was, (and what he was), and he only said, ""go back to the beginning..."" I didn't know what that meant, so I started researching ghosts, past lives, anything in the range of the spiritual or supernatural. Because these dreams were real, they felt real, the weren't only nightmares, I've woken up screaming from them.

Only lately have these weird dreams started coming back. Except now, I can't remember them like I did before. Before they hung with me, like events I actually lived, now a few minutes after waking they fade. Sometimes before I even open my eyes. I just wake up with the same sense of sadness, of fear, of something being wrong, or out of place.

It got so I couldn't sleep. I was to scared to fall asleep. I started taking things to help me sleep, only Tylenol PM, or things like that, since my parents wouldn't get me the hard core stuff.

And, when I do sleep, I wake up. Which is leading up to what happened that really freaked me out. Like I said, I've always seen things, but they never bothered me. Never noticed me. Besides the dreams, where I've carried on whole conversations with this guy, who I have no idea who or what he is. Did I mention we are on beach a lot of the times? Always the same one. I tried to find it online, but never could.

Anyway, back to what I'm getting to, to what all this babbling has lead up to. I woke up the other morning (on one of those rare nights I sleep) and heard something moving around in my room. I had woken up because I felt something in my room, everyone knows that feeling, like when someone walks in a room, and you don't really hear them or see them, you just sort of feel them. That feeling woke me up, and I heard someone walking. I thought it was my mom, so I just closed my eyes. She comes in sometimes in the morning to turn off my lamp (I can't sleep in the complete dark, for some reason) so that's who I thought it was. Only it wasn't. I heard something behind me, breathing, I felt something touch my shoulder. I knew it wasn't my mom, I knew it then, she would never touch me while I was asleep, never stand so close and breath that way. I couldn't only hear him, her, it, whatever breathe, I could feel it.

I didn't open my eyes. It only lasted a few seconds, the breathing, the touch not even that. I went back to sleep. Later I woke up to see my mom, turning of my lamp. I wanted to ask her was she there earlier, but I didn't. Not then.

When I woke up, my lamp was back on. No one else had been in my room all morning. I asked everyone in my family. They all told me they hadn't been in there.

I don't know what to make of it. I don't feel safe. I thought maybe I was just afraid, because it isn't something that's ever happened to me before. But, nothing else has ever made me feel afraid I want to know what's going on.

I know houses can be haunted, but I don't think mine is. I live in a trailer, and I've never heard of those being haunted. But, what I wonder is, can people? Can a person be haunted? Maybe that's what's happening to me. I don't know. I need somebody to give me an idea.

So, if anybody is reading this, tell me what to do. Tell me if I'm just crazy. I just need some advice.

Ghost Repeating His Pattern,Suriname,Poltergeists / Physical Manifestations,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Poltergeists / Physical Manifestations :: Ghost Repeating His Pattern

W e were always told by our elders not to stay out late at night, because we might stumble upon 'things' that claim the streets their territory between 12 am and 5 am. And when we entered the house during those hours, we were told to enter with our back, facing the door. This way nothing would be able to follow us inside. This is not what we youngsters liked to hear. We thought it was just a silly superstition because we liked to go to the movies and stay out until 2 or 3 am.

My nephew, who was living alone, came home one night, around 3 am. He opened the kitchen door and the thought of entering with his back never crossed his mind. He came in, walked to the sink to wash his hands. After that he went to the dining room to get something out of the refrigerator to drink and then sat down at the table to drink it. Then he went to the toilet and before he went to bed, he washed his face in the bathroom.

When he was laying in his bed, he suddenly heard dragging footsteps in the kitchen. He froze, because he thought it was a robber. He laid still and heard the footsteps go from the kitchen door to the sink, then to the refrigerator, then to the dining table. Now they were headed to the hall where the bathroom and toilet were. He didn't sleep with his bedroom door closed and the bathroom and the toilet were right across his bedroom. He slowly got up and took a knife from under his bed. He slowly walked to his bedroom door and heard the footsteps enter the toilet. He than abruptly pulled open his bedroom door, stormed to the toilet door, opened it with his knife ready to defend himself.

There was nobody in the toilet. As a matter of fact, upon investigation, there was no one in the house, except him. The kitchen door was still locked and all other doors and windows as well. He was puzzled but then it dawned on him that the footsteps had followed his exact pattern when he entered the house. From that day on he made sure at night he always came in with his back, facing the door, just like the 'old folks' said.

The Shaking Bed,"Pennsylvania, United States",Poltergeists / Physical Manifestations,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Poltergeists / Physical Manifestations :: The Shaking Bed

T o be honest, I still play with barbie dolls even though I think I'm a bit old for them. But I really don't care. I don't play with them much anymore because I have had a couple of strange doll experiences. The one I will tell you is sort of mind-boggling. Not really, it's just really odd.

I have this box where I keep all my barbies in. Ever since I stored it away under my bed, a really weird thing started to happen. Sometimes my bed starts to shake. Not too violently though. You can't see it happen, you can only feel it. The only person who knows about this is my sister. I tell her just about everything even though she's just a nine year old. I have never been brave enough to actually check under my bed while it is shaking. I am not that courageous, so I don't like to check out stuff. My bed was shaking like crazy last night, it was kind of scary. I am soon going to take out the box and see if my bed still shakes. I don't actually believe that dolls are real, but it still remains a mystery to me.

I will be doing some upcoming experiments and try to search for a logical explanation. Maybe there isn't. Who knows? I also have another doll story to share with you... I'll post it up soon.

"Tucked in by a Dead, Blind Grandma","New York, United States",Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: Tucked in by a Dead, Blind Grandma

I have had paranormal experiences since I was a very small child. When I was 17, my family moved from TX to NY. As it was still school time, my parents decided that I would stay with my elder sister to complete my school year before I moved with them into our new house. At nearly 30 years later, I can't say what their logic was to move me from TX to a small NY village for two months, then 80 miles away to another small NY village. Whatever it was, I was to stay with my sister, her husband and two children.

Her eldest, a girl of 9 or so, was on a school break and at some sort of camp. So, for the time being, I was to stay in her bedroom until they made room for me. The house was sunny, single floor, almost a ranch style. It was odd in that many of the rooms had a small walled off corner, with the walls maybe 3-1/2 feet high, no doorway, but a toilet & sink in this area. There was a regular bathroom with toilet, sink, tub, etc. And maybe 3 or so of these sort-of toilets. Weird, I thought, but never really mentioned it.

The house seemed your standard 1960's maybe basic house, nothing spooky at all. Without much information on the house, I went to bed that night. The windows were at least 6 feet off the ground and a streetlight shone in. I felt as though I wasn't alone, but put it down to nerves, exhaustion, a long day, whatever. I climbed into bed, lay down on my back, and pulled the covers up. The sense - no sound, just a sense - that someone was near my bed made me open my eyes. I felt someone sit down next to my right hip, saw no one, but the blanket bunched up as though weight crunched it down. Then I felt a small adult-sized hand gently touch my upper chest, right by my throat, then a cold hand patted my right cheek once, twice, three times. The hand went away and I felt and saw the edge of the blanket tug up a little further to my chin.

I was frightened at the time and didn't sleep for a very long time. When I did, it was peaceful, dreamless and comfortable. The next morning, I asked casually if my sister knew the history of her house. ""Oh, sure!"" She laughed. ""Did Gramma tuck you in? She tucks Theresa in every night!"" It turns out that the house had been a barn. A loving son converted it to a home for his blind mother, which was why many of the rooms had the mini bathrooms. The old woman had died in the same room I had slept in.

I chose to sleep elsewhere after that. I wasn't particularly scared of her, I was just a twitchy 17-year-old-twerp who wanted nothing and no one nearby. Typical adolescent behaviour. I look back and laugh now, as there was nothing but love and comfort in that visit.

Electrical Ghost,Australia,Poltergeists / Physical Manifestations,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Poltergeists / Physical Manifestations :: Electrical Ghost

H i everyone, I've decided to share my story with you as I'm not too sure what to make of all this, I think there is some sort of ghost in my house playing with my electricity. I live in western australia, and my house it quiet old, I live near the old army barracks in swanborne which is located right on the coast. I was at home the other night, and every room that I stepped into, the light would dim in that room, flicker for a bit, then go back to normal, which is quiet strange as this has never happened before.

I brushed it off as it being an old house, until I went into my room and turned on my stereo and put it on volume level 45, I got to the kitchen, and my stereo turned off! The switch was on, but the volume had been turned down to zero. By now I was starting to get a little scared, and called my house mate and get her to hurry home. A few moments after she arrived home, I went into the toilet and the light bulb smashed through the glass light shade and onto the floor, which scared the bigeebies out of us both, but as we went into the spare room to get the spare light globes, as I opened each packet, they were all smashed, all 6 of them! How could this be, they were brand new and still in the box!

I know it could just be my imagination, but it's not just the lights either, my house phone will ring constantly and when I answer it, it has dial tone... Or I will come home from work and all the lights are on! And I'm the last to leave in the morning, and I make sure I turn them off! If any one knows anything about what's been happening. Please let me know.

"To the Stars, Smokey Cat","California, United States",Pets / Animals,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Pets / Animals :: To the Stars, Smokey Cat

T his experience actually started two days before the actual event I am going to relate to you. It actually starts the night I took the math placement test for my college in January of 2006. Upon getting my results, I naturally called my mother and father in Texas (I live with friends in California... Friends who I have come to regard as a surrogate family, so I refer to sisters when I biologically have none, and make a pointed difference between my Texas Mom and Dad (the biological ones) and my Cali Mom and Dad... Just for reference) to give them the good news.

They sounded... Upset when they answered the phone, but my Texas Mom is a bit of a hypochondriac, and I figured she'd just thought of something else that could be wrong with her, so I didn't ask why they were upset. I passed on my information, bathed in their congratulations, and got off the phone. As I was getting off the phone, I heard my Texas Dad in the background of the call say ""do you want to tell her?"", but by then my mom was hanging up.

Now, while I'd been in the testing center and all of that day beforehand, I'd felt awful. I chalked it up to nerves and taking my first standardized test (the GED aside) since 1st Grade. (I was Home schooled from 2nd Grade on.) I felt better after passing, but during the entire next day, I felt sick again. Just... Knowing what I know now, I would call it sick with grief, but then I thought I was getting the flu. Stomach cramps, nausea, headache, and depression.

Before I go any further with my story, I feel the need to explain that I had just moved from my Texas Parent's house in September of 2005, and I'd been back in December for a week to visit. During that time, 10-year-old Smokey did not stray from my side. She slept on my bed, and followed me everywhere. She'd always been a 'follow-cat', but I knew something was different this time.

I think we both knew that this visit would be the last time I would see her. I worked hard to try and be able to bring her with me, but the vet wouldn't give her clearance to fly. At under 12 pounds, and at her age, she was too old and too small to fly. And there was no way I could drive with her... In her whole life, on top of everything else, she'd never left the little apartment I'd shared with my parents. I raised her from a tiny kitten in that house.

The last night I was there during the visit, she slept on my bed, right next to my head. And as I went to sleep, I was petting her, and I remember whispering ""I'll be back to visit soon... Don't you go anywhere, baby..."" And I know she didn't want to... But what I found out almost exactly a month later...

Fast forward to me back in California, the day after my test, at sunset. Remembering my father's words and having been feeling crappy all day, I called my Texas Mom again. This time the first thing she asked was if I wanted to hear bad news then, or if I wanted to wait until after the weekend (it was a Friday night). The hair stood up on the back of my neck, and I felt my face flush... Whatever she was about to tell me, it was the reason I had been sick for two days.

The morning of the day of my test, Smokey had followed my mother into the bathroom with something hanging off of her back end. My parents were shocked and horrified to find that she had a prolapsed colon, which is basically when the last bit of your intestines turns inside out and comes out of you when you poop too hard... Smokey was too old and too small for the surgery (it would have killed her), and my parents couldn't afford it anyway... So the afternoon, while I was taking my test, they'd had her put to sleep after a day of sad goodbyes and cuddling. (What gets to me about this is that they left her body at the SPCA for disposal... If they'd called me that morning, I would have wired them the money to have her cremated and the ashes returned... But there's nothing I can do about my parents trying to shield me from the sad truth of my baby's death.)

I got off the phone in a daze. I was sitting on the couch on our back porch in California. I think I was crying... I know I didn't really break down until after I got off the phone... And my California Mom came out to the back porch to throw something in the recycling bin, and found me crying. I don't remember how I told her or my sister what had happened, but I know I did.

I've completely lost the next hour... I don't remember anything. I think I was in shock. I know my California Mom decided to make fudge to try and help me feel better, and my sister was sitting with me and holding me. When I finally managed to stop crying, my sister invited me to go out front with her for some fresh air, and I nodded.

We went out on the front porch, and I was miserable (obviously). I couldn't concentrate enough to talk, so I just was looking up at the stars while my sister rubbed my back and I tried to keep from crying again. I was so upset... What if Smokey thought I'd abandoned her? What if she was mad at me for leaving? For not taking her with me? All I could think of were things I'd done ""wrong"". Then, suddenly, I saw it.

It was the only shooting star that I have ever seen, and it seemed to fizzle out directly over our house. And as it shot toward me, I suddenly found myself flooded by memories of Smokey so clear it was as if I was watching a movie on a screen in my mind and I couldn't even see the front yard anymore... Just the memories. I saw her as a kitten, small enough to fit in my hand the day she crawled up onto our porch following an outside cat we'd been feeding. I saw the time she'd ripped all the garland off of our christmas tree and strung it around the house... I saw so many scenes that they all blurred together... And ended with that last night and her sleeping inches from my nose.

To my sister, I'd stood frozen for only a few seconds, but I swear I'd relived the ten years of my baby's life in those few seconds... And somehow I knew that the star had been Smokey coming home to me. She said goodbye, and somehow I knew that she wasn't mad at me for anything.

To make more of a point, many times since that night I have seen Smokey among our resident ghost cats... The star really was her, and she's home where she belongs... With me. Forever.

The Last Run,"Arizona, United States",Apparitions / Voices / Touches,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Apparitions / Voices / Touches :: The Last Run

H i, again everybody, this is an experience that happened to me in 1993, at my dad's home. I was eight months pregnant at the time with my oldest son Christopher. We were all about to eat dinner, my brother, my dad, my son's dad, and myself. We had dinner every night together, sitting in our usual chairs. I was about to take a bite out of my taco, when something bright caught my eye, where I was sitting I could see down the hallway really good.

There running from my brother's room was a old man probably in his 60's jogging towards my room, he was wearing short blue jogging shorts, you know the ones that have white striping all around, no shirt, white sweat bands on his head, and around his wrists. I could see right through him. I jumped up and started screaming, did you see that? Of course, everyone thought I was losing it, trying to explain what I saw through my sobbing and crying. It happened so fast, but seemed like forever, that's how good I saw this man.

As I was packing my bags, my brother came in and said he believed me and that he knew who this man was and how he died. At the time my brother was playing around with a ouija board by himself or usually with a couple of friends. They would tell us stories of how people died and you can contact them by playing the game. My brother told me that the ghost's name was Hank, he would always go jogging every morning, at the same time, same place like clockwork, until one day he was hit from behind and thrown into a ravine, where he lay there bleeding internally.

His body was not found until 4 days after the hit-in-run. He had no family and lived alone at the time of his death. My brother finished his story, and I still could not comprehend what he just told me, if it was true or what, all I can say is I know what and who I saw, but don't know why it chose me to see it, I've haven't seen it again, but my boys and I will never again sleep over at my dad's house again, we just go to visit and leave.

I can tell you though, my dad's house is so haunted, so many different family members have heard, seen, or felt presences in the house. How they got there is beyond me, I just hope that whatever it is they want, they don't try to contact me.

Little Girl Looking at Me in the Night,Canada,Apparitions / Voices / Touches,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Apparitions / Voices / Touches :: Little Girl Looking at Me in the Night

T oday, July 19 2007, was a pretty weird and off day for me. In the morning I was walking to work and as I was waiting for the lights to change so I can walk across the street, a bird came right across me and pooped on my head. I have heard that this means good luck. The rest of my day was a good day.

That night I couldn't really sleep, it was on and off. I woke up and I was so thirsty and I decided to get up and get a glass of water. When I turned the other way, I saw a little girl at around age 7, blonde, short but curly hair, and was wearing a white dress, with white shoes, smiling, and her hands were together.

I got so scared that I was breathing harder then before. I right away blinked and she was gone. I got up really fast got water and ran back to my bed and put the sheets over me and tried to fall asleep, which I did, and didn't see her for the rest of the night. But I was having weird dreams which I don't remember.

I woke up in the morning and told everyone about this and they all started laughing at me saying that it was a dream but I thought I was awake. I know I wasn't sleeping because I was awake before I saw the little girl.

Was It my Brother?,"Arizona, United States",Family / Friends Visits,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Family / Friends Visits :: Was It my Brother?

H i All, I have shared with you in the past of an incident that my friend experienced . This one is my own experience, this was sometime ago 1994 to be exact. It all started when my brother was murdered, he was bound and tied and shot, then thrown on the side of the road. I try to think that my experience was in some way related. I at least wanted to believe that. Some time before his death, my mom and myself and my brother all planned to move in together. My mom had me at 15 and brother at 16 or so my brother and I were very close all our lives, it was always him and I. Well that year, my mom divorced her second husband and we were thinking that it would be nice if we all moved in together as adults.

That day Sep 14, 1994, we got approved for a beautiful condo, my mom and I worked at the same place at the time so we knew first since she called and I was there with her. We were so excited to go home and tell my brother. Once I got to the house, there were two detectives waiting for us at the door with their suits on and badges and they didn't look like they had good news. Once we got in the house, they asked us to please have a seat and you know when they ask you to sit, there is no good news.

That is when they told us they discovered my brother's body on the side of the road tied and bound hands and feet, of course my first question was how do you know it was him, they said finger prints from a time when he was 13 and took some kid's lunch money, they arrested him to teach him a lesson. You could imagine the loss and pain we felt, he was 19 and I was 21.

To make a long story short, my mom and I had to arrange the funeral, got past that and then next question was to decide if we shall still move in the home as we planned and we thought he would have wanted us to, so we did, my mom and me and at that time my two kids.

About a few weeks later, I was down stairs doing laundry, my usual chore on a sunday night, getting laundry ready for monday morning.

I was tired and decided to leave the laundry on the couch and I folded that last blouse (mine), long sleeved floral print, and laid it on top of pile. I went upstairs to bed. The next morning I went down stairs to pick some clothes to wear, I saw that floral blouse on top as I left it and reached in the middle of the pile and grabbed another. Might I mention this was my mom's b-day that day and she had been so sad, no need for explanation. I got dressed and my plan was to go in early to work so I can get out early to have her a special evening with flowers, balloons, the whole nine yard, just her and my kids. She had already left that morning earlier than I.

I did get out early that day and came home before her, put the flowers down on the dinning room table, went up stairs to change. I went to my room and I saw that there was a blouse laid on my bed. Now my bed, I always make it before I leave in the morning, this blouse, the one I mentioned earlier, the floral print long sleeved one, was laid out as if ready for someone to wear, laid out like a cross which was weird to me, arms of the blouse extended out like it had just been ironed. ""Okay"" I thought, I know I didn't put it here and I had seen it that morning so I know it was down stairs on the couch. At this point I figured, well maybe my mom came home early and wanted to wear it and changed her mind and I figured she would be home later. Never even thinking about it and went on to my usual business.

My mom came home on her regular time, did the whole surprise thing and she was happy that I did that for her, as we started getting plates ready to serve dinner, I asked her ""mom, when you came home today, you didn't decide to wear my blouse huh?"" She was like ""what are you talking about mija?"" she said she worked a whole day and hadn't left early. I then was so freaked only because there is no way I put that blouse there laid out like that! I told her and we were both freaked because she knows I am not nuts and I wouldn't lie. She did say though ""maybe you put it there and changed you mind"" I said ""no mom I knew what I wanted to wear that day and that blouse was not it"".

To this day that scares me but in a way I would like to think it was my brother trying to communicate some how, it creeps me out to imagine that blouse floating in mid air from downstairs to my room upstairs or how ever it made it up there but believe you me, it was not done by me, my mom or my kids who at the time were at their dad's house. I know it sounds weird but hey, I can't explain it even to date, I just can't. I would think if it was my brother, he would have chosen another way to try to be noticed that was odd to me, but then I am not a ghost or spirit so I wouldn't know. I like to think it was him at least. I apologize for the length of this story but it would have not made sense unless I gave detail. I hope it even gets posts. Thanks for reading.

"In Bed, Weird Noise","California, United States",Old Hags / Night Attacks / Sleep Paralysis,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Old Hags / Night Attacks / Sleep Paralysis :: In Bed, Weird Noise

I just came home from a road trip and I was REALLY TIRED. So I went up on my bed and slept, and a few seconds later I heard this buzzer noise. And I tried to go to sleep, but I heard it again. After the third time, I heard a voice, it said ""Stop making that noise"" and right after that I heard the noise, and then I opened my eyes and I couldn't move. It wasn't like I tried to move. I was energyless. I just couldn't move. It felt very scary. I felt like there was this type of ghost holding me back, with a weird kind of energy. The way that I couldn't move freaked me out a lot. I felt as if I was possessed and I couldn't control my actions. I was just still.

I never had this experience before, I just need some help. I want to know what's happening and why. I've also had a lot of other ghostly presence in the house I moved in with my family. Every night I hear stuff fall or a soda can open. I get really scared. I hear voices ALL the time. I've read some stories and it said that a demon might be trying to attack me, I'm catholic but I don't wear a cross. I've also been told ghosts are never in a christian or catholic house. My family has a statue of Mary, and my mom told me that no ghost can come into a house with Mary inside the house.

No Figment of my Imagination,"Washington, United States",Apparitions / Voices / Touches,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Apparitions / Voices / Touches :: No Figment of my Imagination

Y ou don't have to believe this... But it's true. I used to have a dog named Tasha who would NEVER go through my kitchen without whining or shivering on the way to my parents room. From that point on I always thought there was a ghost in my house (which my parents called Casper).

After my dog had died, I must have been about eleven years old. I was lying in my bed one night, watching t.v. It was around one in the morning and I couldn't fall asleep. My mom had gone to bed hours before and at that time of my childhood I had always been scared of being alone late at night (I watched too many scary movies).

My dad was going to be home in about an hour and a half so I just laid in bed and waited trying to calm myself down with the thoughts running through my head and the chills going down my spine. My door was slightly open with the hall light shining onto my wall. I listened to my t.v and watched the wall for no apparent reason. Minutes passed by and the chills got stronger and I broke out in a cold sweat. Out in the hall a dark figure passed by. It looked like a man around six feet tall, he seemed bald and really muscular. He passed into the room next to me making no sound as he went in, but there seemed to be a scratching on the walls above me. The scratching stopped after a few seconds and then there was just silence, but the chills never went away.

I knew that every door was locked and every window was shut so there was no possible way it was an intruder. My eyes stayed peeled open until my dad unlocked the front door and turned on the t.v. Even now I'm still scared.

The Grudge Lady,Thailand,Apparitions / Voices / Touches,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Apparitions / Voices / Touches :: The Grudge Lady

T his story I am going to share is the story of my friend named ""Bee"". She and her two brothers were on their way home and it would take 3 hours to get there. Mark was seated on the driver's seat followed by his sister Bee and their older brother Chie. He was driving fast because they had to be home before their mom's birthday.

Halfway through their journey Mark saw a woman crossing the road wearing black and carrying something. He didn't say a word. But Bee asked her brothers if they saw it. All of them did. While they were talking about what they saw, Mark looked at the driver's mirror and saw the woman running after the car. They were very frightened and Mark drove the car as fast as he could. But the woman in black also ran as fast as she could until she reached the side window of the driver's and looked at them and disappeared. They were very frightened but reached home safely.

Nobody dared to sleep in their own bedrooms, instead the three slept in their parents'. The same woman appeared in Mark's dream. He said that the woman in black stood next to him and apologized. She said ""I didn't mean to scare you but please say a prayer for me. I am not at peace, please do merit for me in the temple."" She also explained how she died. She said ""My husband and I were riding a motorcycle around 1:00 AM from a party in town. My husband stopped for a pee. He parked the motorcycle along the road when suddenly a car ran over me and the motorcycle and left me. My husband couldn't take me to the hospital. I died because of too much bleeding. I will find the man who hit me"" then she disappeared and Mark woke up.

The next day Mark and his family went to the temple and did merit and prayers for that woman. Since then she never came back in his dreams.

Message from the Grave,Suriname,Family / Friends Visits,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Family / Friends Visits :: Message from the Grave

M y grandfather died 15 years before my grandmother. After he was buried, my grandmother reserved and paid for a spot right next to him. A few years later, she moved to the Netherlands, where 5 of her children were living, leaving her eldest son who was already married, and my mother behind.

A few years after that, my grandmother had a dream in which my grandfather asked her to please move the heavy stone next to him, as he did not have the strength to do it by himself. He was very irritated. My grandmother did not know what to make of it, because she had never dreamed about her husband since he died. She couldn't shake the feeling that it meant something, so she decided to call my mother and tell her about it. My mother in turn told her brother about the dream. He was startled and confessed that he had recently buried his mother-in-law in the spot that was reserved for my grandmother. He had told no one about it, because he knew they would object to it. And he figured that my grandmother was now living in the Netherlands, so he might as well use the spot for his mother-in-law.

My grandmother left it at that and when she passed she was buried here, in the same cemetery as my grandfather, but far away from his grave. It was sad that my grandfather had waited all those years for my grandmother, but in the end we were not able to lay her to rest beside him.

Big Bang,United Kingdom,Misc,"I know maybe you are thinking ""bet they are lying or must be joking"". But this is a true story. It all started on Friday 13, 1986. I will never forget what had happened to me, that ghastly moment, the troubles I had. It all happened that night, I was watching a horror movie, I knew I should not because every time, I would imagine there was something in that house. You see, I lived alone in that old, bleak house. I quickly switch my movie off because I heard this loud tapping coming from my attic door. So I built up some courage and slowly walked to the attic, not knowing what would lay beneath that rotten door.

The tapping's would become bangings, every step would bring me fear. Eventually I got to the attic door, opened it slowly, the banging stopped and nothing was there, just cobwebs and scrap books from years ago. I decided to go to bed as it was next door. So I brushed my teeth quickly, wanting to go bed of course. There I was, laying on my bed, listening to the little noises my house made. Until there was a large BANG next door, I was terrified... who wouldn't be. I started to cry, thinking some burglar got into my house. As the telephone was on the table next to me, I rang the police to come and check my house of them terrible burglars.

After waiting 15 minutes, I heard a bang on the door. So I ran downstairs and answered the door. But the police weren't at my door, they were a distance from my house, like they were scared of someone or something. I will never know what did happen but it must be bad to keep the police away...

A Ghost? Or my Imagination?,"Virginia, United States",Misc,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Misc :: A Ghost? Or my Imagination?

H ello. I am a 14 year old girl, and I believe that my house is haunted by someone or something. One day I was home alone downstairs on the computer. I was just sitting there and I heard a knocking. I knew it couldn't be either of my pets because they were sitting right in front of me in plain view, sleeping. And I also went upstairs to see if someone was at the door, no one was. It really freaked me out. Then it stopped and started again.

Previous to this, at night while I am in bed, I can hear someone or something walk back and forth in my hallway. I know it is not my pets because my dog sleeps upstairs and my cat sleeps with me, and my cat is normally sitting with me when I hear it. And also I will be home alone and be sitting on the couch upstairs reading and something walks up and down the stairs. I repeatedly look over the mantle at the stairs and I don't see anything. I have told my parents about this stuff and they just think I am joking around and they don't listen to what I say. I have studied all sorts of paranormal activities and I have come to the conclusion that my house may probably be haunted.

I also watch all the haunted shows on TV, i.e. Most Haunted and A Haunting. My mom thinks that it might be my imagination running wild. But I don't think so. What do you think and what should I do?

What Happened to Me?,"Virginia, United States",Old Hags / Night Attacks / Sleep Paralysis,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Old Hags / Night Attacks / Sleep Paralysis :: What Happened to Me?

I t was late one night and I felt like I could connect with a spirit. I just had a strange feeling, but I was ready for this to happen. I always felt that I could open up and be a medium, I just never really believed. I thought it was made up or something terrible would happen. It must have been around midnight when I went upstairs to my bedroom and laid down on the bed. I spoke out loud, I said, ""I'm here come to me, I'm ready"". I heard sounds like someone walking up my stairs then I felt paralyzed, I physically could not move, and there was a loud high pitched scream in my right ear. I could not move, then finally it was gone. I couldn't sleep that night... what happened?

Another time, when I was a little girl about 4 years old. I was living in Miami Fla. I woke up from my bed and started to walk to my parents room, like always I wanted to snuggle with them. As I was walking down the hall, I saw that there was a party. There must have been 50 people/spirits or so. They were eating at our dining room table. It was buffet style in the Florida room. The people were dressed like from a different era, maybe the 1940's.

A lady dressed all in black, with long black hair came to me. She knelt down and told me to ""SHHH, go back to bed"". That happened 33 years ago & I have never forgotten her. Who could she be? Why did she send me back to my room?

My Grandma,"Virginia, United States",Family / Friends Visits,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Family / Friends Visits :: My Grandma

T his is short, and this stuff hasn't happened to me, but my mom. She doesn't think anything of it, but my stomach flips whenever I think of it. It doesn't help that I'm home alone right now, either. Yipee. I've lived here all my life (12 years), in this (hopefully) normal house. About four or five years ago my dad's mom moved in with us, very sick. We made a bedroom out of the front room and that is where she passed away. Her ashes are still in that room.

All her life she was a prankster. After her death, it started out with little things. The first was moving the toothpaste. The slamming doors, pushing my dog into the pool. She disliked this dumb, but sweet dog. Then for about a year and a half, she stopped. But now, she's started again. I have no clue what has triggered this but I really want to talk to her. If you have any advice for this please comment.

Now scarier thing have been happening. About two months ago, one night at about 3:00 am, my mother awoke to the sound of the shower going on full blast. She checked on us kids to see if we were in the shower, but we were all sound asleep. Then she opened the door, the shower still on full blast. But when she looked in, the shower nozzle was just dripping. My mom has a brave soul.

Then last night, my mom woke up at about 2 am, the sound of fake wooooowooooowooo, the fake kind like from old horror movies, from my brother's room. My brother was just at a party that night and it didn't seem like me. Then she opened the door and no one was there.

Communication Through Speakers,"Alaska, United States",Ouija Board / Seances,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Ouija Board / Seances :: Communication Through Speakers

I realize that people here will probably think I'm nuts, but I swear on my immortal soul that this happened. I'd decided that communication was the only solution to my problem with the Shadow People, so two nights ago, I began trying to make contact. Last night, I finally got a response and even I couldn't believe it was happening even though I was sitting there, hearing it.

Last night, I went into my room with a flashlight and what I admit was false courage. It was 11:00 at night, I know for sure because I took notes in a notebook to track time and any responses I may have gotten. Unfortunately, I don't have a digital recorder or camera that may have caught some of the responses, just what I wrote in the notebook.

I sat on my bed and opened the notebook, pencil at the ready with my flashlight tucked in tight to my side. I kept the light off and the door closed to shut off any outside influences. I posed a general inquiry of, ""If there is any entity present please make yourself known..."" I waited and got nothing. I tried time and again, asking things like, ""If someone is here, could you please make a noise so I know you are there?"" ""Can you manifest so I can see you?"" ""Why are you here?"" things like that. As time went on and I came up with nothing, I began feeling like a fool. I made the move to get off my bed to turn on the light when a loud crackle came from somewhere at the end of my bed.

I quickly looked at the clock and jotted down the time. By then, it was 12:37 a.m. I sat and waited for the sound to come again. When it did, I tried to pinpoint its source and found that it was coming from the speakers of my stereo, which sits on a shelf directly at the foot of my bed. I went over with my flashlight and checked the wires to see if that could be the cause, saw nothing wrong with them and made a decision that, I believe, gives this whole experience credence. I unplugged the stereo.

I went back to my bed and did a quick scan of the room before turning the flashlight off. I put the pencil back against the paper and asked again, ""Is there anyone in this room with me?"" The speakers crackled again and I tried not to panic. I knew for a fact that I'd just unplugged all the wires of the stereo, there was no reason for it to make that sound. Just to be sure, I checked with the flashlight, confirming what I already knew. It was still unplugged. There was no power being fed into it. I asked, ""Could you maybe use the speakers to communicate with me?"" when there was another, very loud crackle, I thought I heard a voice in the static. I picked up my pencil and asked, ""What? Could you repeat that?"" Another crackle, and I took to marking them as responses in the notebook.

This went on for a while as I asked again and again who was there and why. After some time, I made a mark of the time. At that point, it was 2:12 a.m. Finally, I swore I heard a voice in one of the crackles and I leaned closer to the speakers. I asked in a clear voice, directly into the speaker, ""Why are you here?"" The crackle I got in response was quieter, kind of like when you tune a radio and the static goes down, allowing you to hear bits a pieces of a station. And I swear I heard the word ""Stay"".

Another crackle and then I heard, or thought I heard, ""Never leave...""

I don't really remember first hand what came after that, but according to the notebook, this conversation ensued:

And then I noted that there was a loud, high noise that came out of the speakers, and I made a note that it sounded vaguely like a scream, then a click came out of the speakers, like when someone hangs up a phone.

I don't know what this means or what to do now. Whatever happened, I don't remember most of it and if it weren't for the notebook, I wouldn't have any idea what happened. Could it be that I actually made contact or is it simply my subconscious putting on a show for me? I can't tell and would greatly appreciate any input you may have. Thanks.

I t was a cool night in July 2007 in West Virginia, two of my nieces and I were looking for something to do, one of the girls asked to go out and stir up a ghost. It was around 9:00 p.m. We drove around for a bit and ended up in Logan County, after reading a web site concerning the brutal murder of Mamie Thurman. It has been more than 60 years since the murder, which occurred in Logan County on June 22, 1932, legend has it that her body was dumped in the woods along 22 mines mountain road.

So lo and behold that's where we (my nieces and I) drove to, we had two digital cameras with us, while Tina drove Marsha and I clicked our cameras at random, for the most part all we could see on the small screens of our digitals were orbs, distorted pictures and the glare of the headlights.

When we returned home and uploaded all the pictures onto my computer, Marsha had turned around and snapped about 4 pictures of the back windshield of the SUV we were riding, (the back window was heavily tinted) in all but one of the pictures the only thing you could see was a black window, in one of them there were many orbs, of all different sizes, in the midst of the orbs you could see a very clear picture of a dark haired woman dressed in a black cloak.

When I uploaded the pictures from my digital camera I captured many many orbs, one of the pictures turned out very distorted all accept the lower right corner where it is very plain to see a woman dressed in a black cloak (long cape) sitting on the ground leaned up against a tree with her head bowed and her arms crossed.

Up to this point I was a skeptic, but now I do believe that when a person is murdered or passed before its time that their spirit lingers on earth.

[note from the webmaster: this story has been updated by the author on 2007-07-27 with the following email:]

""Hi, if you look to the lower right you can see a woman sitting there leaning against the tree. In the second picture l am sending was taken by my niece with a different digital camera. The window of the SUV we were riding was heavily tinted, look past the orbs to the right you can see a woman in a black cloak. The vehicle was on the move when both pictures were taken. Both pictures were taken about the same time, it was about midnight on July 21, 2007 on 22 Holden Rd. In Logan County.

Black,Australia,Apparitions / Voices / Touches,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Apparitions / Voices / Touches :: Black

M y partner and I moved into an old army barracks that was over 150 years old, which over time was turned into 4 conjoining homes. A lot of deaths had occurred there. And the only reason that the house came up for rent was because the girl who lived there before us overdosed and died... in our bedroom. My partner worked shift work 5-6 nights a week between the hours of 9pm and could work up until 6am the next morning.

When my partner would get home from work, I would always hear him coming in the door, and then he would come into the bedroom and kiss me, and some nights I had woken up to him just sitting on the side of the bed looking at me. One night, I had the feeling that someone was in the room, and I just assumed that it was Corey coming home from work, so I opened my eyes a bit, and there was this black 'thing' right in my face. I screamed and just as a reaction, I swung my arm in its direction and during this time I had squeezed my eyes shut, but it was only for a second.

When I opened my eyes again, the black 'thing' was gone, but I had woken up Corey who I then remembered had not worked that night. He then said that something had suddenly woken him up only 10 minutes earlier. I would always leave the light on in the lounge room because I didn't want to be in that house in the dark, (the light from the lounge room would light up our bedroom), I knew that it wasn't just a shadow.

Also, due to Corey working night shift, I was often in bed alone, and I frequently got the feeling that I was not the only one in the room. If I ever had the feeling that I was not alone, then I would feel that they were standing beside the bed looking at me, so I would always turn around and face the wall and get to sleep that way. I just used to put it down to that they were watching over me while Corey was at work, but it still scared me.

Ghost Cat,Australia,Pets / Animals,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Pets / Animals :: Ghost Cat

W hen I was young, I had a pet cat; His name was Olly. We had him for a few months, and I was very attached to him by then, he would sleep at the end of my bed, or even sometimes at my pillow. Then one morning, he wasn't there, I went to find him, I wasn't worried, he sometimes was gone from my room in the mornings. Mum said to come outside, and she led me to something on the side of the road. There was something bundled up on the side of the road in a blanket. I asked what it was; Dad answered Olly, he unwrapped it and showed me, the poor thing had been run over. I ran back to my room and I was crying for a while, and I spent the rest of the day in my room.

That night, I woke up to go to the bathroom, which was on the other side of the house, walking out of my room, I noticed something transparent, I went to look, and it darted behind the couch, I ran back to my room and covered myself with a blanket, to scared to go to the bathroom, I just fell asleep.

The next morning when I woke up, I went to see if there was anything behind the couch, and as I expected, there wasn't anything. Well, that day, we buried Olly in the front yard. When I went to sleep that night, I could feel something on my bed, I looked over it, and there was a small depression on the sheet; about the size of a cat.

I know that I was visited by my deceased cat, what else could it have been?

I would like to see other peoples views, I know it was real, I know it.

Unexplainable Things After Grandmother's Passing,"Georgia, United States",Family / Friends Visits,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Family / Friends Visits :: Unexplainable Things After Grandmother's Passing

I t was 2001, my family and I was visiting my sick step-grandmother. The day she came home from the hospital she was with us for about 10 minutes and passed away. The next night, me, my brother and cousin were setting in the kitchen talking, listening to the radio. There was a old fashion clock hanging on the kitchen wall that didn't work. It didn't even have any batteries in it. We looked up at it, and it started ticking and making different noises. About 5 minutes later, there was about 3 different songs on the radio and the volume on the radio was going up and down. There was nobody at the radio but we could see the knobs moving.

Later on that night me and my brother were going to bed and I had to sleep where she passed away, in the living room. While I was trying to go to sleep I could hear the words and sounds she was making as she left us. I haven't really wanted to go back to that old house again.

In 2006 my oldest brother sold the house and land and moved to Florida. I feel like she was trying to send a message to us but I haven't figured out to this day what it could be. Maybe you can help me understand this situation a little bit better.

Telephone Call,"Nevada, United States",Poltergeists / Physical Manifestations,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Poltergeists / Physical Manifestations :: Telephone Call

I 've been gone for awhile... We've been trying to put everything behind us, nothing has been happening since my last story, maybe a month or so. The other night my cousins and best friend were all over at my house, we were all in my room: Me, Darian, Layla, JJ and Josh. Amanda was in Darian's room playing on the computer. We had the lights off and were reading ghost stories like we did when we were little and see who went for the light first, so we were all a little jumpy.

But then JJ found my other stories and everyone got really freaked out. After that we went on to read more stories and suddenly we heard something fall and run. It sounded like a small animal scurrying across the floor like a mouse (but I know for a fact we don't have them) so we looked over, I had assumed someone had knocked my phone off the cradle and onto the floor, so we bent over my bed to look for it, we couldn't find it so we just went on.

Then beeping... First it came really slow and soft, then it sped up, beeping a lot and loudly as if it were on surround sound or something. The beeping stopped and then the phone rang once. We all looked over at it, everyone's breath was held. We grabbed someone's cell phone and called Amanda to make sure she was okay, she came into my room and turned on the light.

We all tried to explain ourselves but she just looked at us like we were crazy. JJ froze and told us his arm was numb and he couldn't feel it, I reached over and touched it, it was way cooler then his right arm. Maybe an hour later a large bruise formed on the cold arm, it looked like a large palm, as if someone had grabbed him hard. This all happened at around 3:40 am. If that might have anything to do with it.

Afterwards I thought about it and we were all trying to find some reason for it all, I *69 the number to figure out who may have called, it came back as my friend's number, and she would never call my house that late. Also JJ was researching how many times it beeped (I forget) but divided by another number the beeps equal out to 666. I don't know but it was just something creepy and unexpected seeing as it's been so calm here the last month or so, also we found out if you turn out my lights and take a picture of the corner of my room, you see 3 orbs. I'll get a picture up if I can. It was the first time of me seeing them so I don't know. But I'll try.

Another unrelated story, we hear whispering in darians room, I could have sworn I heard my mom talking to me through the door, but she was in her room sleeping, and snoring. And Darian always hears something say ""Drop it"" so, now we have that going on too, I guess maybe playing it off as paranoia may have just ticked them off?

Held by a Dark Figure,"Arizona, United States",Old Hags / Night Attacks / Sleep Paralysis,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Old Hags / Night Attacks / Sleep Paralysis :: Held by a Dark Figure

W hen I was 8, I lived in a house where there were many weird things that were very eerie, such as doors closing by themselves without it being windy. As the day fell and night came, I had to go to sleep. Some nights, when the closet door was open and the lights were turned off, I could see a disturbing dark figure in the closet. I could see it staring at me, but I thought it was just the clothes inside.

My room was pretty big, it was probably 12 ft. wide and 32 ft. in length, and the closet was 30 ft. away from my bed. One day I went to sleep forgetting to tell my mom to close the closet door. I awoke and looked to the right, I could see the thing right there, just 30 ft. away and I got scared but went back to sleep. I awoke again and I looked around and noticed that I was being held by a dark figure that had no apparent facial features. At first, I thought it was either my dad or my mom and so I went back to sleep.

The next morning I found myself in my bed and noticed the closet door open, I immediately closed it. Later that day I asked my parents if they had picked me up in the night and they said ""no, why"" but I didn't respond to them. Since then I have been terrified of closets being open.

Spirits Following Us,"Texas, United States",Ouija Board / Seances,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Ouija Board / Seances :: Spirits Following Us

M e and my friend Brooke from quizilla were talking on IM. She said that she had a little boy's spirit roaming the place. It would get cold, then he would show himself. So in the middle of the conversation she said he was coming. Now he was there and he turned on the water. Yes he's a funny kid, who loves to play around! So she tried to turn off the shower but he sprayed her! It's one of those old showers with the heads that come off you know? That's what he did before he allowed her to turn it off. I laughed at that! I asked how old he was and she didn't know so she asked and she kept hearing and seeing the number 6. It turns out he was 6! Close to my ghost, Lela . This is somehow connected to my other story.

They took us over to talk. Except I wasn't fully yet taken over. They talked a bit then they just left! Now that was the coolest experience ever! Hhe said he might stay the night but didn't know how. I said by the mirror since that's practically the only way I know how they can teleport besides following you. So he came over and when I went back into my room after watching tv, he threw stuff off the table! Then the next day he was gone.

Here's the recent recent one. I was watching tv when I saw an orb go through the wall! I wasn't freaked out just surprised. Then I saw a lot of shadows until I went into my room... Next we held a seance, we got a lot of contact! But it's all erased except for the names and ages. Lela, the little girl is around 6 and 7. She has a brother named Aelx and he's 10. And the mother, her name is Cassey. Cassey is the woman I saw. Here's another thing, there's a dad, a grandpa and a grandma! I'll find out their names soon. I must get that camera!

Man with Blonde Spiky Hair,"South Carolina, United States",Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: Man with Blonde Spiky Hair

T he stories that occurred in my house about last year or so do not take much effect now. Blessings have been done and such so hopefully it will keep the bad spirits out for good. My house is a very old house, I don't know when it was built and actually don't know much about the history but I feel like something terrible has happened in this house and whomever's spirit lurked around here does not want us here what so ever.

When I was 11 years old, one night, around say really early in the morning or so, I woke up and I opened my eyes and there stood a man before me smiling at me as if he's ready to attack. He had blonde spiky hair and wore a black type of robe. I yelled for my mom and then he disappeared.

2 weeks later, I was in my room watching television and my bed was set in front of my desk, I looked under the desk and there he was again sitting under there, smiling at me. I pushed my pillow down there and ran into the living room scared out of my mind.

About 2 years ago, I was in the bathroom washing my face and I suddenly heard someone breathing very heavy right behind me. I hate sitting in silence in this house.

Visit to my Stereo,Canada,Poltergeists / Physical Manifestations,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Poltergeists / Physical Manifestations :: Visit to my Stereo

T his is just something I thought would be interesting to share. When my kids were just little ones, (oldest being 3 years old and baby was 6 months, now they're 15 and 12) we had a pretty decent stereo system. I'm sure you can guess hubby picked it out (boys and their toys!) and he was pretty proud of it. We'd had it for just over a year with no problems but one night, we were woken up in the middle of the night when the stereo started blaring full volume. We ran downstairs at double speed to find nothing out of order except the stereo blasting a CD as loud as it could possibly could go. We quickly shut it off so the neighbors wouldn't complain. Our oldest son, Ben, was still upstairs in his room as he didn't take the stairs on his own and our youngest, McKenzie, was confined safely in his crib.

The stereo was on a high shelf for the kid's safety and so hubby's precious equipment wouldn't end up with sticky fingers all over it. The rule was that the stereo must always have the volume turned down to zero before turning it down so the speakers wouldn't blow when it got turned on. We couldn't figure out what had happened and put it down to some oddity. Well, I did, hubby thought I had been careless. We left it at that and went back to bed.

The next night the same thing happened. We shut it off and tried to figure things out. We thought of the power bar but the TV, VCR and game systems were plugged into the same power bar, which had a surge protector. This means if there is a power surge, everything will shut down. And if the power bar was defective somehow, it should have caused everything plugged into it to come on too. I was getting a bit spooked but hubby said the receiver must be defective somehow and made an appointment to have it serviced. The girl who took our call was reluctant because she thought we were being silly but since the warranty had just barely run out, she made an appointment for about two days later.

Meanwhile it happened every night until we took it in. They had it almost a week so things were peaceful. They called for us to pick it up and said they couldn't find anything wrong even after double checking it. He said he changed some part inside because it was the only thing he could think to do and we should have no more problems. So he claimed.

Once again we were shocked out of sleep by a blasting stereo. We were both a little freaked out and we unplugged it. The next night loud music woke us again! When we checked again it was plugged back in.

Hubby was a little bit irate when he called back this time and she was a little quicker to get it looked at. The service department still claimed they couldn't find anything wrong but for the sake of keeping a good customer happy (it was a Sony as was all the rest of our electronics) they replaced it with a brand new stereo receiver, the next model up. We were quite satisfied with that.

After we got the new receiver we never had another problem. As a matter of fact, that stereo is still going strong. My kids use it on their TV for playing their game systems. I think we just had a bored music lover passing through. I hope he found a nice concert hall to take up residence in.

Shadow of a Girl,"California, United States",Apparitions / Voices / Touches,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Apparitions / Voices / Touches :: Shadow of a Girl

M y TRUE story starts off when I arrived at a big beautiful cabin in the mountains. The place was more of a house than a cabin! It was a really calm place to rent and I knew I was going to have a great time. I remember thinking that it would be a great place to stay for the next three nights. The cabin had three rooms, two on the right side of the house, away from the kitchen and the living room, and the one that I was going to sleep in, which was all by itself next to a bathroom, kitchen, and living room. There were 2 beds in that room, my uncle my aunt would sleep in 1 and the other would be for me and my cousin Memie.

That night, I woke up in between 3 and 4 a.m. There was a dark shadow by my bed. (I was the closest to the slide door closet) It looked like a girl so I thought it was my cousin... ""Do you need to go to the bathroom?"" I said. No answer. Then I looked to my side and my cousin was sleeping. Man did my heart jump! I looked at the shadow again... I didn't know what I should do! All of a sudden I started to shake and I started sweating. My body went numb... Then everything went black. The next day I decided to sleep in another room!

Old Lady in the Mirror,"Pennsylvania, United States",Apparitions / Voices / Touches,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Apparitions / Voices / Touches :: Old Lady in the Mirror

B elieve it or not this happened to me when I was 6 years old. This experience haunted me for almost most of my life up until probably 3 years ago. My sisters and my brother would spend a lot of time at my Aunt's apartment in East Stroudsburg when my mother would work. My aunt insisted that her apartment was haunted. Of course my mother never believed her.

My older sister was playing upstairs in my aunt's room, while I sat on the chair by the door at the foot of the steps. I got a flash... Or a vision you may say of what she saw at the instant she screamed. I saw what she saw in the mirror before she came running down the stairs screaming hysterically.

Momentarily she looked at me and I looked at her and calmly told her I already saw what she saw. There was an old lady, looked very much like our mother with grey hair, and looked very much like a witch. I know that doesn't sound like much, however she has haunted my dreams ever since, like I said until recently. I told her I wasn't afraid her anymore, and that she needed to leave me alone.

Do you ever have dreams that seem more real then a dream, or been haunted by things in your dreams. I have... trust me there is another one, I told to go away along time ago. I will write about him... Or shall I say it later.

Startling Knocks At My Window,"South Carolina, United States",Misc,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Misc :: Startling Knocks At My Window

I have a habit of being awake in the wee hours of the morning on a fairly regular basis. This particular morning I was up late working on some music projects. I had my earbuds in listening to a track when suddenly I heard 3 loud rapid knocks right at the window behind my bed's headboard.

It scared the living s#!+ out of me! Startled, I snatched out my earbuds and laid low for a brief moment wondering who in the h*! Could be knocking on my window at this time of the morning. This has never happened before so I'm there ducked down trying to process what just happened.

In those brief moments my mind is racing and I thought for a second could it have been one of my household relatives that went outside and perhaps locked themselves out? Then I thought could it be someone from around the neighborhood up to no good or perhaps needing something?

Then I thought that maybe I was hearing things, but the knocking was LOUD and I actually felt the THUD of the window. That's actually what got my attention, and it was loud enough that I heard it beyond my earbuds.

I quickly jumped out of bed and grabbed my pistol. I then slowly peeped out the blinds of the window to see if anyone was out there but oddly there was no one there.

That side of the house is well lit by a nearby street light and my car was right there next to that window. Still peeping out the window I looked around the car and waited to see if maybe someone was hiding behind it on the other side, but I didn't see anyone. I angled my gaze downward to see if anyone might have ducked down below the window alongside the house but no one was in sight.

I then went out of my bedroom and slowly peaked around the corner into the front room to see if by chance anyone else was awake and happened to make a loud noise which I thought was at the window, but came from another part of the house instead. However, I saw that they were all sound asleep, snoring loudly.

I then peaked out the blinds in the front room (where my relatives were sleeping) to look out in the yard but I saw no one in the yard. If someone were to flee it would've took them a few minutes to get far enough to exit the yard, and they would've been well in view of the street light.

I went back in my bedroom and looked at the clock on my laptop. I saw it was 2:48, right before 3am (which is said to be ""Witching Hour""). At this point I'm on edge and starting to think that it may have been something paranormal happening.

For the sake of protection I burned some sage and told whatever it was to leave me alone and return where it came from.

I laid back down in bed on edge for the remainder of the morning until daybreak, but nothing else ever did happen.

The following night came and I again, was awake in the wee hours. Naturally I was on edge waiting for something to happen again but nothing ever did.

Rumor Or Real?,Japan,Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: Rumor Or Real?

T here is a small Japanese-style washoku restaurant I sometimes go to. It is an old place with a wooden sign and a sliding door. Inside the floor is covered with tatami, the tables are low, and the smell of grilled fish and dashi hangs in the air. The menu is fixed, with set meals of rice, miso soup, simmered vegetables, pickles, and fish.

People in the neighborhood have spoken about the place for years. They say that if you stay there too late, unusual things begin to happen. I never believed it until one night I went there with my friend.

It was close to closing time. The dining room was empty except for us. The waitress came to take our orders, bowed politely, and walked quickly down the corridor toward the kitchen. Her footsteps echoed unnaturally against the floor.

While we waited, the light above our table flickered. We both looked up, then shrugged it off. A few minutes later, a clatter broke the silence. A pair of chopsticks had fallen onto the tatami from the table next to ours. The strange thing was that no one had been sitting there.

Not long after, I felt a tap on my shoulder. It was light, like the touch of a waiter. I turned, but no one was there. When I looked forward again, the waitress was just then coming out of the kitchen, carrying our trays with both hands.

We ate quietly. The food was the same as always, but the silence of the room pressed down on us. After the last orders were served, the kitchen lights went out. I heard the faint sound of pans being stacked, and then there was nothing.

Suddenly a loud crash echoed from the kitchen. A pan had fallen to the floor. No one moved and no one spoke. The kitchen remained dark.

When the waitress returned with the bill, she said nothing about it. She bowed as usual, but I noticed her hand shaking slightly.

We paid quickly and left. As the sliding door closed behind us, the light above the entrance flickered once.

Later I tried to learn more about the rumors. I discovered that about fifty years ago, the owner of the restaurant had a violent quarrel with his wife. He struck her, not realizing she was pregnant. The baby was lost. The woman's mind gave way after that. Some time later she killed him in the restaurant's kitchen.

It is said that the man still lingers in the dining room, and the woman remains in the kitchen, waiting for the one who took her child.

When I think back to the tap on my shoulder and the chopsticks falling from the empty table, I cannot help wondering which one of them it was...

"Did They Fade, Or Do They Remain?",Japan,Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: Did They Fade, Or Do They Remain?

I live in Hokkaido, and my yard used to have an old well. It had been there long before I moved in, tucked away behind shrubs and an aging shed. I rarely used it, maybe only only once in a while for watering plants? But otherwise it sat quietly, almost forgotten.

The area where I live has long had a reputation for being haunted. Over the years I've grown used to it. Sometimes, in the middle of the night, faint voices can be heard, like distant prayers carried on the wind. They've weakened as time has passed, and I've come to accept them as part of the atmosphere here.

But what happened when I arranged to close the well felt entirely different.

In the days leading up to the ceremony, strange things began to occur. At night, dogs from far-off homes barked and howled in the direction of my property, though there was nothing visible in the yard. Inside my own house, I would wake to muffled knocking sounds, low and insistent, as though coming from beneath the ground.

The night before the priest was due to arrive, I saw something I still can't explain. At dusk, I noticed a shape near the well. At first it looked like an animal crouched close to the ground, but as I focused on it, the form seemed to stretch upward, taking on the blurred outline of a person. It never came into focus... Always shadowy, indistinct... Before vanishing altogether. When I went to check, the ground around the stones was damp, though it hadn't rained in days.

On the morning of the ceremony, the air in the yard felt unusually heavy, as though the place itself was holding its breath. The priest performed the purification, but later admitted it had been harder than usual, as if something resisted the prayers.

When the ritual was finished and the well was sealed, the disturbances ceased. The dogs grew quiet, the knocking sounds never returned, and I haven't seen that shadowy figure again.

Even so, the memory lingers. The distant prayers that sometimes drift through my area feel familiar now, almost harmless. But the things I experienced during the well-closing were different... Very active, immediate, and unsettling in a way I won't soon forget.

Do you think the spirits tied to the well are still here, or did they fade away like the voices of those midnight prayers?

A Haunted Well,India,Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: A Haunted Well

"" This is something that happened to my mother around 45 - 50 years ago...""

During her childhood, my mother used to spend her summer holidays in a small village called Naginenipally, at her eldest sister-in-law's house. Like most children of her age, she was playful, curious, and a little adventurous.

In that village, there was an old well that everyone whispered about. The elders often warned children to stay away from it, saying it was haunted. Naturally, this only fueled the curiosity of the kids.

One day, when all the elders were busy with work, my mother and her close friend slipped away to see the well for themselves. They played around it for some time. Neither of them knew how to swim, so they never dared to get too close. But then something terrifying happened.

Out of nowhere, a woman draped in a black saree appeared. She was carrying burning coal wrapped in her saree, yet the cloth did not catch fire. With a swift motion, she threw the burning coal in front of the children. Shocked and terrified, the two girls ran back to the house, trembling with fear.

Days later, despite the incident, their curiosity got the better of them. They returned to the well. But this time, what they experienced was even more chilling.

From deep inside the well, they began to hear a voice calling out the name of my mother's friend. At first faint, it grew louder and louder, echoing through the air until it felt unbearably close.

The girls fled in horror. That very night, my mother's friend developed a high fever. Even as she lay in her home, she claimed to hear the same voice calling her name again and again.

Though her fever eventually subsided, she never recovered from the fear. Within a few days... She passed away.

I Would Have Been Late,Canada,Family / Friends Visits,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Family / Friends Visits :: I Would Have Been Late

M y Mother passed away in April 2022, though I have been thinking to share the interesting events that happened around that trying time, today I'm going to write about a little help she gave me this morning.

Today I had to go to work to a place a bit far from where I live and one of my coworkers was to pick me up at 6:00 AM.

Since this is way too early for the time I usually get up, I decided to sleep in my daughter's bedroom so not to disturb my husband's sleep. I prepared my stuff and a good lunch and set the alarm with enough time to let me get ready, have a good breakfast and tend to the cat's needs before leaving, I thought one hour and 20 minutes would be enough time to do everything without rushing.

Anyway, at some point I had a dream, perhaps even a nightmare, in which I was going to get together with my friends from university, they arrived at my place and I wasn't ready. I began looking for something to wear but couldn't find anything suitable, mismatched socks, flowery blouses and plaid skirts and homely dresses that would had made me look like a pauper beside my elegantly dressed friends.

I went out and told my friends that I'd be ready in two minutes, but was moving with the speed of a snail and knew I would make everyone else late for whatever event we were attending.

My parents were watching me from the background, and Mom said ""Se te va a hacer tarde"" (You are going to be late).

Hearing her voice was enough to wake me up startled, I checked my phone, it was 4:23 AM, still a bit earlier than the time I had set the alarm. I stayed few more minutes in bed but decided to turn off the alarm and get up. To my horror, I realized that I had set the alarm at 5:40 AM instead of 4:40 as I had intended!

Strange Voices In The Mountains,Japan,Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: Strange Voices In The Mountains

I went camping for two nights at a small site up in the mountains, next to a slow-moving stream. The water ran clear over stones, and deer wandered through the area occasionally, which is normal in Hokkaido. The air smelled damp and earthy, with a faint hint of pine.

I rode up on my side-car. The road was quiet, and the forest on either side felt still, but the ride itself was normal.

The first night was uneventful. I heard only the stream, the occasional rustle of leaves, and a few distant birds.

The second night was different. I woke sometime after midnight because the forest felt unusually still. The stream was quieter, and then I heard voices.

At first, they were faint, blending with the water. But it was clear they were human voices, not animal sounds. One voice, soft and high-pitched, sounded like a woman speaking in short, broken phrases. It drifted slowly through the area, fading in and out. I stayed still and listened. After a few minutes, the voices faded completely, leaving only the stream.

When I was leaving the next morning, I mentioned it to the caretaker. He didn't look surprised. He said quietly that people sometimes hear things in that part of the mountain, and that in the past, a few people have gone missing there. He didn't give any details, and I didn't ask.

I don't know what I heard that night. Maybe it was someone lost, maybe it was just the way sound carries in the forest. But the voices by the stream have stayed with me. What do you think those voices are? Are they victims or some sort of night creatures?

"Move To San Francisco, A Very Haunted City","California, United States",Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: Move To San Francisco, A Very Haunted City

O oookay, I was totally joking at the end of my last post when I said I'd post again in five years. But here it is, five years later. Looks like I'm going to be unintentionally posting every five years on here.

On 29 June 2021, I moved to San Francisco. It's where I'd always wanted to move, but couldn't for various reasons. Well, a really good friend of mine told me that I could live with them. They lived with their family and their family said I could stay until the end of the year, then I'd have to find my own place. That seemed perfectly fair.

In 2017, their grandmother passed away. I always assumed she passed away in the hospital because I remembered my friend telling me they rushed her to the hospital, and a few days later they told me she passed. But every time I was by the bathroom in front of her old room, I'd get this strange feeling there was a presence. That little hallway had that feeling. It didn't feel evil or scary, it actually felt calming. I told my friend, and they said, ""That's Baachan. She's watching over us"". My friend is Japanese and that's the term they call their grandmother. I asked if she passed in the hospital like I thought, and they said, ""No, she hated it there. We brought her home to rest in her own bed, and she passed away that night"".

However, the basement was another story. Or rather... First floor? Basements are weird here in San Francisco. In their house and the one I'm currently living, there are steps leading to second floor, which acts as the first floor. The ground floor is considered a basement even though it's fully above ground. I've lived here four years, and I'm still confused by it. I live on the third floor but it's technically the second floor...

Anyway, we had to go to the basement to do laundry. We never liked being down there because the air felt thick and evil. My friend's family had bought the house back in the 1950s and their mother had grown up in it, and she told me it was like that when she was a little girl. She hated being down there and doesn't go down there unless she has to. I asked if something happened down there and she said if it did it was before her family bought the house, but it definitely feels like some really bad energy is down there.

So, I got a job there, saved up and moved into my current house on 5 January 2022. I'm renting a room in a house, and it's a really nice neighbourhood in the Richmond. That's not doxing myself, the Richmond is fifty blocks long and like ten blocks wide. It's a very big area.

It didn't take me long to notice that the house was haunted. At least the hallway. Even in the daytime I feel like something is chasing me when I walk down it and I rush back to my room. A friend of mine looked up this address on SF Chronicles archives and found out there had been a murder here in the '80s. There weren't any specific details like if it was in the top floor hallway or something. But that's the only thing we found that could explain it.

There are four rooms on my floor. My room is at the end of the hall facing the outside. I look out my window and see the street. The room next to mine, there was someone living there when I moved out. He moved out a year into me living here and someone else moved in, he's still here. The room at the end of the hall, the same person has lived there since before I moved in. I mention all this to talk about the last room. I call it the middle room even though there are four rooms. I guess it'd be the middle room in that hall, since mine is at the end of the hall. Anyway, I've always called it the cursed room. The guy who was living there when I moved in moved out a month later. In the three and a half years I've lived in this house, we've had six different people move in and out. The short time was two weeks. I came home from work and he was moving his stuff out. I asked what was going on and he just said, ""I can't do this anymore"". I asked what he meant and he just repeated it. The current tenant there seems to be paranoid. When he moved in a couple months ago, he told me that he had to move out of his last place because his landlord was having the tenants spy on him. I was like, ""Oh, that's messed up!"". But then he started talking about hidden cameras in his room and I felt like maybe his last landlord didn't have him spied on. A couple weeks ago I was coming up the stairs from taking out the trash. His room is directly in front of the stairs, and as I was nearing the top, he opened his door and told me I needed to stop standing outside his door listening in. I was confused and he said, ""Don't bother denying it, I caught you three times"". The other way I was coming up the stairs from talking with a friend at the front door who had come to pick up something. As I was nearing the top he threw open his door and startled me. I laughed and told him he startled me. He goes, ""I told you to stay out of my room! You need to leave me alone!"". Honestly, I don't know if that has anything to do with the activity here or if he's just mentally ill, but I honestly wouldn't be surprised if there was a presence outside his room and he thinks it's one of us.

Something happened a couple of days ago that made me want to write all this down. Our bathroom is split between two rooms. Okay, from my room looking down the hall, on the left side are my roommates' rooms. On the left side is an empty closet, the stairs, and the two bathroom doors, and the kitchen at the end of the hall. The first bathroom is literally just the toilet, the size of a porta-potty. Really tiny. The second door is the shower and sink. It sounds inconvenient, but with four people living there, it's been very convenient. Anyway, a couple days ago I was in the first bathroom and I could hear someone taking a shower. I could see the light on, and the windows were open and I could very clearly hear the shower going. I was thinking to myself, ""I'll just wash my hands in the kitchen"", like we usually do in that situation. Well, I leave the bathroom, the sound still going and light still on through the window, and when I close the door behind me... The second bathroom door is open, and the light is off and no one is in there. No shower going, the floor and walls are dry. I stood there, my blood frozen. It was seriously eerie.

Okay, that's enough about my living haunting situations. I'll talk about my San Francisco working haunting situations. That's a weird wording, but I'm going to keep it.

First job I got was on Fisherman's Wharf at a souvenir shop standing outside going, ""Everything is $10!"". That was literally my entire job. That's the job that paid for me to move out of my friend's house. But a week after I moved into this house, the store abruptly closed. I frantically looked for another one and was lucky enough to find one with one day left in the month. My landlord is very understanding. It was an organic market on Polk, and I loved it there. A lot of the friends I have made here were either coworkers there or regular customers there. A minor celebrity was a regular there and she and I talked every week. It was so much fun working there! Even if it was haunted like crazy! There was the obvious stuff like stuff falling off shelves that weren't near the edge, stuff moving around or not where we left them. There were times we saw figures cross between aisles even though we knew no one else was in the store. I even had a similar experience that happened in Ohio. A coworker and I were discussing the hauntings, and a loaf of bread flew off the shelf and hit the counter. We decided to change the subject. The same thing happened in Ohio except it was a bag of chips.

In 2023 the store was bought by another, bigger store and closed down and we were all let go. I had saved up thousands of dollars by then, which was lucky because that paid my rent until I got another job in March 2024. My current job, in fact. I'm a photographer at a landmark. Obviously not going to say which one. We take pictures of guests as they enter and try to sell them souvenir sets of their photos as they leave. We all know the area is haunted, but it's hard to prove because we're outside. We just know mostly because we can feel it. There were two incidents that really solidified it, though. Several months ago, I opened up (I'm a lead there) and when I unlocked the office there were photo cards everywhere. I called the person who closed the night before and asked them what the heck happened. He was completely confused; it wasn't like that when he left. I knew he was lying so I had to report it to my district manager. An hour later she texted me a video showing that... It wasn't him. Oh, the photo cards are cards with QR codes we scan when we take the pictures and hand to the guests. There are 1,000 in each box. Anyway, there was an open box on the table in the office and in the middle of the night, they started flying out of the box of their own accord. I asked her if I could share the video and she said absolutely not. What's with corporate not wanting these things getting out? Honestly, I think that'd give us more visitors.

The other thing that happened was we often hear our names called from behind the sales area. There will be no one over there and one of us will hear our name being called from back there. No one else can hear it, but almost all of us have heard it. Even the skeptical ones have heard it, though they have tried to dismiss it as the wind. But it even happens when the wind isn't blowing, or even no breeze. The air could be still and we'll still hear it. It's always eerie. I've been working there for a year and a half and have heard it many times and am not used to it. We had a sixteen-year-old girl start working there last year. I was standing next to her on her first night and she suddenly screamed. I jumped and asked what happened. She said, ""I heard someone saying my name!"" and she ran behind the sales area and screamed again because no one was back there. I involuntarily laughed and said, ""Oh, you'll get used to that"", even though like I said I'm still not used to it. Needless to say, she quit after about a week. She said it was because she hated working outside, though.

I'm going to end this by talking about something nobody likes talking about. I've walked the Golden Gate Bridge so many times now that I don't even take pictures every time anymore. It's just a large bridge that just happens to be one of the most famous in the world. No big deal. But as I'm sure everyone knows, it's well-known for the unfortunately high number of people who have jumped off of it over the course of its existence. I don't know if you've walked on it, but you can definitely feel it when you're walking on it. There's an air of sadness when you're walking across it. No matter what I'm doing, be it listening to happy music or in a call with my best friend, there's an unmistakable feeling of sadness, dread, and regret when walking on that bridge. I've never specifically seen anything, but I think it's because I'm kind of sensitive to that sort of thing that I feel it so much. I've walked it with a friend of mine once who isn't sensitive to the paranormal and she didn't feel anything. Heck, at this point, I don't even know if what I feel on the bridge is even paranormal anymore. There's been so many jumpers over the past century, those emotions are essentially baked in by now. They have nets in place now so there have been less attempts lately. Someone did jump a couple months ago. I saw him lying on the net refusing help. Last I saw, they were guiding him off. So, the nets are definitely saving lives. Either as a deterrent or by literally catching people who try.

Is Someone Visiting?,"Texas, United States",Family / Friends Visits,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Family / Friends Visits :: Is Someone Visiting?

I t has been a VERY LONG time since I have visited YGS and had someone not reached out to me via FB I am not sure I would have returned, but here I am and a BIG thank you to the individual who reached out to me.

2024 was not a good year for myself or Family. In January we saw the passing of my Mother. Her health had been in decline (heart issues) and was in assisted living in the Dallas Tx area. In May we received the 'midnight' phone call that wakes you from your peace. My Oldest Son (Lawrence) had collapsed at work, he worked 3rd shift (overnights) at a Local Floor and Decor, and was pronounced dead at the scene. He had suffered a Bi-lateral pulmonary embolism. My Father -in-Law, who's health was failing (Type 1 Diabetes Complications) moved in us in June, by the first week of August he was placed on Home Hospice and passed away later that same month (yes, he passed in my house).

In the year since, some 'odd' things have happened either to individuals in the household or with-in the house itself.

1st: When home alone I hear someone moving upstairs in my Son's old room. I 'played' it off as it being our dog (a 13-14 year old 50-60 pound Huskey with a bad hip) only to realize he was at my feet as I sat on the couch. A quick 'cat check' shows that both of out cats are also in the living room with me.

2nd: Each Family member has felt Lawrence's presence at one time or another, up to and including hearing his voice saying something... Not sure if this is just us remembering how he would speak with us or if he is actually interacting with us still, but it's defiantly his 'sarcastic' / snarky type comments.

3rd: Not sure how people feel about seeing individuals that have crossed over in their dreams, but my Wife has had two very vivid dreams about Lawrence, she describes them as 'feeling' real. The first one he was comforting her because he had passed away, he assured her that 'he was needed' on the other side... The next day is when we received the coroner's report detailing what had caused his death... A pulmonary embolism, is enough to take someone, he had suffered a Bi-Lateral (one in both Lungs) Pulmonary Embolism and there was nothing that could have been done to prevent it. The other dream she described was 'just as real' but he was simply comforting her, at least that's all she could remember about it.

So, there it is... 2024 was a very rough year for our Family, still dealing with so, so many things from last year, but making progress. Thanks for reading.

Am I Losing The Plot?,United Kingdom,Misc,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Misc :: Am I Losing The Plot?

A t the end of May this year, I lost my umbrella. This fact had me very confused as I do not use my umbrella very much, and usually use it to walk to the gym when it's raining. Just as info, I have zero psychic ability. None. But I have been reading stories on YGS for over 10 years as I find the subject interesting.

I looked everywhere for this umbrella. I live in a Victorian terrace with limited space so there are a finite number of places to look. I even went to my car and checked in there. On the back seat of my car, behind the driver, I keep two cloth shopping bags and I moved them out of the way to look at the back seat (even though I can't imagine why I would put it on the back seat) but I saw nothing. Each week these 2 bags would be used and returned to the same spot. Shortly before I was due to go on holiday the 3rd week of June, I returned my bags to the back seat and there sat my umbrella. I was quite nonplussed. I was sure that I had carefully looked at the back seat weeks before. I park as close to my front door as I am able because parking is first come first served.

I got back from my holiday, and on June 3rd I was making something to eat, and reached into a lower cupboard for a can of baked beans. I always have baked beans - they are a staple. My hand grabbed air. I bent down to have a look, stuck my hand into the space where there should have been cans, put my arm all the way to the back and zilch. No beans. I was really surprised that I had run out as I hate running out of anything. Next day when I did some shopping I bought a couple of cans to go in the cupboard. When I tried to insert the new cans I heard a clink. I looked into the cupboard and there were two cans of beans there. As you can imagine, I was beginning to wonder if I was losing the plot.

On the 10th of July (and this is where I went back and wrote dates down) I took a bus to meet someone for coffee in a town about 3 miles away. While I was on the bus I looked at my hands and noticed that I had not put on my rings and bangle. A few months ago I realized that I really should wear my jewelery more as it was silly to leave it in the jewelry box, so I had two rings resized and started wearing them more. The only problem is that at times the rings and bangle get really annoying. When home, I often put them on my computer desk and put them on from there before I go out. If they annoy me when I am out I pull them off, and slip them into the front zip pocket of my shoulder bag. I thought about when I had last seen the jewelry and could not remember seeing the pieces by the pc before I left, so I thought that perhaps I had forgotten to take them out of my handbag after the last time I wore them. I unzipped the front pouch, which is probably about 25cm x 20cm, slid my hand back and forth and resolved to look for the rings and bangle when I got home as the pocket was empty. Had my coffee, got on the bus to go home and started to put my bus pass into the front zip pocket. As soon as I slipped my hand in, I felt my bangle which is gold and fairly heavy and noticeable, and the rings were there too.

After the beans incident I had started to wonder if I had a spirit in my home with me, and the jewelry incident really reinforced that thought except for one thing. I was a couple of miles from home when I found the empty pocket, and about 3 miles away from home when I could feel my stuff again. And this is where I really started to wonder if I was losing it. How did ""my"" spirit know that I would be looking for my jewelry on the bus, and how did it put it back in for me when I was not at home? Can these entities move around with you?

I have been meaning to set up an account here, but I am a great procrastinator. Yesterday I was sitting in my recliner for a few minutes before going out. I had been ready to post everything after I set up an account, but I procrastinated for a couple of weeks, and then yesterday something new happened. I leave my Kindle Fire on the arm of my recliner. It was unplugged and to my left while I checked something out before leaving. I looked over and it turned on. Now, if there is no power plugged in, I must hold the power button to a 5 count before it turns on, so somebody was trying to be helpful, which it would have been if not for the fact I was going out.

I am of an age where quite a few people have Alzheimers and/or dementia, and I really would rather not join that group, so if someone with more knowledge than me would care to comment on the question of can spirits follow you around locally, I would be relieved if some do and that I am still sane.

A Shadow In The Forest,Japan,Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: A Shadow In The Forest

I have lived in Hokkaido for ten years. A few days before the event, I visited Nibutani, a village where the Ainu people preserve their culture and traditions. An elder told me about Ke-saru, a spirit said to live deep in the forest and watch those who enter.

He explained,""Ke-saru doesn't chase people, but it watches carefully. If someone is careless or disrespectful, it takes more than just fear.""

The name Ke-saru means""face peeler""in the Ainu language, referring to the spirit's dangerous nature toward those who show arrogance or disrespect in the forest.

Before I left, the elder taught me a prayer to say if I ever felt the spirit nearby,""Kamuy ceppesuy."" This means,""Spirit, please return to your home."" The Ainu believe that spirits called kamuy live in all parts of nature, animals, plants, rivers, and the wind.

While hiking alone in the Hidaka Mountains, the air suddenly became cold. All birds singing, wind rustling leaves stopped completely. Then, I saw a dark shape moving slowly between the trees. It was too large and moved too quietly to be a bear or any animal I know around.

At that moment, I felt a heavy pressure and had difficulty breathing. Remembering the elder's words, I whispered the prayer,""Kamuy ceppesuy.""

For several seconds, the Shadow stayed still before silently disappearing into the darkness.

When I returned to Nibutani and told the elder what happened, he said, ""It saw you. You are lucky it let you go.""

Since then, I have avoided walking alone in that part of the forest. The silence and shadows are not just empty, they feel like something is watching.

Did I encounter the Ke-saru or can anyone explain what happened?

Spirits From Ripley's,"Florida, United States",Ghost Tours & Haunted Hotels,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Ghost Tours & Haunted Hotels :: Spirits From Ripley's

R ipley's Believe It Or Not seems to have more than just artifacts from different locations around the world. Some seem to be there from the Paranormal Realm, which I had the opportunity to investigate and experience.

Just like at the Old Jail, you go through a little bit of an introduction, a run over of the gear that they have to let you use, then you are released to investigate the building. I was not expecting all the activity that we had the opportunity to witness, and it definitely itched the scratch of wanting to get some interactions to see if there was paranormal activity.

This location gave more EVP evidence than anything else. Which part of it was receiving the name Steve a few times. Then there was a time frame where it said ""switch"", which I was there with a friend, and asked if it wanted me to hand the spirit box to my friend, which we received the response ""yes"" and it then proceeded to whistle at him a few times.

At this location, we were not receiving very many spirit orbs, but was a lot more heavy on the Voice Phenomena when we were asking questions. Now the one time that I had some concern was mentioning that I was going to go downstairs, and got a very heavy, deep, angry sounding NO! Response through the spirit box, which, much to say, I did not go downstairs at that point.

Then towards the end of the investigation, we were standing in one of the exhibits and received the response ""Die"" or ""Will Die"" and at that point my buddy as well as myself were like, nope we are stepping out of this room and going elsewhere.

Either way, that was my first investigation before doing the Old Jail investigation and hope that you guys enjoyed reading this.

Ghosts Of The Old Jail,"Florida, United States",Ghost Tours & Haunted Hotels,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Ghost Tours & Haunted Hotels :: Ghosts Of The Old Jail

I figured I would share a story of one of the experiences that I have had in my life, that I feel like was the most interesting encounters that I have had to this day.

A friend and myself had gone to St. Augustine in Florida, and while there, noticed that the old jail had these paranormal investigations that you could pay to go on at night. Now to start it out, they didn't give too long in there. If I remember correctly you would be allowed to investigate on your own, but after receiving a short introduction and a quick run through of the equipment that they would let you use while there. All together I think we were allowed like 30-45 minutes for the investigation after all the intro and run through with the equipment was done.

But this was my second time doing an investigation, and the whole time they were doing the introductions outside, I could feel some eyes on me from inside the old jail. I remember it was the second floor off to the left side as you look at the Old Jail from outside. Then when we walked inside, we were able to get our hands on some equipment and investigate.

So we started out in the kitchen, and were not really receiving anything there, and proceeded to move over to the cells and see what was out there. Which we didn't really receive anything there, and proceeded to go to the Solitary Confinement Cells. That is where the real stuff kicked off. We didn't capture any EVP's but we did receive spirit orbs (which I had caught on camera) and there was a point when I captured the sounds of feet shuffling on camera.

Now with that, we kept getting spirit orbs every time when we would mention the sheriff, and then we went up to where the sheriff lived when he was over the prison, and caught more spirit orbs as well. When we were checking around in there, I had stepped to the side and received a tug on my shirt, which kind of startled me.

That was one of two investigations that was done in St. Augustine and will be writing the story of the other investigation that we had done, and would love to share that story with you guys as well. Also in regards to the story, if there is interest in seeing the video footage from the old jail, I have those uploaded on my YouTube channel, and can share that link with those that are interested in it.

"Visiting Shaft No. 4, An Old Coal Mine In Hokkaido",Japan,Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: Visiting Shaft No. 4, An Old Coal Mine In Hokkaido

I recently visited an old coal mine near Yubari called Shaft No. 4. It closed many years ago and is now abandoned.

The rusty gate at the entrance was cut open. I took a flashlight and walked inside. The air was cooler and damp, smelling like earth and rust. The tunnel walls were rough stone, and my flashlight only lit a small part ahead.

It was very quiet except for my footsteps. After a while, the air got colder. I could see my breath even though it wasn't cold outside. Then I heard some soft tapping sounds coming from deeper in the tunnel where I couldn't see.

The tapping didn't sound natural. It was like someone walking carefully. I stopped and listened, but the tapping stopped after a few seconds. It felt like something might have been there, just out of sight.

After that, I thought I heard faint whispers, but I couldn't make out any words. It was a quiet sound, and it felt like a warning to leave.

A sudden chill ran through me, and I felt uneasy. When I turned to head back, I saw a shadow move quickly along the wall. I shined my flashlight there, but there was nothing. The darkness seemed deeper than before.

Outside, the sun was setting, but the cold feeling and quietness stayed with me. The usual sounds felt far away.

Even now, I think about that visit. It feels like the miners who worked and died there left a presence behind, a quiet feeling in the cold tunnels.

Visiting abandoned mines can be dangerous. The tunnels may collapse, and the air might be poor. If you go, bring a friend, wear boots and a helmet, carry a flashlight with extra batteries, and tell someone where you're going. Be careful and respect the place and its history.

Yubari was once a busy coal mining town from the early 1900s to the 1960s. Mining was difficult work, and many miners lost their lives underground. When coal demand dropped, the mines closed, and towns like Yubari became empty.

Visiting Shaft No. 4 connects me to that history. It also reminds me that some memories don't fully go away even in dark tunnels.

Encounter Of A Spirit Of A Spider?,Japan,Pets / Animals,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Pets / Animals :: Encounter Of A Spirit Of A Spider?

I had a dream. In it, I was in my hobby room where I keep all my tarantulas. Everything looked exactly the same as in real life, the shelves, the lighting, the soft hum of the air, the subtle warmth. It felt ordinary. But the silence carried a strange weight.

That's when I saw my oldest tarantula. The one who had passed some time ago. She didn't move, but somehow, her thoughts reached into me.

And yet I knew exactly who she meant. The Singaporean Blue. A beautiful spider I had planned to ship out the next morning.

In the dream, I didn't question how I knew, it just made sense. Her message didn't need to be spoken aloud.

I wanted to respond, but I knew I couldn't. Even within the dream, I understood this was a one-way message. I was only meant to receive.

When I woke up, sunlight filled the room. My packaging table was ready, the materials laid out neatly. I was supposed to ship the Singaporean Blue that very day. But the dream lingered.

And there she was. Curled gently around an egg sac. Quietly guarding it, protecting it.

If I had shipped her that day, the eggs might've been lost. She might have been harmed. I cancelled the shipment immediately and called my friend to explain. Thankfully, he understood.

I'm not claiming it was a ghost or something supernatural. But the dream gave me something I had no way of knowing. It changed what I did.

So if something speaks to you in a dream, gives you a message you couldn't have known otherwise, and alters your path, doesn't that make it an encounter? I don't know for sure. But I'm grateful I listened.

Hug Goodbye,Australia,Family / Friends Visits,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Family / Friends Visits :: Hug Goodbye

Y esterday an old friend of the family passed away. V didn't want anyone visiting toward the end, only her immediate family. I wanted so badly to spend more time with her but I respected her wishes.

About a year ago I knew something was wrong with her; it was a gut feeling and nothing more. As the months went by I dreamt about her a lot. In most of these dreams I'm standing on the road outside her house. I know I can't get in and I don't try. They're sad dreams. In one dream I find a path beside one of the front gates. I enter through this path, it leads me to their house. But the house isn't there, it's like it was never built and I can't find my way out again. All dreams are in daylight.

I never asked V if she was okay or if she was ill. A part of me knew not to and another part of me didn't want to know. She's never been the best when it comes to doctors and conversations relating to medical topics always fall flat.

About ten years ago V had another medical scare but came out without a scratch. With little to no medical treatment. She really thought she'd live forever and so did everyone else if we're honest.

Last night I was at home tidying up. While I was dusting a desk I felt V suddenly behind me. It was such a strong feeling and I could see her in my mind stood behind me. I didn't turn around but I said her name and the feeling got stronger still. I could see clearly in my mind how she was standing, what she was wearing, how her hair was styled, everything. In my mind I could see her touching my shoulders in a half hug, way you do when you're comforting someone. When V touched my shoulders there was such an intense unmistakable feeling of her being right there. After a moment I shook the feeling off and walked away because I didn't want this to be what I believed it to be. Wish I hadn't done that.

Last night I kept dreaming of V. Just random stuff like sitting in their kitchen chatting, their dogs being rowdy. One dream was of one of her lampshades which she made for me when I was a wee lass. I have it sitting out ready for an old lamp that needs rewiring.

Today I got the call that she had passed away. I don't know what time it happened, only that it happened yesterday.

While I was on the phone the call kept going into static sounds. At one point the phone beeped a long kind of 'beep' sound. Never heard my phone make that noise. I was talking to my dad, who informed me. The paranormal is a no go topic for him so I didn't bring it up, not sure if he heard anything on his end.

I know it sounds cliché but V's always been an inspiration to me. In that she's always been unapologetically herself. Her passion for antique everything was completely unmatched and her home was the most haunted place I've ever known. I wrote about their ghosties years ago on here. The eccentric couple with the big ole posh place.

V was born into extreme wealth but was a hippy and artist at heart. Never worked a day in her life. Dedicated much of her time to helping others. She was so generous with people, often times to her own detriment. She would often have people in need live with her, usually recovering addicts. Which was often dangerous as V and her husband are big into recreational substances. It usually ended badly, very badly. V was beaten up a few times by some of the people she took in. Her heart was always in the right place but she could be very naive.

I don't think it's completely sunk in yet. I thought writing about last night would make me feel something but I'm kind of just numb.

On a slightly unrelated note about a year ago I was watching a horror on Netflix. In this movie someone holds a duck out from around a doorway or around a corner or something. It's a white duck and someone holds it out so it's like looking at you from the doorway. It's a silly quirky scene but it scared the bejesus out of me. For anyone who may remember, when I wrote about V's place years ago I wrote about a duck puppet that stuck its head around the doorway when we were kids. I thought V's daughter had done this and ran towards the puppet but nothing was there. So, did someone from Netflix read that or what?

The Haunting Of Willows Apartments,"Nebraska, United States",Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: The Haunting Of Willows Apartments

I 'm here to talk about my experiences as a kid in the Willows Apartments. I'm not sure why no one talks about them much, but that place is hell.

When I was just 9-10 years old, I had a very bad experience and very negative. My mom had stayed here when we moved in, I knew something was badly off. I started noticing it when mom would get angry more and easier. I knew being a single parent was bad enough and ever since I was a kid, I'm a magnet for spirits and demonic entities. It's terrifying when you're just a kid.

It started off when moms' emotions would increase, the smallest things could set her off. I could understand why maybe it was stress until... That quickly changed. Started to hear footsteps at night, knockings, slamming kitchen cabinets would wake me up. I thought it was mom, but I would get up and to find her always fast asleep.

One day a childhood friend of mine came to stay the night little did I know that was the last night we stayed there; we encountered evil. My friend and I were in the bedroom playing with toys, when all the sudden I saw a shadow dark run across the wall. I pointed at it and asking her did you see that she looked at me in fear like she saw the whole thing not just a shadow. I screamed for my mom, tears down my face, ""I saw it! I saw a shadow!""

My mom saw my fear and felt it. She contacted her close friend and we cleansed what we could of out apartment and never looked back.

Later that week mom found out that the buildings were built on very bad Indian burial ground, many deaths followed, and the apartments continue to haunt the living to this day.

Unexpected Messages From Loved Ones,"Georgia, United States",Photographs / Videos / EVP,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Photographs / Videos / EVP :: Unexpected Messages From Loved Ones

I t's been a longtime away from the site, just busy but I'm now officially an empty nester and had some extra time to catch up with you all here.

I wanted to document two recent instances of EVPs that just happened unexpectedly, plus something related to the empty nester thing.

First, I was videoing some birds gathering in a tree in my back yard in early spring. They were making a ton of noise eating on the berries and I thought to send the video to my husband at work so walked out to record them. On the way back inside, as it was cold, I yet again didn't tap the off button properly to turn off the video recording (I'm so bad with my phone) so ended up with footage of the birds and the ground as I was walking back inside. But upon playback, as I'm crossing the patio, one can hear a fairly obvious EVP of a voice saying, ""OOH RAH,"" which is what U.S. Marines say... All the dang time. My late husband Scott was a Marine (as is my current husband). If current husband had been in the house, I might conclude the voice was his, but this morning he was already AT WORK. I can't imagine any of my elderly neighbors hollering like a Marine, so I'm left thinking it was Scott, yet again finding a way to be heard on a random day. He died from brain cancer in 1993 at age 32.

Then, last week, went to visit family graves at the cemetery where my aunt was recently interred. Scott's plot is just across the small interior street from my mom's. You can stand at mom's grave and see his and vice versa. Anyway, I decided to record as I walked up, because last time I was there I got an EVP. This visit, a woman's voice on video says, ""It's a woman"" as I'm walking to the gravesite. I stand there a minute and look over to Scott's grave and pretty sure there was a tear falling as I walked back down a slight hill to my car. The same woman's voice says, ""It's ok"" on my video recording. Easily heard, much appreciated.

Finally, Mom had given me a silver bracelet at the time of her diagnoses with cancer in 2013. I'm not much for jewelry, but I wore this bracelet every day. Sometime at the beginning of the covid lockdown, I lost it. Obviously not going anywhere, but it just sort of disappeared and over the last four years I've looked everywhere and yes, it did cross my mind that it was significantly from my mom.

Well, I have four kids and the last of them graduated from high school this spring. I've been raising kids 36 years and am 64 now, so it's going to be great as these last two finish college and join their siblings in adulthood. We had a large graduation party and that day I went into the closet where Mom's china (she left me) is kept to get a platter. I had to move a silver gravy boat out of the way to get to it and guess what just happened to be in the gravy boat? Right -- Mom's silver bracelet! Found on the day of the last kid's graduation, an occasion I know Mom would've loved. There is NO reason for that bracelet to have been there these last four years! I can't help but think it was yet another message from Mom.

The Cry In The Tunnel,China,Ghost Tours & Haunted Hotels,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Ghost Tours & Haunted Hotels :: The Cry In The Tunnel

A few years ago, I visited Harbin during the coldest part of winter.

The city was covered in deep snow, and the air was sharp and dry.

Walking through the streets, everything felt quiet and still - a kind of stillness that comes with extreme cold.

I had come as a tourist, interested in both the city's architecture and its history.

One site in particular stood out on the map: the Unit 731 Museum.

Unit 731 was a former covert military facility operated by the Imperial Japanese Army during World War II.

It served as a research base for biological warfare. Inside, human experiments were conducted (studies on frostbite, intentional infection with disease, and live vivisections.)

Thousands of people, many of them civilians and prisoners of war, died as a result.

The lighting is dim, and many areas of the building have been left in their original condition.

The displays include photos, documents, and preserved medical tools.

At one point, a guide pointed to a stairway leading underground and said,

""That tunnel leads to the prisoner cells. You may go down alone if you'd like.""

The tunnel was narrow, the walls damp. The air was colder than above.

Water dripped steadily from the ceiling, and the passage echoed faintly with each step.

Continuing forward, I heard another sound... Faint, possibly a voice.

It resembled a quiet whisper, unclear""Ahma."" (probably mother in Chinese)

Then I heard what sounded like a slow exhale close to my ear.

Back in the main building, I told a staff about what I had experienced.

She said, ""Many people hear things in that tunnel. Some things stay, even when they're gone.""

Though I don't claim to understand what I heard or felt, the visit to Unit 731 left an impression, not through horror or theatrics, but through the weight of documented history and preserved space.

It is a reminder of what human beings are capable of and why some places should be preserved, not forgotten.

The 3 A.m. Sleep Paralysis And Vivid Dreams,India,Old Hags / Night Attacks / Sleep Paralysis,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Old Hags / Night Attacks / Sleep Paralysis :: The 3 A.m. Sleep Paralysis And Vivid Dreams

The story is of my best friend. Let's call him Kapil. I am an eye witness of this.

This all happened during the lockdown in 2021. Kapil, my best friend, had been telling me about these really vivid and scary dreams he was having, always between 2 and 3 AM. He also mentioned experiencing sleep paralysis.

One day, with our exams approaching, I went over to his place for a night study session. It got pretty late, and around 1 AM, we decided to call it a night and get some sleep. We were sleeping in the same room, but our beds were on opposite walls.

Around 3 AM, I was jolted awake by a faint rustling sound. I sat up in my bed, and when my eyes landed on Kapil, a chill shot down my spine. He was thrashing, desperately trying to move, but couldn't, and his eyes were wide open. I immediately knew it was sleep paralysis.

Without thinking, I grabbed my water bottle and sprinkled a few drops on his face. It worked! He snapped out of it. But just as he did, we both heard it - the distinct sound of a plate dropping in the kitchen.

We were both instantly terrified. Neither of us dared to go check it out. Then, to our horror, the same sound came again. We just stayed frozen in our beds, listening.

After a few tense moments, we both started to relax a bit. I asked Kapil what had happened to him. He whispered that a ""totally black shadow"" had come and sat on his chest. He said he tried desperately to scream or even move his hands, but he couldn't. It was a truly terrible night for us.

After that night, I never tried to sleep at his home again. Kapil later told me that he continued to experience such incidents. Now he's in the UK, so I don't talk to him as much about it, but that night is something I'll never forget.

A Bizarre Encounter At The Olde Angel Inn,Canada,Ghost Tours & Haunted Hotels,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Ghost Tours & Haunted Hotels :: A Bizarre Encounter At The Olde Angel Inn

A t the early morning hours of May 25th, 1813, American military forces had launched a third invasion attempt against Canada. After U.S. Naval vessels had arrived along the shores of the Niagara River, a relentless two-day assault commenced against the British defense stronghold of Fort George. Despite valiant efforts to defend the fort, the Redcoat defenders were soon overwhelmed by the invading forces and had no other option than to abandon the fort. The Americans soon stormed into the adjacent town of Newark (modern day Niagara on the Lake) with the intentions of burning it to the ground. The siege ultimately led to a local tavern known as the Harmonious Coach House, where a British officer named Captain Colin Swayze would meet his tragic demise.

In order to flush out any enemy troops hiding within the tavern's basement, American soldiers took their bayonets and began systematically impaling the wooden wine barrels as well as any other objects capable of concealing any potential hiders. After being spotted within the confines of an empty barrel, Captain Colin Swayze was promptly stabbed and succumbed to his injuries almost immediately. (Mysteries of Canada, 2024)

Eventually, the Harmonious Coach House was renamed the Olde Angel Inn. Due to the utter brutality of Captain Swayze's death, it comes as no surprise that his restless spirit continues to linger aimlessly throughout the inn. Nestled within the heart of Niagara on the Lake, the Olde Angel Inn remains a popular destination for those intrigued by the many alleged hauntings reported over the span of several years. Being highly publicized in multiple paranormal reality shows, it becomes rather easy to understand why the inn receives such high amounts of revenue in tourism on an annual basis.

My first and only trip to the Olde Angel Inn happened back in August of 2006. I was accompanied by my mother, as well as my sister and brother. We had been informed of an apparent incident that occurred at the inn years prior to our arrival, which fueled our interests to visit. It was said that the incident involved a young American woman visiting the town with a group of her friends and decided to spend the night at the renowned hotel. She apparently wore a T-shirt depicting the image of a waving American flag. After exiting her room and nonchalantly traversing the hall, she abruptly stopped in her tracks, as she claimed to have felt the intense sensation of being slapped across the face. Though there was no definite proof to explain the encounter, it could be surmised that the vindictive Captain Swayze still continues to express his distain for those who happen to share the same nationality as the lone individual responsible for his departure.

We had finally arrived at the inn in the late afternoon. Though we were all mildly nervous, we were still highly excited and decided to help ease the tension by making jokes about the encounters reported by former guests. After an evening of bike riding, followed by an extended tour of Fort George, we decided to head back to the inn and go to sleep. For the first couple of hours, I struggled to fall asleep. Once I had begun to gradually calm myself down, I began to drift off and abruptly awoke, feeling as if someone had forcibly grabbed my shoulders. I was perfectly aware that I was the only one fully awake, as the others were peacefully sleeping in the adjacent bedroom. Despite the bewildering experience, I soon managed to fall asleep and woke up the following morning feeling well rested. The hotel had even given us a certificate to confirm our stay at the inn. As a humorous gesture, my mother decided to hang the certificate on our refrigerator. In spite of the strange experience, I still hope to one day return to the Olde Angel Inn and perhaps share even more personal stories.

A Howling Ghost,"Massachusetts, United States",Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: A Howling Ghost

N ot too long ago from writing this story I had a major incident that inspired me to record it. Now in the other incident in my old house in Virginia, I mentioned I've never felt anything that would make me believe there's a ghost in my house in my new house up in Massachusetts, but that changed however.

Now let me start with the little stuff, stuff I just ignored. I moved into my house going on five years starting 2008. When I am alone and a dark room is nearby, I always feel a strong malevolent presence radiating from it. It feels like I'm being stared at. This presence gets EXTREMELY strong if I am not near a light, so strong that it makes me want to scream if I stay in it long. I experienced that when I went downstairs during the night for a drink and didn't turn on the foyer light because it shines up the stairs and might bother my family.

Sometimes randomly at night, my dogs get very upset and go crazy, these dogs are all bark but they bark at most unnatural disturbances. They will not bark if one of the family goes down even in pitch black. They won't bark if our cat wakes them up. They can literally tell if its something normally in the house causing it.

One night I heard what sounded like the middle of a wolf's howl while in the bathroom, and if you really need to know, I was getting a tissue. But back to the point at hand. It was like a continuous middle of a wolf's howl. Now I stood there listening to that for a minute, and then went back to my room, the sound faded to almost nothing, but here's where it scared the living heck out of me, the sound got louder again.

Now at this point I was freaked out, so I went back in the bathroom, and it quieted down to almost nothing again. But once again after a minute or so, it got louder. At this point I had had enough so I turned up my headphones to block out the noise. The feelings of malevolence have been a bit stronger during the night afterwords, and I have been frightened away from going downstairs during the night which never previously happened, it's mostly because I know I won't be able to handle it, you could think of it as I feel like I used to except always in pitch black normally. And I don't want to find out what the presence feels like in pitch black.

The only other incident is one night my sister's printer starting making very strange noises all on its own, computer was off. My sister wasn't even in the house she was at a camp. But the printer was making some really odd noises, it did the noise every 30 seconds or so around that, at first I thought someone was in the hall because it sounded like a door. But after the 20th door or so, I finally got sick of it and checked to see who was out there only to discover it was a printer, I cannot answer why the printer did what it did, it hasn't done it since and works fine for the record. And is fairly new.

Dining Room Ghost,"Missouri, United States",Family / Friends Visits,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Family / Friends Visits :: Dining Room Ghost

F irst of all, let me say this right off the top. This happened when I was a little baby, but I asked the person that this happened to and she said that it really did happen. I did not use real names.

Jeanette, my mom's best friend, lost her dad to suicide about 20 years ago. After the funeral, some of the people, including her brother and sisters, went back to Jeanette's house to crash the night. After everyone had cleaned up the kitchen and dining room, they went upstairs to bed.

About 2 in the morning, they heard a strange noise coming from the kitchen. Jeanette's brother, Todd, was picked to at the front of the line going downstairs. He had a bat in hand and when he turned on the kitchen light, he noticed nothing unusual. Just for grins, they decided to check the dining room. When they turned the light on, they were surprised, shocked even, to see the chair that Jeanette's father sat at was pulled out as if someone had been sitting there and a condensation ring as if someone had a drink sitting there.

They went upstairs and talked about what they had just seen. Everyone agreed that the chair the father would sit at was avoided. Needless to say, the next day when they saw everyone that was at the funeral, including my mom and dad, they told them what happened. To this day, the only explanation that they have is that their father came home for one last drink.

The Subtle Pounding,"Ohio, United States",Misc,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Misc :: The Subtle Pounding

I previously published a story called Eerie Things Started Happening to Me . Another thing that has been happening a lot since a few years ago is a subtle pounding. This happens about one night a month. In the silence of the night and only when I'm in the basement, I'll hear a subtle pounding that will go on anywhere from 10 minutes to 2 hours. I tried to ignore it, but it doesn't go away - it's not ""in my head."" Something is not ""normal"" about it, and pounding isn't a normal nightly noise. It sounds as if someone is very softly pounding the floor upstairs with his/her heal. It pounds about once every second.

A few times, in the pounding, I noticed what reminded me of the ""human flaw,"" that is, it wasn't exactly equally spaced every second, but slightly staggered at some points - imperfect. The pounding also seems to slightly vary in forcefulness too, as subtle as it is. One night, in the midst of the subtle pounding, this one particular pound was harder than the rest causing the floor to ""settle"" (make a 'crack' noise). It also made the dishes in the sink rattle. Every time I go upstairs to find it, it stops, and then starts again only after I've been sitting downstairs for several minutes. I walked around my basement listening very closely and realized that it is in fact real, and it very much seems to be coming from my kitchen floor.

One night, after listening to this subtle pounding, I was in the kitchen almost ready for bed. I heard a loud thud on the kitchen floor as if someone in the basement hit the ceiling with a rock. It hit directly under where I was standing as I could feel the vibrations in my feet and legs. It was way louder than the normal ""house settling.""

Was it a Dream?,United Kingdom,Family / Friends Visits,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Family / Friends Visits :: Was it a Dream?

I 'm not really sure if this is classed as a ghost encounter, I'm not sure what it is. So I'll let you decide! My Dad died suddenly just before Christmas last year (2006). He suffered a massive brain hemorrhage whilst at home last year, and was found by my Mum a couple of hours later. He was only 52 and in good health, so as you can imagine it was a massive shock to me and my family. He was a big guy, I thought he was invincible. He was my hero. We were all filled with the same regret of not being able to say goodbye. Such a sudden death brings a lot of feelings along with grief, and I felt totally at a loss. I wrote him a letter, which was placed in his coffin, as I couldn't think of any other way to say my goodbyes.

About 2 weeks after he died I had the most vivid, emotional dream I think I've ever had. I dreamt that I was in my car, in the driving seat, and suddenly my Dad appeared in the passenger seat. I remember feeling totally shocked, because in my dream I was totally aware of the fact that he was dead and therefore shouldn't be sat in my car! There were 2 or 3 people also sat in the backseat, although I can't remember who they were or what they looked liked. I asked my Dad what he was doing here and who were the people in the backseat? He said that he'd come to visit me and the people were here with him as he wasn't allowed to visit on his own yet.

I was so happy to see him, I immediately told him that we had to go and find my Mum and brother who were at a local supermarket as they had to see him. He told me he couldn't because he had to go. I began to cry and was begging him to stay. I leaned over and hugged him, still crying uncontrollably, and he then said ""don't worry, it's safe and warm where I am"" and then ""it's fluffy!"" I was still holding him when he kind of just faded away, along with the people in the back. I was left on my own in the car, crying, when I suddenly woke up.

I laid there and was so stricken with grief that I continued crying almost uncontrollably for quite a while. It felt like I had my Dad back and then lost him all over again. I was very upset from this dream for about a week as I couldn't shake the feeling that it was actually him, and he had come to visit me.

I'm fully aware that due to my state of mind and the fact I hadn't said goodbye, my mind could have created this dream, as it was what I was longing for most. I would have given anything to get my Dad back, and I know that dreams often just convey what is going on in the depths of your mind. But what surprised me was the realness of the dream, and the fact that I could physically feel the emotions I did in my dream, grief, shock etc.

But I also think that it's possible that it was a visit. Dreams can take you anywhere you want to go, and surely if it was just a dream, why wasn't he alive and well? I really don't know what to think of if. I've asked a couple of friends who are mediums and they said it's very possible that it was actually him. I've also been told that the people with him are guides and they supervise new spirits on visits.

I'm not religious at all, so his description of being ""safe and warm"" doesn't signal to me that he's in heaven, maybe he is, I can't comment on whether heaven is real because I've never been! My Mum, brother and sister all had dreams that he visited them too, and a few other strange coincidences also happened shortly after.

So what do you guys think? Was it him? Or just a dream, my mind letting me see him because that's what I wanted most in the world? I think it's also worth noting that shortly after my Grandad died a few years ago, my Mum had a very similar dream (he was her dad). And she also said that he was with some people she had never met. Maybe my brain just replicated that dream, a way of helping my state of mind?

I'm a true believer in ghosts and all things paranormal, but I'm also a very level headed, rational person. I have crazy dreams all the time, so I'm fully aware that it could be JUST A DREAM! I'm interested to know if anyone has had a similar experience, especially concerning the 'guides' that appear to accompany the person.

Hovering Vacuum Cleaner,United Kingdom,Poltergeists / Physical Manifestations,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Poltergeists / Physical Manifestations :: Hovering Vacuum Cleaner

I don't really like stories that are posted on behalf of someone else, I think it often damages the credibility. I'm only submitting this story because I believe 100% that it is real. It is an encounter that happened to my best friend Max. He's the kind of best friend that you consider more to be family than a friend, and I have no reason to believe that he made this up, he's not the sort of person to make things up just to scare people. Also, it took me a couple of years to get him to tell me these experiences, as he's not really a believer of paranormal things, although if this happened to me I know I'd believe for sure!

When Max was 9 or 10, he used to live in a small 2 bedroom terrace house here in the south of England (just outside Portsmouth if you're interested), at the time he lived with his Mum and older brother. This is exactly how he told the story to me, so if it lacks detail, I apologize. He woke up in the middle of the night, and went downstairs to get a drink, as he got to the bottom of the stairs and turned the corner to walk towards the kitchen, he instantly froze. In the small hallway, was the vacuum cleaner. It was one of the upright type cleaners, with the big bag on it, and it was hovering all by itself! It was not plugged in and there was no noise coming from it. It was just gliding back and forth.

Understandably he didn't get a drink, he just ran back up to bed and hid under the covers. He never saw it happen again. But he did see a heavy clock fly off the wall. His friend and Mum saw it too. It was screwed to the wall with two screws, yet it just flew off the wall. His friend never went back into his house.

I think he's experienced other things but he's a bit weary of telling me. Like I said, I really don't like posting someone else's story, I wasn't there so I can't state whether it is true. But I do know Max, and I trust him with my life, and I honestly believe these things happened. I know everyone says that when posting someone else's story, so you'll just have to take my word that I'm not just really gullible!

Dreaming About my Uncle,Brazil,,"L ast year in March, me and my family (grandma, uncle, aunt and cousins) went to the beach during Carnival. I had to come back because I had to work but they stayed there. One day in the morning someone called us, it was my aunt and she informed us that my uncle had passed away.

We were shocked and I cried a lot. My brother got so mad cause he was his godfather and stopped talking for like, 2 days I guess... During the night people were on the mortuary chapel and I went home. I couldn't go inside and see his body, otherwise I would start to cry again and again.

I barely slept that night, but I had a dream with him. He was playing cards with 3 other people and I was on his side just looking. Then he looked at me and said:

And the other day we buried his body and I told one of my aunt' sister bout it. I only told my cousin and aunt bout that dream 1 month later the funeral and they smiled and said it was probably really him.

Since that day I didn't dream about him but a friend of mine saw him this year during Carnival at our home on the beach. He was covered in light and I guess he was just looking if I was ok.

My Cousin,"New York, United States",Psychic / Medium,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Psychic / Medium :: My Cousin

O ne night, when my dad came home from a night out with his friends, he walked down the stairs and I saw a cousin that had died a while back coming down the stairs behind him. The only thing I can honestly say that frightened me was his eyes. Why? Because the ghost (my cousin) looked at me back with very wide eyes, like in a way the ghost was surprised that I could see him. When I turned to tend to my baby sister, he was gone. He appeared like a real person (in flesh). When my father came down stairs I asked him if that cousin have a twin brother and he said no, and then I asked ""then who was the guy behind you?"". My whole family froze. And that was the end of that story but I have others too.

Most of my childhood was filled with sighting and dreams I just don't remember them all, my mother remembers most of them. I never told anyone beside my family, my mom never let me, she always said people will make fun of me.

I see what my mother meant now people today really don't believe in ghosts or sightings of any kind but that's okay, everyone is simply different. I feel it's a gift from god. I love to read about sightings, it's great that there are sites like this one.

Fiance's Visit,"California, United States",Family / Friends Visits,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Family / Friends Visits :: Fiance's Visit

I read a story a couple of months ago about a woman who lost her fiance in an accident, but I was too upset over losing dave to respond to her story. I too lost my love in January this year. He was on a motorcycle and drinking and the bike hit a curve and he flipped. He had just dropped me off in Great Lakes 3 days earlier on a long road trip we had together.

A few nights after, we disconnected life support and I was back in Great Lakes in the hotel room he had taken me to and I woke up because there was a lot of pressure on my body and I felt like I was being pushed down into the bed. At first, I thought I might be dreaming so I started to try and wake up all the way. I was on my back and my arms were straight down by my side. I never sleep that way. I am all over the place and I have a bad back so that would not have felt very good.

After a little bit of struggle I realized I was fully awake and still be held down. I wanted to make sure it was real so I tried moving my legs, arms, head and body but I was being held tight to the bed and I could not call out. I did not move and didn't panic, but started to try to fight the restriction.

Finally it was like my arms and legs and body were set free and I called out his name. I sat up and turned on the lights and got up and walked around but nothing else happened. I felt something in the room but nothing happened the rest of the night or since then. We were very close and I felt like he was letting me know he was with me because I was alone and the next day I would have to start a very hard job.

I was wondering if anyone else has had that happen to them. I have never had anything like that happen before. I was not scared because somehow I knew it was him. What was he doing?

"Not Scared, Just Interested","New York, United States",Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: Not Scared, Just Interested

H i I'm 13 years old and I have always been amazed with ghosts and spirits, I have always wanted to visit a haunted house. I finally got what I wanted when we moved into a new house. We moved into the house a about week before halloween, everything was fine for the first 2 months. It was close to midnight I believe, and I was going to bed and I got this REALLY weird feeling from my door way, like someone was watching me, I turned around and saw nothing, so I let it be for the night.

It happened at least once a week, and I just started to think I was watching too many ghost shows. My friend WinterG (I'm not using her real name) came over for a weekend and we were both downstairs. I hadn't told her about the weird feeling in my doorway because she freaks out when she hears about ghost stuff. She went upstairs alone to get her cell phone and came back down saying ""I'm never going in your room alone ever again..."" I asked her why and she described the feeling that I had been getting in my room. I told my mother about it and she didn't believe me.

A few months later my brother came to my house and he brought his dog with him, she wouldn't enter my room, and when they forced her into my room she was scared half to death, my parents and my brother were there and they have no clue why it happened.

So is it just a coincidence that the dog and my friend felt something in the room along with me or is it someone or something left in the house? What do you think?

My Haunting Hates Hard Rock!,"New York, United States",Poltergeists / Physical Manifestations,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Poltergeists / Physical Manifestations :: My Haunting Hates Hard Rock!

S ome years ago, when I was sixteen, I had the one of the most frightening experiences of my life. I was in my bedroom writing some rather hard rocking music on my new synthesizer, when my mother came in and said that dad and her were going to the grocery store. Basically I just nodded with that teenage temperament that speaks, ""yeah, ok, whatever, bye"". Soon after their departure it began to cloud up outside as if a rainstorm was imminent.

My bedroom window was open and speaking of this particular window; it was a very old window that took just about all of the strength one could muster up to open it and to close it - well, let's just say that seemed about twice as hard to accomplish that feat - so basically the window, for all intents and purposes, was stuck open; come rain or shine.

As I slowly crept the volume up on my amplifier and played more and more feverishly to the rocking tune I was creating, the attic door, a standard 1930's issue inside door, which is also in my room suddenly swung open. Startled, I quickly hit the Stop button on my synth and turned around to see the attic door fully open. My rather logical mind, though stunned, quickly jumped in and said, ""The window is open and it was probably just a pressure draft that pulled the door open"". So with that logical explanation firmly in place, I pressed the start button and continued to marvel at my loud, musical creation.

Not more than ten seconds passed and I heard the attic door slam shut; rather loudly! This time I noticed, there was absolutely no breeze coming in the window. In fact, the curtains weren't rustling at all. ""Hmm... That was weird and scared the heck out of me"", I mumbled to myself. But once again, even though the hair on my arms was standing at full attention, my logic interrupted and put me at ease.

After taking a deep breath, I decided to again press start and wait and see what happens. Nothing. Then, just as I was getting into the music again, the attic door slammed open with such ferocity that it made the room shake then it immediately slammed shut again. This time, not only was every hair on my body standing straight up, but I was frozen in place with an intense fear - as if a presence was in the room with me - and it was standing right behind me, breathing down my neck.

I felt compelled to run as fast as I could from the room, but instead I began walking toward the open window. I was no more than three steps away from the window when it suddenly slammed shut and the glass broke inward into my room.

In one quick motion I leaped toward my bedroom door, yanked the door open and flew down the stairs, missing about fifteen of sixteen steps; pulled open the front door of the house and ran into the front yard. I stood in the front yard for the next twenty minutes (until my parents returned) in the drizzling rain, staring up into my bedroom window in complete shock over what had just transpired.

As I recall, this was the only ""hostile"" event that ever happened while in my house. While many will agree this seems like an extreme paranormal experience, some offered a more subtle, logical explanation to this event.

I was told that my first impulse, in which air pressure was causing the door to open and shut, was the correct unconscious response to what was happening. That the window in my room was wide open just before a thunderstorm completely explains this strange but all too common phenomenon. The fact that my window slammed shut just as I was walking towards it was nothing more than the coincidence of the loud rocking music causing vibrations in the window frame, thus freeing the old window from its ""stuck"" state, ultimately leading to it slamming shut.

A teenager all alone in an old house as storm clouds approached produced an unconscious fear response that so many youngsters experience when startled.

These explanations in and by themselves are actually very academic and the most logical explanations available, but once this story is put into context with the other strange occurrences that happened while in the house lead me to less logical conclusions.

As such, my conclusions lead me to abandon the overpowering musical work I had been composing and indulge in more benign and relaxed music fare. So that evening I erased the composition and began working on my first love ballad, which as it turns out was the first real song I ever wrote. Oddly enough, and I know this will sound cliche, but soon after turning my musical taste to the more relaxed state, a soft smell of roses filled my room. At the time I had no idea where such a smell was coming from but it was there. I carefully walked over to the attic door with every corpuscle on my body in full alert; most likely from the earlier trauma I suffered; and slowly opened the door. To my amazement the smell of roses was ten-fold stronger in the attic stairway!

All at once my fear dissipated and I was filled with newly found inspiration to complete my first, and to this day, one of my best musical compositions.

Dormitory Ghost Story,"Florida, United States",Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: Dormitory Ghost Story

I n 1980, I was attending Chipola Junior College in Marianna, Florida. I was living in the dorm and I worked at the reception desk every weekend. Often times I was the only person there for the entire weekend. On this particular weekend, Sunday afternoon rolled around and my roommate and suitemates returned from their homes (the way the rooms were laid out, there were two rooms with a bathroom between them - together they were considered a ""suite""). I was helping them unload their cars - they always brought back awesome groceries from home - and passed through bathroom to put some of my roommates things in our room.

As I walked back through the bathroom (I decided to walk back through my suitemates room instead of walking out into the dorm hall) I looked to my right. This area was pretty small as it was the entrance/exit for the shower. As I looked to my right I saw a young woman there. She was medium height, with long dark straight hair. Her hair was parted in the middle and she was wearing a blue and red rugby style shirt - her hair and shirt style reminded me of the fashions of the early 70s. Of course, I knew immediately she didn't belong there and quickly looked away and then back. She was gone.

I was really excited and ran to find my suitemates and roommate who were walking down the hall. I told them the story of what I had just seen. I thought they'd think I was crazy, but they didn't. We decided that the next day we would find the cleaning lady and ask her if there had been a girl who had lived in one of our rooms and had died. Mrs. Rhyne (the cleaning lady) had been working in our dorm for a long time, so we knew she would know.

The next day we went on to classes and our other usual activities. In the afternoon my roommate and I were back in the dorm around 3:00 p.m. We eagerly sought out Mrs. Rhyne. She was in the laundry room working. I asked her if there had ever been a girl who had lived in our room who had died. She said she wasn't sure. I described the girl I had seen and Mrs. Rhyne told me she remembered a young girl fitting that description who had died in a car wreck.

Well, a few weeks passed and I'd decided I had just imagined the girl. But another weekend came around and I found I hadn't imagined it at all! It was Saturday night and I had been out with my cousin and a friend. Our curfew was 2 a.m., but I was home by midnight and safely in bed. About 1 a.m., I heard the water in the sink in the bathroom turn on. My suitemate was supposed to be coming into town for a date with her boyfriend. I assumed when I heard the water, that she had come in from her date. The water stayed on for a long time. I got really aggravated at my suitemate, but finally decided to get up and turn the water off.

The next morning, I went into my suitemates room, but she wasn't there. I thought maybe she and her boyfriend had gone out for breakfast. When she came in that evening, I asked her why she had left the water on the night before. She looked at me like I had lost my mind and asked me what I was talking about. I told her, ""You know, when you came in from your date last night - you turned on the water and left it on!"" She said, ""I never even came into to town last night. I was at my parents house all weekend...""

I decided my dark-haired friend wanted to make sure I knew she was there!

I never saw her again or had anymore evidence of her existence, but I know she is real!

A Guy in my Basement,"Maryland, United States",Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: A Guy in my Basement

I don't remember how old I was exactly when I first felt ""not alone"" in the basement of my parents' house. I was probably in the 10-11 age range when I would get the feeling of not being alone. Everyday I would come home from school and watch Nickelodeon on our basic cable TV in the basement. The house was built in the mid 80's, so it wasn't old/victorian/or even creepy at all. It was just... You know, a house. I would generally watch TV and play with my legos or draw in my sketch book or something to keep myself occupied.

Eventually though, I started getting the feeling sometimes that I was not alone down in the basement, and sometimes I would even see something out of my peripheral vision going down the hall to my right.

I would like to point out that I wasn't watching anything on TV that would weird me out and make my mind play tricks on me. I was usually watching Doug, or Darkwing Duck, or some other ridiculously awesome program when I would just see something jet through the hallway. I'd turn my head (of course) but nothing was there. Honestly, I wasn't really all THAT weirded out by it because I had quite the imagination, so I just blamed it on that. Not to say I didn't believe in ghosts - my favorite movie in the world was (and still is) Ghostbusters, and I've always loved the occult because of it.

This is where the story finally got me. One day I was in the upstairs bathroom brushing my teeth or sneaking a delicious Flintstone vitamin or something when I felt a hand touch my shoulder. I looked up into the mirror (because I was facing that direction) and saw a figure behind me... Looked like a guy, but I wasn't checking for chest hair, so I could be wrong. Naturally, I fled from the scene uttering obscenities at the world as I burst out the front door and into the road outside. I don't remember how long I stayed outside before I finally went spelunking back into my home, but I would venture a guess that it was a while.

On another note, my mother (who is REALLY into ghost stories / hauntings) claimed that she was home one day while I was at school and heard the door open and close downstairs. She assumed I was home early from school and yelled my name down over the banister towards the bottom of the stairs. No one answered... Especially not me because I was at school. Mom then called my sister's name... again, no answer. At this point, she went downstairs to investigate and found nothing. No matter what happened there, Mom believes that a ghost was up to shenanigans in our house.

Because we're adventurous, and mildly stupid, Mom and I decided to take the ghost thing kind of seriously and looked into the housing development's history. We found 2 things:

2. The development was built over old farm land, and as it turns out, about 2 courts away there used to be a cemetery for the farmer's family. Our neighbors/friends lived in that court and also claimed they'd hear the basement rocking chair in their home make noises in the night.

Well, that's all I got. It's all true and it happened back when I was a kid (I'm 26 now). It wasn't evil or anything... Just an experience or two.

Holding Me Down,United Kingdom,Old Hags / Night Attacks / Sleep Paralysis,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Old Hags / Night Attacks / Sleep Paralysis :: Holding Me Down

I 've always believed in ghosts and although I have always had a strong belief about them since the tender age of about 3, I never thought that I would ever encounter ghosts in my lifetime. Although in my house in Kennington (London), as a child I had experienced ghostly encounters where I would leave the living room and the whole house would suddenly be freezing cold and only the living room warm and especially in the kitchen while every one is asleep, I being a light sleeper, would hear things walking around and dropping things and I knew it wasn't my family as they all could sleep through a hurricane!

At around the age of 11 we moved up into the outer skirts of london (essex) and got a pretty big house for a good price. Everything was normal until about a year ago when I started experiencing being held down and not being able to move or breathe and this would always happen in the middle of a nightmare mostly of which something or someone was after me and I was seeing visions of something very terrible happening in the house.

I would open my eyes and it would be pitch black except for the tv and terrified, I would try getting up to stay with my mum and dad in their room until I'd realize that I couldn't move and this only used to happen like twice a month until it started happening more frequently days on end and I got scared of going to sleep.

My most recent encounter was this morning, I was awake and waking up from a pretty bad dream and tried getting up but I was laying there unable to breathe or move. Thank God for my mother, who when I told her about my encounters taught me to try moving my toes and fingers, because with the encounters I also would be unable to speak or shout out for help and I noticed too that even after my mother had taught me to move my toes and fingers it worked for some time then stopped working.

Sometimes after waking up in the middle of the night after the encounter and being able to breathe and move again I would make to sleep again and instantly slip into some sort of hypnotic state of which I'm not asleep and then I won't be able to move again... It still happens and it stopped for about 2-3 months and this morning it happened again I don't know what to do but if any one has any suggestions to help then it would be much appreciated!

Leave Me Alone Rosa,"Illinois, United States",Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: Leave Me Alone Rosa

T his happened to one of my friends. She has told me many stories about spirits roaming her house but this one sounded very interesting for me. One night she told me that she was by herself in the apartment and was using the computer. Later that night she got tired and went to bed. And turned off the lights. She had this weird feeling that there was a presence in her room and got scared because she didn't know if it was evil or not. She went under her covers and stayed there. She heard someone in the kitchen (her room is right next to the kitchen) and she knew it wasn't her parents because they were out. She knew it was something else. She heard it walking and it stopped. The spirit was in her room. She could feel it. But was it evil?

She was still under her covers but for some reason she remembered what I had told her. I said, ""I know this is easy to say but hard to do, but you have to be brave when something happens like that. Don't let it scare you. You're the boss. Tell it that you want it to leave. Sometimes they don't know if they're scaring you. You're the boss. Face them. It's the right thing to do and I know it would be hard to do if I was in the same situation but I'll still try...""

So she told her herself, Ima do this. I can do this. She took the cover off her face and noticed that her room was empty. Nobody was there except for her. But she can still feel the presence. She said, ""If somebody's here move the plastic bag that is right next to me..."" But it didn't and she knew that the spirit was right there. She talked to it but it never responded.

She got really scared and went to her parent's room. The next morning she told her mom that something was in there and didn't leave her alone. So they did some investigation and went downstairs and told the owners of the house if somebody passed away upstairs. They said yeah. Her name was Rosa. She didn't speak any English. Only Spanish. This is the reason why Rosa didn't cooperate with my friend because she didn't understand what my friend was saying.

So at night my friend went to sleep but woke up suddenly knowing that Rosa was in her room. She finally told her in spanish, ""If you are Rosa, move that plastic bag..."" She obeyed her and moved it. My friend got really scared because it was her first time to see a spirit obeying her and moving things. She said, ""why are you here? You passed away now. Please leave me alone because you are scaring me. You don't belong here...""

The next morning my friend's room was blessed and Rosa never bothered them ever again.

"Curse of ""Shauneta""","California, United States",Misc,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Misc :: Curse of ""Shauneta""

W orking until ten at night I often wasn't home until eleven. On one particular night, I had been shopping after work and found a glass cutting board with a beautifully painted rooster on it. Just my neighbor Patty's style! I wanted her to be surprised in the morning and find it on her porch. We lived in Orangevale California it is a country town outside of Sacramento. There were no porch lights between my home and hers, the thing I feared walking to her place was some drunk or spraining my ankle in a pot hole.

The country was safer than most parts of the city, it was more beautiful too, there were hawks, a few coyotes and huge oaks that were hundreds of years old, and this had occasionally led me to wonder what this land was like when it belonged to the Native Americans, before the Spanish and the US arrived. That night fearing an addict, I let my baby-dog out to walk with me. Her name was Jelly Bean and she was a protective German Shepard, a good companion and protector. About 10 feet from the porch I heard a man say ""shauneta"" over my left shoulder. He sounded like a mere yard from me, my adrenaline had started pumping and I was getting goose bumps. My dog was sniffing some flowers and seemed to be ignoring the situation.

I slowly turned to meet this person, my lungs filling with air ready to scream and wake everyone if I had to. No one was there! My dog was still enjoying the garden. I am a logical person and I tried to figure out where the voice had came from, it was a voice that had no organic source, but had a crystal clear tone. I had no idea what this word meant, do you? Deep in my bones I felt like I had just intruded on someone and this person was upset at me. I quickly ran to the porch tossed my gift there and called to Jelly Bean and we ran back home.

I shut the door and every window to keep the night breezes out. I knew it was a ghost. My dog came over to me and I petted her for a long, long time. The next morning I left early to school and researched what that word meant, I just couldn't find any definition. That is when everything I loved began to get destroyed off piece by piece, but all within three months of that night.

First, I was made to leave my well paying job. Second, my beloved, and up to that point healthy, dog got very sick. The vet said nothing could be done for her. Three weeks later she died of a stomach tumor. Third my cars transmission blew up. School was thirty miles away and I had to drop out. Lastly, my beloved favorite aunt Honey-Jo called me, saying the doctors gave her only two weeks to live. She was a fit and healthy non smoking 74 year old woman. She had lung cancer. Honey-Jo in many ways had been closer to me than my parents. I went to visit her and she passed on.

All of these things happening concurrently were excruciating. This is more than coincidence, this strange voice and then terrible occurrences. Was the voice a Native-American victim of a long ago genocide taking revenge? I guess I don't need to ask that I feel the answer is yes. If you know what ""shauneta"" means please let me know, this is a mystery so important to me!

Lights Turning On,United Kingdom,Poltergeists / Physical Manifestations,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Poltergeists / Physical Manifestations :: Lights Turning On

T his story that I am about to tell happened only last night. It seems everything strange happened yesterday and this morning... But moving on, It started like this. Ss usual I always go to bed the latest and feeling a little peckish after watching a bit of Jerry Springer, I made my way downstairs into the kitchen to find something to eat.

The rest of the family were sound asleep so I tried to do everything with as little sound as possible. As I was approaching the stairs I heard the light in the bathroom upstairs go on. But there was nobody there and the bathroom is directly in front of the landing once you get up the stairs and I was already approaching the bottom stairs. So I sprinted up the stairs already shaken to go and see who it was. But no one was there and I know I would have seen the person because they wouldn't have had enough time to get into any of the rooms!

So I just switched off the light and brushed it aside thinking it was my imagination running wild. Then I went into my room and closed the door to get down to ma snack. As the program that I was watching went on a break, I muted the sound (a habit of mine) and finished my snack. Then I heard the door open a crack and I could see only pitch black because all the lights were off (except my bedroom) and heard as if someone was walking up and down so I jumped and grabbed the door open hoping to scare whoever was trying to scare me but only ended up getting the scare when I realized no one was there!

I could hear my dad snoring and my mum snoring and my little sisters in their room snoring soundly too, so I began wandering... So quietly I switched off the light in my room and went into the bathroom and waited in anticipation while all the lights were off. Then without warning the light in my room went on and no one had gone into the room. That's when I practically freaked out! I didn't sleep in my room that night! I went into my little sister's room and laid some sheets on the floor and went to sleep!

Invitation,"Massachusetts, United States",Ouija Board / Seances,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Ouija Board / Seances :: Invitation

W hen I was younger, I lived in another country. I moved to the United States to live with my dad when I was five. My sister and I were instantly pulled into the world of the supernatural and certainly were what you would call obsessed. When I look back on it now I can trace our obsession to the constant drool of ghost stories coming out of my uncle's mouth at that time. Our grandpa was also very intent on scaring us to death. Naturally we honored what they told us.

After a while we tired of ghost stories and convinced ourselves that there was a presence in our rented apartment. Of course there was nothing there... At the time. We grew obsessed with trying to talk this ""spirit"" and tried all forms of communication with this thing. We set up sticky notes with questions about the ghost. We even attempted a seance at one time or another. We used our mom's tape recorder to try and capture any sounds in our room. Nothing came out of these tests.

After a while we got tired of ghost hunting and, as children, focused on various other things. During the last few months that I lived in the apartment (my parents bought a house and so we were moving) strange things started happening. I can't quite place what was happening but during those months I slept less, ate less and experienced nightmares like I never imagined.

My parents have attributed this to the anxiety of leaving a place you have lived in for so long, but somehow I doubt it. I felt something in that house and of course it was like nothing I had felt before. My cat acted strange also, so I know that it was something slightly more worrisome than moving anxiety.

I left something there... All my years of poking into whatever other world I believed there was. I left it in that house and maybe... Just maybe part of it followed me... This is a true story, not something I made up.

Rustling Noises,United Kingdom,Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: Rustling Noises

I was in the kitchen at around 11:00PM making some toast (I was feeling peckish) and I was already feeling shaken as being a very superstitious person, I hated being alone in the night especially when everyone appears to be asleep! So as I was waiting by the toaster waiting for the toast to pop up I heard a rustling under the dining table (my kitchen has an open area which leads into the dining room which then leads into the living room and so on...) and I thought...  what is that! And I knew we didn't have mice! So after I was frozen in fright, the toast popped up and it frightened the living daylights out of me, so I grabbed the toast and calmed myself down.

Then I heard a sound like someone speaking and I was more than prepared to assume that it was our next door neighbors but they were asleep and it sounded like it was coming from the living room, so I crept into the living room and saw nothing. Then I went back into the kitchen and continued my toast ritual and then I heard the voice speaking but in a mocking sort of voice, like it was making fun of me, then the rustling under the table began again and I was terrified by this time so I looked around and under the table seeing nothing and no one.

The lights in the kitchen started dimming and then it went off, totally leaving me in pitch darkness and I could feel the whole room go eerily freezing cold and I felt almost lifeless. I ran with all I had into my room and huddled under the quilt, then with almighty force the quilt came off me and I ran in tears now into my parents room and huddled with them and told them what happened!

I have never been able to sleep alone without being afraid anymore! Strange occurrences still occur I wonder what it could be... Also note that this was about a year ago.

Strange Lights,"Ohio, United States",Orbs / Lights / Mists,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Orbs / Lights / Mists :: Strange Lights

A re the Haunting flashes of light from a vacant apartment, wanting my attention? I'm looking for help with an experience I had this last Saturday night, July 21, 2007. I live in northeast Ohio and I have been searching the Internet for similar experiences when I stumbled on to this site. Thank you for this venue. My experience deals with flashes of a dim bluish light, similar to what a plasma (static) lightning ball would produce and flashes of a yellow; or at times, white light of varying brightness, shape and position or location in the room. I was observing this from 11:30pm till around 3am coming from a vacant apartment that sits facing mine, not more than 50 feet from my patio door. I have clear vision from here through the patio door and into the living room of this apartment, plus the two bedrooms through their windows. It's vacant, so there aren't any blinds or curtains.

It's been vacant for around two weeks now and this was the only time I had seen anything like this happen over there, or anywhere before. From what I seen and experienced that night has me terrified to look in that direction now. I don't think that I ever want to see something like that again.

I'm in a wheelchair and often sit; with my sliding glass door open, right there looking out over my patio and here lately, devising a way to catch a mole that's reeking havoc with my flowers. Yep, he runs around late at night just as he does during the day. I hate that mole. This last Saturday with the time a little after 11:30pm, I noticed a yellow light about the size of a beach ball, located just inside the patio door and off to the right corner of this vacant apartment. It only lasted about two seconds or so. How strange is that; I thought, the apartment is totally empty and there's nothing there to produce that light.

So I started watching the place, I thought someone must have broken into the apartment and had a flashlight. But that didn't fit because this light had form to it and seemed to appear spherical. Less than a minute later, in the back bedroom of this apartment, I notice a dim bluish light that appeared for a few seconds, low and just off of the floor, around or just outside the bedroom door, in the hallway and you could see a portion of it through the bedroom window. This was a bluish light and couldn't have come from any flashlight, I thought.

Just then was a flash of a bright yellowish light out in the living room next to where the intercom and buzzer for the building's front door was. It was a narrow vertical flash about three or four feet in length and a few feet off the floor. Immediately after that was a flash of a dimmer light a foot or two to the right of the last one. It was small and appeared round but was too fast to get a good look at. At this point all I was thinking was, what the hell.

I shut my patio door and went to sit in my recliner to think about what I just seen. Should I call the cops and have them come out to check the apartment? Just what would I say to them, about the lights and just how crazy are they going to think I am? I thought about having the maintenance man for the complex paged to look things over. Maybe there was something wrong with the electrical fuse box in the apartment causing electrical arcing and throwing sparks. I tried thinking of any reasonable explanation for what I seen and nothing worked.

So I didn't call anyone and decided to have another look. Back in my wheelchair, I opened the patio door. Sitting there, I wondered if there'd be any more lights and just that fast, there was a flash in the living room. Over the next ten to fifteen minutes, there were a total of about six flashes that appeared in that room, each would only last a second or two and vary in size, brightness and location. The whole time I tried coming up with an explanation. The only thought I was left with, was once again, what the hell. I shut the door and returned to my recliner to watch some TV.

I considered everything, I even questioned if this was all my imagination. After about twenty minutes of this, I was left with only two possible explanations. One being that there was someone hiding in the hallway of this apartment with a flash or strobe light and a ""bag of tricks"" to reflect the light around the living room or the place was haunted. Neither reasonable. I wanted to watch some more, but it was a bit chilly out this night for being July, it was around 58 degrees and the shorts I was wearing weren't cutting it.

So I changed into some jeans and returned for what was way more interesting than what was on TV.  Sitting there, the lights continued to flash every minute or two and I was trying to figure out how someone hiding in the hallway could be doing this. It seemed the most plausible explanation considering the other. Then a flash of bluish light coming from the bedroom door/hallway; as in the first series, caught my attention. I was thinking this guy had to have not only a strobe or flash unit but also a plasma globe of some sorts to produce that soft bluish light. I'm now thinking, OK this theory just isn't plausible, it's got to be ""M"" haunting the place. Just then was the brightest flash of light coming from the living room, a chill ran down my spine and through my body and my neighbors could probably have heard me say right then, ""What..."" Well, you probably know what I said.

That bright flash of light was the one located over by the intercom/buzzer and was a vertical shape. It will be this one, that becomes the most active along with the smaller flash that appears just to the right of it. The bluish light that seemed to come from the hallway, just outside the bedroom door became more active, but by the time you noticed the light back there, it would be gone. A quick flash or perhaps it would run out of sight up the hall. When it would appear, there wouldn't be any other flashes of light out in the living room area.

During the 40, 45 or 50 minutes that I sat there in total amazement of all this, there might only be a minute or two in-between flashes or a series of lights. It was during these breaks that I seriously started considering that this could be ""M"" haunting the apartment. It almost seemed to me that each time I was thinking of ""M"" doing this, that the next flash of light would be the vertical shape by the intercom followed by the smaller one to it's side, the ""intercom lights.""

At this time, I'm starting to be concerned that not only this was ""M"" and that she was wanting my attention, but she might be responding to my thoughts. I haven't had the time to realize how frightening a concept that was at the time. So I wanted to put it to the test. I started thinking over and over again, ""if this is 'M' causing these lights and you can hear my thoughts, show me by lighting up the whole room with one big flash of light. All I've seen tonight were isolated flashes one place or another. If you hear me, can you light up the whole room?""

I just kept running these thoughts through my mind for the next three or four minutes and then waited. The intercom lights slowly flashed once each a dim yellow light and that was it. OK, well, I don't know what that might have meant, but I thought she might be too tired or not have enough energy to do what I was asking. But what do I know, this is all nothing but a wild guess. I came back in and shut the sliding glass door and blinds to retreat to my recliner.

As all guys sitting in a recliner late at night watching TV, I dosed off at some point. I have no idea how long but I woke up a few minutes before 3am and decided that it was time for bed. I gathered up my cell phone and whatever else I needed to take with me and got in my wheelchair. But I just had to take one more look at the vacant apartment across the lawn. I figured that if someone had been in there messing around that they would be long gone by this time and I didn't see any red flashing lights from fire engines so the place didn't burn down from some electrical arcing or sparks from something.

I opened the blinds and door and sat there for a few minutes and then sort of jokingly asked if ""M"" was still around. A few seconds go by and the intercom lights dimly flashed once each. Well, that's really something, I thought. I was really tired and that's all the thought I could muster at the time other than I need to go in to bed now and get some sleep. Just then there was a flash of light coming from the kitchen or hallway of this apartment that lit up the whole living room area for a fraction of a second. I was just floored. Was this the answer I was looking for? I couldn't do anything but close the door, lock it and go to bed where I didn't sleep one bit.

Nothing happened Sunday night and I began to question my whole experience the night before. I called the rental office here on Monday and reported seeing some lights flashing and perhaps something sparking or electrical arcing happening in the apartment Saturday night and suggested that someone might have been in there. The property manager and the maintenance guy went to check the place that afternoon and after seeing me on my patio, they walked over to tell me they didn't find anything wrong. (While they were in there, they closed the vertical blinds for the patio door.)

We started talking and I was being a little more specific with what I had seen with the blue light back by the bedroom door and different flashes out in the living room. I come to find out that the Mother and young son that was living there for the last 7 months or so, before suddenly moving out two weeks back, complained to the maintenance guy about a blue light that stayed close to the floor in the hallway that would have a crackling noise and then other yellow lights that would flash around the kitchen and living room.

She complained about this a few times to him but he never found anything wrong in the apartment. He went on to say, how she said that her and her son would have to sit together out on the sofa the whole night with all the lights on because she was afraid of what might happen.

So now I'm thinking back to when they lived there. Even though they had blinds on the windows, you could see that they always left the televisions on all night long in each of the bedrooms. Then there were those nights when every light in the apartment stayed on all night as well. She worked and both would get up, leave early and then return around five or so. The boy was never allowed out to play with the other kids, they always kept to themselves and didn't talk to anyone.

As the three of us talked that Monday, it became somewhat obvious to the property manager that with the two independent accounts of this activity and the story of ""M"" we told him, that the place might just be haunted. The manager was somewhat new to the property. The maintenance guy doesn't believe in that stuff, even though as the property manager pointed out to him that there were now these two independent sources reporting the same activity. The manager ask me to keep my eyes open and wouldn't it be great if you could record it next time. I told him that they'd have to open the blinds back up for the patio door and I'd see what happens. I was told they'd open the blinds the next day.

It all was painfully obvious to me what was going on here. Well, it was one of two things. Either the maintenance guy was lying about what the woman had told him and he was the one in that apartment that night with the lights and ""bag of tricks."" Or it really was ""M"" haunting the place. I guess that I should tell you about ""M"" now. She was living in that apartment this time last year and was a resident for several years prior. I knew her, we weren't what you would call close friends, but we would sit on the patio and talk once in a while and always waved hello.

Sometime in August of last year she fell from a ladder or down some steps and broke her ankle. Two days after that she collapsed in the hallway of her apartment and died there. Her body wasn't discovered for six days after that. She was no more than 42 years old at the time and she died of a blood clot or internal bleeding resulting from the fall from what we heard.

The blinds weren't opened up in that apartment until Thursday afternoon. As I finish typing this, it's Saturday afternoon, one week later. To be honest, I haven't looked towards that apartment all week. I'm afraid it's her and she's trying to get my attention. I think she's confused about what happened and hasn't moved on to where ever one needs to go when you die. The thing that's most disturbing to me is that she might hear my thoughts. I'm totally freaked about that possibility. I'm not looking forward to seeing it again but I need to find out what the hell is going on.

[note from the webmaster: the following has been added by the author on 2007-08-04]

I watched the vacant apartment with my video camera for five nights, but the flashing lights never reoccurred. The night before the apartment was to be reoccupied, I went over to the patio door of the apartment with my camera and took some pictures of the location that I had seen the lights in my story. I didn't see anything while I was there doing this, but something appears in the photos. There's some serious glare from the flash reflecting off the glass door, but you can still see these things.

As I sat in front of the patio door I took a photo of the inside wall to the right. In my story, I refer to what I called the ""Intercom Lights"" as being the most active. This photo is of that area. You can see the door to the apartment and the intercom to the right of that. In the photo, I noticed three swirls of light by the intercom. When I zoomed in on these swirls, you can see a group of three lights swirling around in one bunch and another individual swirl of light above the group and yet another individual swirl to the right of the group. What is this?

(Second set of two, Kitchen - hallway, Kitchen - hallway enlarged)

The next photo was to the left side of the living room area. In my story, I referred to a single flash of light that illuminated the whole living room that seemed to come from the kitchen/hallway area. This photo is of that area. Remember M died in the hallway. Again you have to ignore the glare from the flash and the reflection of some windows from another building in the glass. But if you look just above where the reflection of the windows, there's something else in the room. I took and enlarged this one too.

Nothing as spectacular as the ghost pictures you have on here. But what is this?

Daughter's Dream Ghost,Australia,Children Who See Spirits,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Children Who See Spirits :: Daughter's Dream Ghost

W e live in a house that is about a hundred and twenty years old. Over the years the house has been extended and altered. My daughter has the oldest bedroom in the house. For several weeks my daughter has had a ghostly dream almost every night.

She dreams of a girl in an old fashioned blue dress trimmed with white lace. On several occasions the girl has tried to strangle our daughter. We suggested she hang a crucifix in her room and the dreams stopped. However when the crucifix was removed the dream girl/ghost returned. She told our daughter she was angry because she had tried to ward her away. Our daughter did not know what the word ward meant until we told her. At this stage our daughter moved to different room.

The ghost dream has followed her, but has been more friendly. She has explained that she is eleven years old and that she is trapped in the house because she can't find her brother. She said she didn't mean to harm her when she strangled her but she had done that to her brother playing. She told our daughter that her old room had been her room. Our daughter told her to follow the light but she said she can't find any. We have arranged for a medium to come to the house in a few days to see if she can help.

In addition to this we have an elderly ghost. Many people have heard the distinctive sound of an elderly person wearing slippers and walking with the aid of a heavy walking frame. This starts at the original front door, which is no longer the front door and ends at the end of the corridor. Our cat refuses to walk at the spot where the footsteps stop, always jumping over this space.

Saying Goodbye,Canada,Family / Friends Visits,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Family / Friends Visits :: Saying Goodbye

T his is a true story about a man named Dick. I had been dating Dick's son for about three or four month's, when Dick passed away. He was an elderly man and had lot's of health problems, my boyfriend was very close to his family. We went to his parents house two maybe three times a week, dinners, outings, parties. He had a big family and I was happy to be a part of it.

Dick was very happy that there was talk about me becoming part of the family, every time he saw me he would kiss my hand, with a big smile on his face. We were all out for breakfast one morning when the call came in, Dick had collapsed and was taken to hospital and put on life support, by the end of the day Dick was taken off life support and was surrounded by his family.

It seemed to me that it was a peaceful passing. On the last night of the funeral, my boyfriend and I went back to his apartment, I fell asleep on one couch, he on the other, I still to this day don't know why I woke up but I did, and there was Dick standing over his son. I sat up and said ""Hi Dick"" and reached out my hand for him to kiss it. As I reached out I realized this is not right, I said ""Dick your not supposed to be here"", he looked at me and smiled then turned back to his son, he stood there for a few minutes then turned and walked down the hall were the children were sleeping.

I think Dick had a very busy night saying goodbye to everyone.

My First Ghost Hunting,"Oregon, United States",Ghost Hunting,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Ghost Hunting :: My First Ghost Hunting

A fter watching 3 hours of TAPS my friend and I decided to go on a ghost hunt. Me with a building curiosity of the supernatural and yet no experiences, I was hoping for something. We decided on a local cemetery rumored to be haunted and left for our trip. The cemetery was located passed a gravel road hidden in a small patch of woods. We arrived at the cemetery and followed the path that circled the cemetery.

Initially we were a little spooked that this final resting place was secluded in small patch of woods. After 30 minutes, a third friend showed up and decided to participate. He told us that a friend had seen a large bright orb, the ghost of a small girl, heard sounds and whispers, and upon leaving found small hand prints on the trunk of the car.

Our first unexplainable occurrence, we heard a sound, it resembled that of static from a radio, it occurred twice but sounded to be moving away.

A truck drove by, the locals were home. Worried of a drunk coming at us we decided to stick around a little longer. We heard more noises as if someone was walking around, we were disappointed when we found it was another friend attempting to scare us, we decided to leave.

I know my story is not much, but I feel a strong urge day to day, to see or hear something of the supernatural, and I will continue to hunt the supernatural. We will be taking all of our next investigations seriously. Once again sorry if this story in uninteresting.

Next week we will be going to another cemetery rumored to be very haunted, This time we will bring recording equipment.

Visitors at Night,"New Jersey, United States",Psychic / Medium,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Psychic / Medium :: Visitors at Night

I appreciate being able to share the following experiences (the most recent from last night), which have puzzled me since childhood. The scene usually unfolds in the following way: Sometime during the night I wake up to see a figure standing at the side of my bed. Rather than being a shadowy, indistinct figure, as described in other posts on this site, the figures appear as quite distinct, with memorable features.

For instance, one time I awoke to see a teenaged girl, with a round face and dark, wavy, shoulder-length hair, standing on the opposite side of the bed staring at me. She raised her hand slowly and I noticed that she was holding a lit cigarette. To my horror, she put the lit tip of the cigarette to her neck to burn herself. I jumped up from pure fright and she was gone.

Another time I awoke to see a small blonde-haired girl standing at the opposite side of the bed. She grabbed the bedcovers and pulled them back as though she intended to climb into the bed. I jumped up and she was gone. Another time I woke up and saw a teenaged boy standing in the room. There was nothing remarkable about him except his distinctly red, wavy hair. Another time I woke to see an older gentleman with longish gray hair, wearing a nightshirt and holding a candle in a candleholder.

There have been a few occasions when I have awakened to see cloaked figures by the bedside (only one at a time, not in a group). The figures typically have dark robes, although one time I saw a figure in a white robe. I find these figures more frightening, because in these instances, I cannot clearly see facial features.

There have been two times when I have woken up to see a figure with a very short stature - one time crouched on the corner of my bed and dressed in black, and another time standing at the bedside wearing a strange sort of outfit that included a hat.

I have to admit that I am not brave enough to try and communicate with these figures, as others have done who've posted their experiences on this site. In fact, I am terrified of them - so much so that I have jumped out of bed and run clear out of the room and down the hall in a panic.

Another thing I do (which is what I did last night when I woke to see the figure of a man standing on the opposite side of the bed) is grab my pillow and start swinging at the figure. I know it sounds ridiculous, but it is an automatic response. I woke this morning to find all the picture frames from the bedside table scattered onto the floor because of my defensive ""attack"" with the pillow during the night.

I want to clarify that these nighttime sightings and visits have happened since childhood and happen wherever I happen to be living. In other words, they don't appear to be ""place related"". In fact, my home does not feel haunted at all - it feels quite clear and peaceful. But my sleep is often disturbed by this host of characters who seem to appear with no discernable pattern.

I know a woman who analyzes dream symbols from a Jungian perspective. She theorizes that these figures are aspects of me that I am projecting and need to integrate. I don't want to close myself off to any possible explanation, even this one, but these beings feel very distinct from me and not at all like projections.

Has anyone experienced anything similar? It would be very helpful to know the details of your experience. Thank you.

Strange Presences at Night,Mexico,Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: Strange Presences at Night

S ince I moved to Tijuana, Mexico, I have been waking up at about 3:05 or 3:15 a.m. My room is on the 3rd floor of my house, I am the only one who sleeps there (my mom and brother have their rooms on the second floor). At first, I thought it was because I was not going to school and since I was not tired, I did not need to sleep as usual.

After I started working, I assumed everything would go back to normal but I was wrong. No matter how tired or sleepy I am, something keeps waking me up at 3 in the morning. My mom blamed it on Emily Rose's movie (since they say 3 a.m. is the witching hour) but my sudden awakenings started before the movie was even announced.

Suddenly, my eyes open and I feel someone is outside my room, I feel observed and scared. A few seconds later, I really need to turn the light and tv on because my mind starts making up images and theories as my heart pounds. When I try to fall asleep again, I hear a girl and a man whispering but I don't understand what they say. Still, it scares me not knowing what they want. Once, I heard as if someone had screamed right at my ear and I couldn't find an explanation for that when I woke up.

I have noticed the dogs going crazy when all of this happens and their bark gives me goosebumps, they sound really disturbed by something.

Does anyone have an idea of what may be possibly happening? I've heard stories about my neighborhood being built on what it used to be a graveyard but I am not quite convinced.

Young Face in Charleston,"South Carolina, United States",Ghost Tours & Haunted Hotels,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Ghost Tours & Haunted Hotels :: Young Face in Charleston

T his true event took place in Charleston, South Carolina. It happened to my six year old Jenna who is very honest and doesn't make up stories. Kara, my 12 year old daughter, was disappointed because the ghost tours were booked up and some didn't run on Sundays and Mondays. Well, on Monday (25 June 2007), we found a place that just opened up to see if we could find her a book on the ghosts of Charleston. This place, Charleston Legends, was only open for about a month.

There was a young lady tending the place and mentioned if we were interested, they had a show every hour that lasted 25 minutes on the ghosts of Charleston. Kara just had to see this so we did. Before we went in we stood there talking with this young lady. She said she and her husband have been interested in ghost for 16 years but I don't think she's ever seen one. For those who don't know, I've seen one ghost in the late 1970's but we won't go there right now. If you want to know more about my encounter let me know.

This lady said that one evening, she heard a noise in the back room. She knew no one else was there so went back that way. She reminded us that there was no air-conditioning ducts back there that could cause a noise or draft. She was looking back the hallway and saw the one door slowly open. She didn't think much of it and thought it was possibly the air-conditioning duct in the front room that caused it to somehow open. Then, the door began to close! Ha... She said she took off to the front room and forgot about what she had just seen. She said that the lady who places the paper towels out each night, in the bathroom, said that each morning when she comes in, the towels have moved. That makes you think. Since I witnessed a ghost I don't doubt either one of these ladies.

I'm still not to the point I really wanted to share with you. We went into the room to see the show. It was a very nice room fixed up and decorated like an old Charleston home. It had windows, curtains, a fireplace, rocking chair, old furniture, and old desk, lamps, etc. We sat on a bench in the center of the room. The show started. A young man behind a screen appeared as other people did and told their tales and then vanished into the room as a beam of light. Things in the room moved too. Little Jenna was so afraid that she covered up her head with her arms and would rarely sneak a peak.

My wife kept nudging me to show me how Jenna was covering up her eyes and wouldn't look. We sat through about 20 minutes of the show and then Jenna began to cry. My wife took her from the room as Kara and I stayed for the end of the show. When we got outside we asked Jenna what scared her so much. She said the little boy. We said what little boy? Where did you see a little boy? She said right above her head. Jenna took her hand and showed the little boy was only an arm's reach from her head. She said he kind of looked like a clown but wasn't a clown. He smiled like a clown but more of a scary smile than a happy smile. His face was covered with blood. Some smeared and some running. This was not seen by us and was not a part of the show. She said the little boy was about 7 years old with short brown hair. She couldn't see his body because he was leaning out over her, from behind, and his face was looking at her upside down in front of her. Actually between her and Kara she said. She said she saw the little boy for about 8 seconds and then covered up her eyes. When she looked up again the boy was gone. This is when she began to cry... 20 minutes into the show.

She said she felt like hitting him but was too frightened. We asked her if she thought that her mommy, daddy and sister could see the boy. She said she didn't think that. She actually didn't give it any thought. This was so weird! You know if a 6 year old is frightened of the show she would say she was frightened when the rocking chair moved, or the lamp moved, or when she heard a big noise or witnessed something that we saw too. She actually saw something so different and I believe her. I told her to remember what she saw and when we got home I wanted her to draw me a picture. She said ""Daddy, when something bad happens to me I never forget and will always remember it"". Wow! She did draw something that looks like a clown face with a big smile and covered with blood. I think she saw a ghost.

To those not believing in ghosts you'll doubt this. I was never one to believe in ghosts until I saw one... No doubt now! We spoke with Jenna, after leaving the store, we went back to tell the young lady. She said that she would pass it on to others that work there and also speak with someone that knows and studies a lot about the ghosts seen and reported in Charleston, to see if a young boy about 7 years old with a face covered in blood means anything. This may be a start of many sightings at this place.

Interesting isn't it? Jenna is not one to lie or tell stories. She was actually frightened by this young boy that we did not see.

Oldest Room in the House Haunted,"Pennsylvania, United States",Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: Oldest Room in the House Haunted

M y bedroom is the oldest room in my house. My house had many additions to it before we moved in. My room was the oldest so was probably more sensitive to paranormal experiences. My story all starts on the night of my cousin's party. I was getting ready for the party, the normal ritual, makeup, hair and jewelry. It was March and very cold outside. So I had my windows shut.

All of the sudden, my drapes started swinging and swinging and they clanged together, I was scared so I ran down stairs and left my door open stereo on and t.v and light on. I told my mom and she said the house is old it just was probably wind coming threw a crack in the wall. I wasn't about to believe it, I was sure it was a spirit. I said Ok and retreated upstairs to finish getting ready (still scared).

As I finished I went to go get my jacket, it was gone! I looked everywhere, until I got the guts to go to the attic, my jacket was hanging on the door knob. I picked it up but right when I touched the door knob, I felt a cold tingly sensation go down and up my body. I ran down the hallway down the steps and went and told my mom. As usual she did not believe me. I just got up and left still not knowing what was in my hallway room and attic, or if I was insane.

Nothing else happened until one night my friends and me were hanging out in my room, we heard thumping, then we got up and looked down the hall, everyone froze in disbelief, I stuttered ""Wa wa what's that!"" It was a black figure. We weren't sure if it was a robber or a ghost, so one of my friends got the courage and went to the middle of the hallway. And said ""Who are you and what do you want!"" It disappeared out of site, we were all sure it was a ghost.

But now that we are older we look back on it and always try and figure out who it was. We did some research, nothing showed up. That's my story, please comment and try to help me and my friends figure out who it was or what happened.

"Blood, Glass and Footsteps",United Kingdom,Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: Blood, Glass and Footsteps

I live with my two children, Amey aged 8 and Jamie aged 11. We've lived in our house for 7 years now, and there has been many ghostly encounters that we cannot explain. One night when my niece slept at our house, my niece and I was sat in the living room, while my two children were playing outside. We were talking when we were suddenly disrupted by loud footsteps running around upstairs across the bedrooms, when everyone was either outside or sat downstairs.

Three of us heard this running upstairs, which was obviously footsteps as we could hear them moving around, whatever it was that was making the noise was clearly running about.

The following week my mum came down to our house, and we were all sat near the kitchen, in the living room again, when suddenly the candle which was on the coffee table, flew across the room and shattered against the living room door. The candle was at the other side of the room. This really was unexplainable.

I have many decorative fairies which often gets thrown across the room by, who knows?

Sometimes late at night you can hear someone playing marbles across the bedroom floor, while the children are asleep.

Often, if we are using the mirror, there is someone behind us, but when we turn around it has disappeared.

Now this is really unexplainable, one night last week my son slept at his grandma's, and my daughter and I watched a movie. Before we went to bed we checked to see that all doors were locked and everything turned off, including lights and the television, and we went to bed. The next morning my daughter woke me up complaining of being hungry, so I let her go downstairs and get a biscuit.

She went downstairs, and then about five minutes later she returned upstairs with her biscuit, saying ""Mummy, mummy! There's a puddle of blood on the floor!""

I replied ""Oh, don't be silly, it'll be juice or something...""

She then said, ""No, it's not. It's on the living room floor!""

So I followed her downstairs and she pointed to what she saw. It was a puddle of blood from the kitchen door, with a very large bare footprint in the middle, with a trail leading to the rug. I couldn't believe my eyes! I was speechless, I didn't have a clue where it could have come from. The blood was still wet, it must have been fresh.

My little girl also talks to someone, but when I check to see who she's talking to, there's no one there. Could someone please help, as I would really like to know what's happening.

The Jacket,Uzbekistan,Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: The Jacket

O ne day I was sleeping at my cousin's house. Me and my cousin got really bored so we went and sat with her brother's girlfriend. We sat in her bedroom and she got a catalogue out, she started telling us what she wanted in her new house. When all of a sudden my cousin came out with ""do you know what, this house is haunted"", I said ""how would you know?"". Then all three of us heard a creak next to the door, then my jacket got lifted up of the bed and it flew across the room and when I sat up to go and get my jacket, we heard another creak next to the door. Then my cousin said ""that's how I know"".

It was really scary when it was all happening, it felt like I was just frozen, especially as it all happened right next to me. At first when I heard the creak, I thought it was just my auntie messing around. And that night none of us could get to sleep, we were that scared.

The next day when I told my mum and dad about it, they just laughed at me and said I was making it all up, but I know what I saw and I saw it with my own eyes. My brother and sister believed me, but they were just about the only people that did. I didn't really understand why it happened and what made it happen and still to this day I am really confused about it.

My Grandmother I've Never Met,"Louisiana, United States",Family / Friends Visits,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Family / Friends Visits :: My Grandmother I've Never Met

T his story happened when I was eight years old. I was laying in my bed with my mother. My room had no door because it used to be my grandma's room. My grandma died before I was born. So my mom was reading the newspaper and I was watching tv. I just happened to be looking into the dark hallway when I saw a very white figure pass by slowly. I was very scared. My mouth opened and my mom saw that I was very scared.

So my mom said ""Alyson, talk to me, what happened what did you see"" Then I said ""Mom was your mom tall?"" She said yes. Then I said ""Did she die in a white gown?"" She said ""yes"" So then I said I just saw your mom in the hallway. My mom started freaking out and went in my sister's room and she was sleeping. So was my brother. Then my mom told me how the house has been haunted but they never told me. I remember that story like it was yesterday.

I really wish I would of met my grandmother, she seemed to be a very nice person. I still wonder why she came to see me. My brother had the same experience when he was eight. He saw her in the hallway too. He is now 18. He can't believe what he saw. Why did she come see me and my brother but nobody else. It's weird.

Some people call us crazy but we now what we saw and it was not our imagination. I have actually had a lot more experiences in that same house with OTHER ghost, not sure who they are, but I saw them. We even had a ghost hunter who came to the house that said he was holding my grandmother's hand. He also described what she had on. My mom said that she used to wear that every day to work. The ghost hunter said that other ghost were passing through my house. My brother also came home one night and he found my grandma's driver's license on the ground by the front door.

I hope you send me comments and I will be happy to answer any of your questions. Thanks for reading my story.

Orb by the Mirror,United Kingdom,Orbs / Lights / Mists,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Orbs / Lights / Mists :: Orb by the Mirror

O ne night when I was looking in the mirror doing my hair, this dash of light caught my eye. I turned round and there was this ball of light that flew into the wall. After that I didn't dare look in the mirror again. Until I moved out of my room. I didn't see the orb again, well that's what I thought.

After that I saw even more orbs. I went to scotland for a week's holiday and we took about 33 photos. Then when we got them developed, there was about 16 orbs appeared on just two photos and the strange and freaky thing was that it was the first time we had been to scotland, after my granddad lesly moore had just died. Only two of my friends know and well, of course, my mam and dad and my brother aaron knows. Then after that, there was my last encounter with orbs.

One night when I was on my computer I went into my brother's room and I was just talking to him and the same orb appeared right above his head and vanished. I didn't say anything, I just went into my room thinking how on earth did it appear again. And I did not see any orbs again and from this day I have never looked at that photo again.

W e got on the ship and nothing felt wrong. I took many pictures. When we finally went downstairs, I could feel a paranormal being in the room with me, my cousin, and my grandpa. Well I took many pictures. I didn't look at the pictures yet. We went into the engine room barber shop and a lot of stuff deeper downstairs. I took many pictures there too. Especially when I felt a cold spot, hot spot, and things brushing against my leg. In the hospital wing, my cousin made a joke about being shot with a needle by a ghost. While we were in there, he kept on getting poked. He had marks where he was poked that wasn't there before.

We finally went through there, watched a movie and took my sister and my other cousin with us. Nothing happened because a lot of people were down there too... I believe.

We finally got back in the car (we were about to get a ticket for coming back late). I looked at the pictures and I would get a blurry picture. I would see figures that were not there before. One of the ghosts looks like Michael Jackson. It was funny.

If you would like to see a few of my pictures go to photobucket and look up whbabygurl. My album has just a few.

Well I hope you like my ghost story. Happy ghost hunting to all and me!

Demonic Ghost?,"Rhode Island, United States",Photographs / Videos / EVP,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Photographs / Videos / EVP :: Demonic Ghost?

H ey, it's me again, Tiffany. I recently submitted a story about some ghost experiences in my grandmother's house. Well, just yesterday me and my friend Danielle were hanging out. We were walking around and she started talking about an old factory building where ""satan worshipers"" would go and perform rituals. She showed me the window of the room (the whole factory is fenced off with no way in because soon it will be torn down) and under the window is spray-painted the satanic symbol made to look as if it's dripping blood.

We continued walking around the building and I began snapping pictures of all the broken windows. I gotten home and began looking at them. I noticed something in one of the windows. It looks like a demonic face!

I showed a few people and they also see the face. There was nothing in the room or on the ceiling so what else could it be? I think it may be the same room as the satanic rituals were performed. The symbol was in the back of the building under the room and I think this picture is the front of the room, believe it or not.

I was also told two guys went in the room not too long ago and said the room had a weird feel to it... My friend Danielle is very receptive and open to the supernatural (I could be here all day listing her experiences). She hears voices and sees things so maybe she managed to ""bring"" this ghost out?

Fighting the Spirits,United Kingdom,Old Hags / Night Attacks / Sleep Paralysis,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Old Hags / Night Attacks / Sleep Paralysis :: Fighting the Spirits

I t's me again and as you know, I have posted quite a few stories on here and I'm quite new. But this story is based on what happened to me one night when I visited Nigeria my home-town. See, in my country we believe in evil spirits and people using evil things to get at people and this thing is very popular in our family in our country and since the day that I was born, there has been ongoing hatred and evil presences and wicked beings on my dad's side of the family where most of the trouble is.

One time at the age of 8 I went to nigeria with my dad and we had been sharing a room (and bed) at the time in his mother's house (where some of the others live) and this is what happened. It was night time and I slept on the window side and I was fast asleep and suddenly, although I could see nothing in my sleep and I knew I wasn't dreaming, it was like I was awake in the spirit realm. I started fighting with some unseen force or presence! I knew it was someone from the family that had sent it to us that night to harm us, because they are jealous of my father's success and I thank God until this day that he gave me the power to fight whatever it was!

I don't know what it was but it was definitely an evil spirit and I knew it was coming to harm us and although my eyes were closed and I was barely conscious in my (conscious mind) that I know of anyway, I was able to do what I did. As I was fighting with this thing, little did I know that I was actually fighting it in the real world because I opened my eyes and found my self fighting with the air and stopped when my dad woke up beside me and asked if I was ok and I replied yes, that my leg was a little itchy and believing me he went to sleep.

I could hardly sleep the rest of the night watching out for anything ready to harm us. I mostly fight these things in my sleep fiercely and I know I'm fighting them in real life because I can feel everything but these things only happen in my dreams now. I think these things have done it on purpose and only happens in dreams so that if they were fighting me and I needed help, I couldn't get it because no one can see it.

But thank God for my Mother and Father who KNOW these things are true because they've been to see religious people all over the world who have told them these things and they can see it, and at one point one of the culprits was even that close to admitting his part in the war. Till this day the family still has this battle in the spiritual realm and I will continue to play my part until the evil is destroyed. I know this sounds a little unreal because most people don't believe me but I'm just saying now that you don't have to believe because I know what I am saying is true.

The Farmer and his Daughter,"New Jersey, United States",Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: The Farmer and his Daughter

I was eight years old when we moved to Colts Neck, New Jersey in 1976. My parents had the house built on about an acre and a half of property. The homes in the area were pretty new although the town itself dated back to the seventeen hundreds. My family is large so we were all excited to move into the six bedroom colonial. My two brothers were the oldest and my parents gave them the two downstairs bedrooms that jutted off the wing of the garage.

For the first year, things were normal until the day my brother Mike began complaining of noises outside his bedroom window. At first, he said it sounded like bushes rustling in the wind and scraping against the siding and glass panes. My mom was skeptical since there were no bushes or shrubs planted in the back of the house.

As months went by, the noises continued and increased to a soft thud and then a sliding sound, like a person bailing hay against a barn wall. He didn't seem to mind the noises all that much but when his closet doors would open by themselves it really freaked him out and he tried to tell our parents that he thought something was in the house but of course, they were cynical, since no one else had experienced anything. My tough seventeen year old brother began sleeping with the lights and his t.v. on.

Before long, things started to disappear and reappear in very odd places. Car keys would disappear from the table and turn up in the kitchen cabinets. My brother's watch vanished for two weeks before ending up in the garage under a box of christmas decorations. Even my grandmother's false teeth went missing never to return. (They weren't in her mouth!)

When my oldest brother Rene left for college, I would stay in his room sometimes. He had a great t.v. and an even better stereo system. The room was cold very often and when I slept there, I would have the most vivid dreams, not scary but incredibly real. On several occasions, I would wake up freezing to find the blankets piled on the floor at the foot of the bed. Despite that, I really enjoyed that room until my brother's girlfriend came to stay one weekend.

We were eating breakfast when she asked my dad if he came into the bedroom the previous night. My dad said he hadn't. My brother Rene grew very quiet when I think back to it. She went on to explain an eerie story. She said she woke when she heard her name being called. It was a man's voice and when she answered there was no response. Attributing it to a dream, she drifted back to sleep only to be called again. This time she saw the figure of a man standing over her. She said he was tall and thin and on further groggy observation, noticed he had sharp features and was wearing a floppy brimmed hat and a frockish type coat. She could not see his eyes but he was illuminated by a faint bluish aura. He stood for a moment and then made his way to the foot of the bed and out the wall. Thinking it was a dream, she went back to sleep.

By this time my brother was pretty pale at listening to her story. Rene is a pure cynic, black or white only, no gray area need apply. He hesitantly told of an identical experience that had happened to him a few weeks before leaving for Glassboro State. He never mentioned it for fear we all would think he was crazy. His girl was pretty mad that he hadn't told her and let her sleep in the room. Night lights became a staple in that back bedroom from then on.

Not long after, my mom was in the kitchen. She turned to put something on the counter when she saw the figure of a little girl dressed in period clothing, bonnet and all staring out our picture window. As soon as she saw her she vanished. Like I said, Colts Neck is old. Phalanx Rd was a main thorofare for the original settlers. Archeologists would do digs in the surrounding areas and find old glass medicine bottles, farming yokes and remains of old homes that used to be. Back in the woods by the reservoir there is a grave monument. I was young and can't remember the name or the inscription but it was very old and very out of place back there in the undeveloped woods.

Was it the spirit of a farmer that used to live and farm on the land our house was built on? Was that his daughter? Did they die in the rumored fire at Phalanx and don't know they've gone? I guess we'll never know. We moved out in 1984 and settled into a very unhaunted house in Whippany.

I wonder if the people that took our place have had any experiences and if my mom who passed in that house in 1983 has left her impression there. It certainly opened my eyes to the mysteries that our human form cannot not fathom or solve.

The Sign for my Grandma,Belgium,Family / Friends Visits,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Family / Friends Visits :: The Sign for my Grandma

H i, I live in Belgium and I'm 18 years old. It's been almost 2 years that my grandma has passed away. She struggled for her life so in a way I felt relieved that she had found peace, but I started feeling guilty because of it. She doesn't have a grave (she's been cremated) so I couldn't go see her and that just made my feeling worse.

I felt like I was ""betraying"" her. Every night before I go to sleep I speak to her, hoping that she can hear me, when one night something weird happened in my dreams. Suddenly I was sitting in her house on my seat and she was sitting in front of me. She smiled and said that she could hear me and that she was doing fine. She even called me ""princess"" (something she used to say to me) and said that my feelings were not wrong. She told me she would stand by me every step of my life. After that she disappeared.

I woke up and I screamed. Before that dream, I felt alone even when I was with my friends, something of me was gone forever. My mom says that it was really her because I was always her most precious grandchild. I don't know if it was real but I hope it was because I miss her so much! I loved her more then anyone and I still feel alone sometimes. I cry when nobody is watching ...

A Cry in the Night,"Missouri, United States",Misc,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Misc :: A Cry in the Night

S ome people believe 13 is an unlucky number, but to me, it's grand. My 13th birthday was like the others, family gathered for the celebration, gifts were given and happiness was shared. It began around 8:00pm when my cousin Tiffany stayed the night with me, and her being 9 months younger. My parents dropped my little brother off at my grandma's and they were going to go see a movie. My cousin's been around more then me. Being us, we were on the computer goofing off on, when she thought she heard someone scream. I told her she was crazy and thought of it. She kept on telling me she could hear someone.

Me being the oh so smart one said, ""Whoever's talking to my cousin would you shut it up!"" Tiffany looked to me and told me they were mad. I still thought she was joking, so I said, ""Yea, sure they are...""

Later that night, my parents had come home and we were going to bed. We were laying in my bed when there was this horrid odor. We blamed each other for having gas. She said that it was me, but I told her it wasn't. Then, as I was about to see where the smell came from, there was a scream. It couldn't have been Tiffany, because she was sitting right beside me. We sat in the bed terrified of whatever it was.

We both looked to where we thought the scream had come from. She said the window and I said my T.V., both in the same area. I thought about getting up to see what or who had screamed, but I was too afraid of what it may be. Throughout the whole night, neither of us got much sleep.

The next morning, we awoke and asked my parents if they heard anything last night. My dad thought we were crazy and said those scary movies got to us. But how, we both heard it? Looking back everyday I wonder, was it really just our minds playing tricks on us, or was it something more?

Prank Gone Too Far,"Missouri, United States",Apparitions / Voices / Touches,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Apparitions / Voices / Touches :: Prank Gone Too Far

G irls. Sleepovers. They were meant for each other. Especially when it's just you and a friend that act as if you were sisters. Spending the night at my friend Angela's House (we act as if we were sisters) we pull pranks on her mom, and her dad gets us back.

Being suckers for scary movies, we decided to watch The Grudge 2 at nearly 1 in the morning. Angela makes me sit by the window, just in case something tries to come in, they get me first (aren't I lucky). It was coming for the part where someone was going to die when

Her dad jumped out of the closet and scared us. I've never screamed so loud in my life. He laughed and joked at us while we were trying to make it look as if we knew he was there the whole time.

""Yea sure dad... uh-huh. We never knew you were there"" we kept on telling those lies until he laughed his way out of the room. Eventually we started up the movie again and watched it through.

""How bout we watch The Texas Chainsaw Massacre?"" Angela asked.

Watching that scared us out of our skins. I thought we'd never get to sleep.

Later that night, we were sleeping, me next to the window (of course) when we were awoke my the sound of a chainsaw. We were so scared we nearly wet ourselves.

Laughing once more, was her father who we were ticked at. He laughed until he cried, then left the room. ""Oh you shouldn't have done that,"" her mom said in the hallway between Angela's room and the bathroom.

""The neighbors are going to have a fit if you keep those screaming,"" her mom said.

Then her mom came in and told us she was sorry for what Angela's dad did to us. We told her it was fine, but we said nothing about getting him back.

We made a plan, to put The Ring on in their room and then we would hide under their bed so they would freak out. It sounded good, until we couldn't find the movie. We searched everywhere for it (in her room) and she remembered it was in the living room.

The living room is down the hall from her parent's room and they always kept the door open. Somehow, we had to get past them without them seeing or hearing us. Slowly, we snuck into the living room, she got the movie and I hid under the bed (the bed is against the wall with the T.V. in front and windows on both sides). She put the movie in to where she was coming out of the well (it was paused), and grabbed the other remotes.

She snuck under the bed and pushed play, but we heard nothing. She thought she hadn't pushed the button hard enough, so she tried again. Still nothing. She tried once more, but then the T.V. turned off. I thought one of us had hit the power button so she turned the T.V. back on, but it turned off again. We were freaked out.

She just gasped and hit my arm. I looked to where she was looking, and there was someone looking, no glaring in on us.

""Angela... we're on the 2nd floor"", I said. She said nothing. How could someone be there, looking in on us. We stayed quiet. We watched the person as they watched us.

Terrified, we did nothing. We jumped as the T.V. turned on full blast to where we wanted it to start. Her parents jumped out of bed and tried to turn it off, but somehow couldn't. Finally Angela's dad unplugged the T.V. and looked for the remotes. I'm not sure how, but he saw us under the bad and told us to come out. When we did we told him about the prank and about someone looking into the room. He said that there was no way someone could get onto the 2nd story and look in at us. He said it was so dark in there, they wouldn't even be able to see us.

Grandma's Trailer,"Montana, United States",Apparitions / Voices / Touches,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Apparitions / Voices / Touches :: Grandma's Trailer

W hen I was 9, we had christmas at my grandma's. It was Christmas Eve and my mom, dad and older brother went down the street to my aunt's house for a party. My grandma had put me and my little brother to bed in the middle bedroom of the single wide trailer. I hated this room and never ever slept in it, I always slept in the first room with my mom and dad.

Well me and my little brother went to bed. A few hours later, my mom woke me up I was in a cold sweat. She took me in to their first bed room and made a bed for me on the floor. She asked if I was okay as I had been talking in my sleep. I told her that there was something in that room and they didn't like me. Mom shook her head and told me it had just been a bad dream.

Later that night I was awaken by scratching on the door, when I opened my eyes I saw the tall pale man reaching out for me. I started to scream. I was scared, I woke up my mom and she moved me to the other side of the bed away from the door.

The next morning we got dressed and had breakfast, then went to my aunt's house for exchanging of gifts and christmas dinner. We went back home the next day.

It was 7 years later, I had found out a man lost his wife and daughter, he went crazy and killed him self in that room. Come to find out I looked just like his little girl.

Unwanted Visitor,"Florida, United States",Non Human Entities,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Non Human Entities :: Unwanted Visitor

G rowing up, I always liked anyone else who had older siblings and have had them tell me stories to scare me. Now on this particular story it wouldn't have been so bad if it were just my oldest brother telling me the story, but I remember my mother telling me as well... Let me start off by saying I come from a big family, there are 6 of us ""kids"" that my mom had, 4 older boys, I and my younger brother.

The story begins in a little house we all lived in (except my younger brother on account he wasn't born yet.) There were 3 bedrooms in the home, the first bedroom my two oldest brothers shared, second one my 2 younger of the 4 brothers shared and then there was me who slept in my mom's room in a cradle. According to my oldest brother, one night before going to bed, all of them were being rowdy and decided they all wanted to sleep in the same room to see who could stay up the longest, so they went ahead and asked for my mom's permission to sleep all together in one room. My mom said it was ok on one condition, that they all not be so loud (because I was asleep) and tried to at least go to bed at a decent hour. They agreed and went to the room.

At one point the boys began to get loud and rowdy again and my mom was forced to go in and give a warning to them, as she turned away she saw my oldest brother stick out his tongue at her and she quickly turned back and told him that it wasn't nice to do that and that God didn't like little boys being so hateful and that if he continued to do that, the ""devil"" would snatch his tongue. Now keep in mind my mother who at that time was a profound catholic and not to mention, hispanic, and well God and the Devil played big roles in her life.

My brother not liking that comment she made in return said, ""well if that's true then I'll be seeing him soon,"" my mom scorned at him and turned and walked out the room. As the night progressed, my brother said he was the last to fall asleep and as he was drifting off, he felt someone grab the blankets and pull them off him abruptly. He, thinking it was one of my other brothers messing with him, snatched the blankets back and yelled ""Alex stop doing that!"" And of course there was no response from Alex because he was fast asleep. My brother was laying on his side, keep in mind, and said he felt someone tug at his toes. He opened his eyes this time to see if it was Alex or one of the other boys and to his surprise he saw a very dark figure staring back at him at the end of the bed near his feet.

My brother, terrified, said he couldn't get a sound out of his mouth and continued to watch as this figure climbed on top of the bed and somewhat sit on him with a devilish grin pinning him down. My brother froze in horror as he heard this figure say what he says sounded like ""maybe next time you'll listen to your mother..."" After that my brother said he seemed to have just kind of passed out.

He woke a few moments later, confused and scared, and ran to my mom who was sitting in the kitchen waiting up on our dad to get home from work. He began to tell my mom the story and to his amazement my mother said she believed him and began to tell him that moments after the boys had settled to fall asleep, in the corner of her eye she spotted a dark figure passing from living room to hallway but thought it was nothing and passed it off as of her being tired from a long day and was just seeing things. To their amazement they found what appeared to be scratches on his back, arms and one leading from his cheek down to the side of his mouth. My brother horrified by what he experienced never again back talked or stuck his tongue out at our mother in hopes that he would never experience that again.

As you are sure aware of, as a little girl hearing this story, it certainly scared me and then hearing it from my mom as well... you get the picture... I hope you all enjoy my little story.

Uncle Rocky part 1,Canada,Family / Friends Visits,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Family / Friends Visits :: Uncle Rocky part 1

I have a very long story that has spanned 6 years so far and is still carrying on to this day. I'm not sure that you will want everything at once so I guess I'll try to split it up a bit. When things first started I didn't keep a very good record but I've actually kept a detailed journal for some time now. This will seem a bit scattered for the first part but I'll try to have it make some sense for you.

I need to give you some background first. Ronny is my husband's older brother and very much the black sheep of the family. So much so that most of them wouldn't even acknowledge that he was part of the family. Sadly enough, even his parents. He had caused them a lot of grief when he was young. You could find all kinds of reasons why he was the way he was today, with all the titles they have, such as ADD or (I'm sure in his case ADHD-attention deficit hyperactivity disorder). He had a higher than average IQ but never had any help with things. He was a fabulous guy, help you with anything but always had some kind of scheme going on in the background. Never to involve us in any way. My family was the closest with him and his family. We (hubby) let by-gones be by-gones and I never knew him in his really troublesome days. To me he was just a really good natured guy who was always ready to laugh and tease. Ronny, known as Uncle Rocky to my kids, was a fantastic Uncle. The Uncle you were always happy to see. They loved him dearly, and he was always around for them. He was killed in a stupid car accident in 2000, just a few weeks before we were due to move here. Just a few weeks before his birthday.

We had plans of moving back here from up north and Ronny was really excited and said he knew exactly where our house was, he walked by every week-end on his way to the local flea market. I looked forward to early morning coffee visits while he was passing by. When he died, we were so in shock. We couldn't believe it. Everyone who came to his funeral said 'Oh the famous Gary and family, he was really looking forward to you moving down' Even cops who had arrested him had shown up at his funeral, that's how likable he was. My kids always had a really close bond with him, especially my oldest. He could almost read his mind, or mine when it came to Uncle Rocky.

This already pretty long but I felt you needed to know the background. Things started to happen right after we got here. I sort of didn't make a connection right away, but now I think I have the answer down pat.

One of the first things I noticed was my youngest son's closet. It was very sticky and you really had to give it a jerk to open it. Except during the day when he was at school, I would always find it open, then I would close it. The little fellow was afraid of the monster that he might find in there. Then every night I'd find myself having to close it again because it would be open again. He'd always call me in at bedtime to close it.

We also had the typical phone calls where there would simply be a dead line, no matter if it rang once or ten times. Then there were the calls that just had a dial tone. Lots of them. This went on for months and months. It still happens to this day, just today as a matter of fact. It has really settled down though.

In the evening, after dark I would see this green ribbon of light traveling across the back of the yard, back and forth. Swoops and arcs. Then in the daylight it would be shadows doing the same. The thing was the back of the yard is in shadow all day and night. This happened a lot for a year or so and then eased off. Maybe I just don't notice it anymore.

In the house I often see shadows cross the door frames. They stop and sort of look at me but when I look at them, they are gone. This usually happens when I'm alone. And very often.

A few times (at least 3) when my husband and I have gone away in the morning we have been a little late coming home for my boys' lunch hour. We would be worried about them having to be outside and worrying about us. Each time they were in the house. We'd ask how they got in and they'd tell us the back door was open. After the first time we'd make absolutely certain the back door deadbolt was locked and yet they would still be in the house. It seemed Uncle Rocky would be looking out for them, making sure they were safe.

When my husband was in high school he made a sort of grandfather clock that hung on the wall. It has a very tight latch and you have to use two hands to open it to wind it. For the longest time it would be open at least every other day. This was so weird. This goes along with a couple of other clock stories I have to tell. I think I should save some of the rest for later since this is so long.

Next time you'll know the history and I'll tell you a lot of other things that have happened over the years. You'll see why I'm a firm believer. I just thought it was time to share some of this and I hope you've enjoyed reading this and will want to read the rest. Thank you for reading some of my tale.

Our Old Farm House,"Ohio, United States",Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: Our Old Farm House

I grew up in a small town (more projects than anything else, we lived in the ""new homes""), before moving to a small farming community when my mother divorced my father. We moved in with my mother's new husband in his farm house. This house had all the makings of a haunted home. The basement had a dirt floor room, very low ceilings, the only thing we had down there were shelves for when we canned. I rarely ever went down there.

I had a small room downstairs (that was previously used as an office), while my parents and my brothers' room was upstairs. I always felt uneasy being in that home, just looking at it gives me the goose bumps to this day.

A couple of things happened... My brother, step-father and I were in the living room one afternoon and all the sudden we heard the upstairs toilet flush and the lid slam. My heart was pounding. My step-dad went on to say ""I guess they have to go too!"" I was not amused. Another incident occurred when I was looking in my closet (it was upstairs, because my room did not have one) and I saw a man with long hair, a flannel shirt and jeans walk out of the bathroom and into the wall. I think I was so shocked at what I saw, it almost felt like I couldn't control my body. I walked down the stairs and into the kitchen and just stood there dumbfounded. My step-dad walked in and asked what was wrong, and I said ""I think I just saw a ghost..."" I explained to him what I saw and he told me that in the late 70s and man fell into a wood chipper at a local company who used to live in the house, he was friends with him. He then went on to tell me that he thinks he sees things all the time. I was very happy to move out of that house.

This may sound silly, but even thought I get so scared about the supernatural, I am so interested in it. I just recently bought a house with my fiance and I just wonder if anything will happen here. I've read a lot of stories that started out with ""everything was normal until...""

I Was There!,"Nebraska, United States",Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: I Was There!

I am a Christian, not a 'holy roller' but a Christian. I believe in God and Christ and the Bible. I try to live my life as a decent person and raise my family as such. As a Christian, I have tried to speak with a few ministers, even a Catholic Priest regarding these happenings. I have been told that if I believe in anything paranormal, I can not be a true Christian. Well, I disagree completely. I was there. I know what happened; I remember all as if it was yesterday. My sister also remembers every detail as if it where yesterday (not that she will talk about it all that much, for a long time she would not talk about it at all, to anyone).

Now, I feel I have found a venue where I can share my experiences, get them out and share them with others who are sharing as well. Before the loss of my grandpa, he acknowledged the happenings in the house. My parent also finally spoke of them. Very infrequently, then would change the subject. My parents divorced about 4 years after this, but even separately, they would not speak much about this house. When they did, they were still so frightened it almost made them seem angry.

When I was a child, about 9, my sister was 5; we lived in a small older house in Omaha. I believe they are called cement slab houses because they do not have a basement, just a cement slab as a foundation. This house had the strangest lay out I had ever and have ever seen. As you walked in through the one and only door to the house you entered the kitchen, it was very large, then a small hallway with the bathroom off to the left a little further down the hallway and there was a laundry room. At the end of this hallway was a staircase leading up to the second floor. At the top of the stairs was a bedroom, then a living room/family room, another bedroom and a sun porch.

My Grandpa had the first bedroom at the top of the stairs, and then my parents had the second bedroom after the living room. My sister and I shared the sun porch. My Mom and Grandpa had fixed it up as the perfect bedroom for little girls with curtains and heat vents, all frilly and cute.

One evening my sister and I were on the main floor readying for bed. We had been up late that night for some reason and needed to get our teeth brushed and pajamas on to get to bed. It was about 11:00 PM. I was waiting for my sister to finish in the bathroom. As she was the youngest, I let her go first. She had the door slightly ajar and I was sitting on the small step that led up from the kitchen to the hallway right outside the bathroom door reading. All of the sudden I heard my sister scream. I looked over at the bathroom door and noticed that the light had gone out. I ran into the bathroom and there on the window curtain was a man's face with longer light brown hair and beard and mustache. There was a bright red velvet cloth around his shoulders and a tremendous bright glow around his whole face and shoulders. The entire room seemed to illuminate this glow. My sister inched beside me; we were of course staring at the... whatever it was. It said ""Do not turn on the lights, I will not hurt you."" Yeah, right! I turned on the lights as quick as I could and it was gone. I spent the next 10-20 minutes trying to convince my sister that it was all a joke, all our imagination and we should just go to bed. I was shaking inside worse than I can remember even to this point in my life.

We went to bed. I of course was wide awake for what seemed like forever. All at once, around 1:00 AM my Dad jumps up and all of us hear a tremendous racket on the second floor, which we were on. All of the doors were opening and slamming shut, the television was turning itself of and on repeatedly, all of the lights were turning themselves off and on. We all ran into the living room. We had a small bed on wheels that folded in 2 for easy storage. It was in the closet in the living room. My mom grabbed my sisters and my hand and started to run for the doorway that would lead to the stairs and out. The bed on wheels zoomed across the floor and blocked the door way. My mom was pulling on the bed from one side and my grandpa was pushing from the other. The bed wouldn't budge. I am not sure what my dad was doing at the time, but he ran up and started pulling on the bed also. It would not move! My sister had silent tears streaming her cheeks. All of the sudden everything just stopped. We all went to the kitchen on the main floor. Calmed down with my dad trying to recite some logical answer for what had just occurred (there was none. After about half and hour, we all went back to bed, hoping to salvage some rest.)

I remember looking at the clock, it said 1:45. I must have dozed off because I was awoken again, looked at the clock and it said 3:00. The main floor was now making a terrible racket. It sounded like the house was going to crash down around us. My dad and grandpa ran to the stairs and went down to about the fourth stair from the bottom, I was supposed to stay put, again - Yeah, right! I had a hold of the back of my grandpa's robe. Again, on this floor the lights were going on and off, faucets in the kitchen and bathroom on and off, doors opening and closing. We had a gas stove in the kitchen and the burners where even igniting and then turning off over and over again. I honestly don't know how long this lasted. It all stopped, leaving the front door open. My parents and grandpas grabbed my sister and my hand and ran outside. We were outside for about 45 minutes or so when my parents decided it was their house and nobody (or nothing) was going to chase them from it. We all went back in. My sister slept with my parents, I slept with my grandpa.

There were many, many other incidents in this house. We moved about 6 months after this first night I have described. I have driven by this house many times since I have had my own family. It is still there. I know for a fact it has changed owners and renters numerous times. At the top of the hill from the house, which leads to a dead end there was a small (very small, but long) church. It was torn down about 20 years ago. It was rumored that this church had been used as a satanic church with rituals and sacrifices. I am not sure who, what or why it was torn down. It never had a sign with a name any where near the church so I could investigate further and I am not sure I would if I could. These events seemed to open up some type of 'door' because, well let's just say there have been strange things happened my entire life. Of course not everyday, but enough.

Is It Real? 2,Portugal,Misc,"I f you all have read my first story , I thought that I had a ghost in my room, now I'm sure. And as I said then, things that seemed normal to me before are now revealing to be... unusual.

- Younger sibling waking up in the middle of the night screaming in panic without reason (and in the next morning she wouldn't remember a thing about it), let me tell you it was difficult to calm her down!

- When my only sister was younger she had a weird fear, she was afraid of any of us falling asleep before her. If we did, she said she felt alone; when we asked why she was afraid of that, the little one didn't know why...

Or when sometimes I woke in the middle of the night (and I'm a bit of a heavy sleeper), sometimes calm and sometimes scared, yet without remembering why. I read that ghosts can sort of manipulate our dreams, because it's the time when we're most vulnerable. I suspect that it's what happens both with me and my sister.

My bedroom has a quite, well, silent or too calm aura or whatever. I'm not sensible to paranormal, unfortunately for my curiosity, but I try as hard as I can to try and see something odd.

It never ever happened, nothing serious. My sudden need to post these... well, facts, was because I was just talking about this and it ringed a bell. Tell me what you think about it!

Creepy Bathroom,"Pennsylvania, United States",Misc,"I have lived in my house for almost a year now and everything has been fine. For the past week I have been having trouble sleeping for no reason. I started getting this strange vibe from the house for about three days now. Every time I walk in here I get extremely sick to my stomach and I feel like someone or something is trying to get me out possibly for my own good? I don't feel like my house is threatening me or anything I just feel as if something is trying to protect me from this house or scare me out of it.

I started noticing all these flies in my bathroom scattered throughout it. I thought nothing of this... This morning as I was checking my email and my five year old son was watching tv, we heard water dripping, the noise drowned out because of planes passing by overhead so I ignored it. The sound grew louder so I walked to the bathroom and my hot water was on full blast in my tub. There is no way my son did it he was next to me. We live alone and there's only one way someone could have got in and that's through my front door.

The other strange thing was when I came home from work today there was a note on my door that was stuck in between the door knob and door frame. When I opened it, it said ""Check your breakers and GFI switches"" I called my ex husband to see what a GFI switch was and he said I have only one and it's in my bathroom... It's the switch with the test and reset button. I checked them and it looked fine to me. Who on earth cold have written this note and why? I am the only house on my block, I do not have neighbors. So what in the world is going on with my bathroom all the sudden? The note, the flies, the water? I am completely freaked out and I do not feel safe.

I can't take the horrible feeling this house is throwing at me? Has anyone ever heard of this before? Am I over reacting? Not to mention for the past week I have also had these nightmares. I haven't had a nightmare in years! It's always the same... I have to protect my son from something. Please someone help me, I can't take this anymore.

Little Girl in White Dress Swinging,"Texas, United States",Apparitions / Voices / Touches,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Apparitions / Voices / Touches :: Little Girl in White Dress Swinging

O ne night, my 2 friends, my brother, my mom and I went outside at 12 o'clock at night. We were all just talking and laughing until I saw a little girl swinging with a swing on a tree at one of my friend's house. I know my friend told me a lot of paranormal stuff happens in his house but I haven't heard about her. She had a white dress and long black hair and you couldn't see her face.

I thought I was crazy but I asked my mom and friends if they saw what I saw. They said yes but I asked them what did they really see. They told me and it was the same thing that I see, the little girl swinging with a white dress. We all got scared and ran into the house.

Ever since that day I keep seeing her everywhere I go, even my mom see her. I don't fell like she is a bad ghost, she seems friendly. One time my mom told me she thinks she is the little girl I used to talk with in my sleep, outside the window. She tried to get me outside to play with her but before I did, my mom stop me by saying ""Irene go to sleep"" and I did. This all happened right after me and my mom saw another spirit who was in all black, we couldn't see his face cause he had a black hat on with a long big coat. I saw him 2 times in the hospital but before anything could happen, my grandma orb saved me twice. The same thing happen with my mom but my grandma was alive then.

Paralysis Demons,"Georgia, United States",Old Hags / Night Attacks / Sleep Paralysis,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Old Hags / Night Attacks / Sleep Paralysis :: Paralysis Demons

I am scared to death. I have had paralysis since I was 14. It has gotten worse in the past 4 months. I am a Christian woman. I was saved at the age of 17. Things have been good until lately. I will be in bed and I'll know when it's going to happen because I'll hear this noise in my ear, like something is going by it really fast. Kinda like a whoosh noise. Then I can't move.

One night I floated over my bed. Another night a demon sat on my chest and started shaking its head really fast on top of me. Other nights they try to get between my legs. I have panic attacks, and am on meds for it. I thought that's what it was because my husband swore I was asleep. Deep down inside, I knew this was really happening.

Well, today I talked to my Mom who lives in Florida. We have never really talked about this stuff, except for when it happened when I was younger. I am not exaggerating when I say that the SAME EXACT thing is happening to her. It even starts off with the same noise. She's actually been tossed up in the air and back onto the bed. This happens when we're alone, or when our husbands are sleeping. My Sister killed herself on July 10, 07. It has gotten worse, because I have been trying to get closer to God since our tragedy. I read the Bible everyday, and pray a lot.

The closer I get the Lord, the more Satan tries to get to me. I want to know how to stop this. Please help!

Haunted Field,"New York, United States",Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: Haunted Field

W hen I was about 10 years old, a house set deep within a 25 acre field about a quarter mile from my childhood home caught fire and a father and son were killed while asleep. Fast-forward 20 years... the house that was located at the bottom of the hill that made up the vast hayfield has become overgrown with hundreds of trees. It defies logic as there are literally hundreds of trees in a 20 x 30 lot that once was occupied by the house. The trees are literally so close together that you cannot even walk through the patch. There are no other trees in the entire field.

Another interesting note is that there is a noticeable 20 degree drop in temperature at that location. To be exact, two steps away from the location is literally 20 degrees hotter than when stepping into the spot. We ruled out underground springs and vents and drafts from the hill flowing downward. In fact, it is only this 20 x 30 plot in the entire field that has a noticeable temperature shift.

I have taken people to this spot and to their amazement they too felt the sudden drop in temp. Many people over the years used the field as a ""make-out"" spot by parking their cars there. They all had a sense of being watched while there. The field has since been fenced in preventing anyone from entering with their cars.

I became somewhat complacent about the site but now I feel inclined to finally investigate the site further. And now that I just purchased a home at the top of this hill adjacent to the field, my curiosity is once again peaked.

Supernatural Trees,United Kingdom,Orbs / Lights / Mists,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Orbs / Lights / Mists :: Supernatural Trees

H i my name is Michael and I'm 15 years of age. I live in manchester in a place called blackley and I have experienced something that will stick with me forever. I've never been scared of the supernatural but this has changed my point of view and psychology. This happened about 2 or 3 years ago, I got up in the middle of the night feeling weary and unable to sleep. I didn't feel scared at all, I just felt curious. I lurked into my mam's bedroom to get some fresh air, I looked through the wide open window and I couldn't help to notice the trees from across the road, there was split apart with a glowing herd of light looking in my direction.

I didn't retaliate because at the moment that seemed normal to me. I went and got my mam and she said she could see it to, she didn't say anything, she seemed shocked. I felt a sudden rush of tiredness so I left my mam's bedroom and got in bed in my bedroom and went to sleep. In the morning I looked out the window to see, the trees were no longer in that position. I knew it wasn't just me because my mam saw it to and it felt so real. I got my mam again and showed her and she also notice the difference but at that instant, without talking to her, we never spoke of it again, it just didn't happen. But I know it did.

Since then I have been experiencing supernatural circumstances like voices, unknown movements and sights of shadows and orbs. I swear to you this is not made up it is a true event  and I have been through more, it scares me so muc,h I try to cut my self off by not thinking of them. But then something else happens.

A Man in my Aunt's House,"Pennsylvania, United States",Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: A Man in my Aunt's House

I was 7 years old when this experience happened, my mother, my father and my sister went to my aunt's house to swim with her twin daughters, but we had to change before we swam of course, so I went first. My aunt's house always gave me the chills but her daughters said nothing has ever happened. I notice something weird in that house all the time.

On that day I actually found out a fact I did not want to know, I was changing in my aunt's upstairs bathroom and I thought I had heard footsteps so I looked out the door and dropped the clothes I was wearing before, standing in disbelief of what I was seeing, I couldn't move at all, I just froze completely, it was a body of a man walking down her hall, he looked vicious and almost evil. I ran downstairs screaming and screaming, my mother knew in my eyes that I was scared to death, my aunt asked me what happened and I told her, she told me to calm down, that I was probably too hot to just get in the pool and calm down, I told my story to all the kids in the pool, they were amazed and scared at the same time.

My uncle went upstairs and checked out the bathroom and the hall way, he said there was nothing there but he did feel something behind him, so he did believe me. We stayed over at their house that night but I refused to go upstairs even with someone with me. That night was scary also, I fell asleep around 11:30 p.m., I was awaken by whispering in my ear, I sat up and gasped, it was that guy! I screamed in horror, my sister shot up off the air mattress and wanted to know what was wrong, I told her and she said she saw nothing and it was probably just a dream. I stayed up the rest of the night waiting for something else to happen, I wasn't going to let it take me for surprise. Nothing else happened until I saw him again in the morning, it seemed like he was following me and stalking me or something like that.

We went home that afternoon and we heard that the twins saw him later after we left and they called a priest to bless the house. I am older now and I haven't seen anything when I was there ever since it was blessed.

M y friends and I were hanging out and one of them told us the usual haunted story about a road. We were all bored so we decided to go check it out. We got about halfway down the road and decided to turn around, but right as we turned around the car went dead. I didn't think it was too spooky, but when my friend's cell went dead too it got a little creepy.

We sat there for a minute until the driver said, ""Uh... The light... Is back..."" We thought he was kidding until we turned around and saw a single motorcycle light flashing on and off. Three of my friends got out and two of them started screaming for voices to get out of their heads. One brought a golf club with him and he started swinging it wildly. My other friend and I were going to stay in the car, but when we heard the insanely loud motorcycle noise we decided it was time to bail.

We got out and we started to run while the light got closer, then one of my friends started shouting, ""The lights, can you see them?"" while trying to run into the woods he then said, ""They're smiling at me..."" We grabbed him and kept running. The motorcycle light reached the car then turned red.

We finally made it back to town and the cops wouldn't let us in the station because they thought we were high. We finally convinced them to go jump us off. We made it back to the car and my friend and I heard the cycle engine again, but the cops couldn't. They were saying, ""Stop playing with us..."" then they got scared and said, ""Let's get the - out of here..."" We all left, but a second cop car got there when we were leaving and said he'd go check it out. We've never been back.

It was about 2 years ago and we all saw and remember it. I have other creepy stories, however, none compare to what we saw that night.

The Strange Knocking,"Colorado, United States",Misc,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Misc :: The Strange Knocking

A couple nights ago, my sister and grandmother heard strange knocking at the door at about 1:00 am. My sister also heard someone walking in the hall. She thought it was my dad because of the way he drags his slippers, but he claimed that he never walked in the hall. Also, my neighbors had a party the first night the knocking started. My dad thinks it could have been one of them. My grandmother kept hearing the knocking until the day before yesterday. But, I think she's lying. I think she's trying to make me scared so I study.

But on the first night, there had to be knocking if two people heard it. There hasn't been knocking on the door lately. It could be any ghost out there knocking, such as my grandfather that passed away, or a ghost that lived in the house before my house was made because the land is old. I want to know how I can figure out what this is and if it will ever come again. One time I saw on a show that there was a man and his brother in a cottage and they heard knocking at the door. Is it an angel? Is it an evil spirit or the energy of an evil spirit? All these things I would like to hear comments from the readers.

Things That Could Never Be Explained,"Connecticut, United States",Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: Things That Could Never Be Explained

I don't know where to begin with this story, it all started after me and my room mate stopped being friends and I bought my first house. It was built in 1954 and was abandoned from 1979 until about 1991. I fell in love with the house the moment I saw it, it was small and had such a lovely retro feel to it.

I suppose the first thing that I noticed was odd within the first few days was the complete lack of animal life in the yard, I never saw nor heard a single bird or squirrel. It had an eerie silence to the place. In my first week of living there I remember that a can of soup had mysteriously made its way from the kitchen cabinet to behind my pillow. I hadn't had any guests in the house and I could see no reason for me having put it there.

After that about a week later I was sound asleep at around 2:30 a.m. my doorbell rang four times, very loud distinct rings. I got up and went to the front door, but no one was there, still half asleep I cursed the kids next door thinking they were playing tricks on me. However, before I went back, I glanced at the door bell. To my surprise the button was completely missing and the whole mechanism looked broken, I tried to ring the bell but with no luck, this sent a wave of fear up my spine, and I slept with the light on for two nights after.

After living in the house for several moths with a few weird happenings here and there, I decided to invite over a lifelong friend of mine, I'll call him Gary. Gary has never expressed any interest in the paranormal we have known each other since we were 10, it just wasn't something that interested him.

Before going to my new home, Gary and I had gone out to lunch, his personality was normal as well as his color. I noticed almost right away his attitude changed after we were in the house, as well as his color began to look pale. He started getting easily aggravated about little things, and started swearing frequently, he was like a whole different person.

At about 8:30 Gary just stood up and walked into the guest bedroom and went to sleep. He didn't even say anything he just left! I shrugged it off and went to bed myself shortly after. At about 1:10 a.m. I woke up to the noise of Gary power puking in the bathroom, I got out of bed and went to assist him in the bathroom.

When I walked in he was completely nude and curled into a ball rambling ""This place, this place is not right!"" or something to that effect. I decided to call 9-11 thinking he was on LSD or something along those lines.

The next morning I visited him in the Hospital, I asked him what had happened to him. He told me the doctors found no cause of the extreme vomiting or delusions, in fact the EMTS told him he started coming to ""reality"" shortly before arriving to the hospital. Gary also told me from the moment he entered the house, he began to feel very strange and that he kept getting grotesque and disturbing thoughts and images in his head, and felt a heavy presences lurking over him. Needless to say he refused to return to the house.

I lived in the house for six more months, living with unexplained noises and things being moved to weird places before I finally had gotten fed up with what ever it was in the house. I sold the house and moved out within a month. To this day when I drive by the home, I get a sinking feeling in my gut and I just want to run for my life.

Ragged Looking Man,United Kingdom,Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: Ragged Looking Man

I moved in to my house when I was little with my two older brothers and my mom. I never really had anything happen when I was little, but I have in the last few years. I can't remember what year it started as such and I can not remember the very 1st instant, but I am sure it's not my imagination.

In my house, when you walk through the font door, there is the stairs at the right and if you go a little further the front room is to your left, then a little further to the left again is the dining room then opposite the hall is the kitchen. When you go upstairs and go to the left there is one more step opposite the little step is my brother's room, then if you go right there is the bathroom, then turn left from the little step go down the landing and you've got my room opposite the landing and my mom's room to the left. So anyway now you know the gist of my house I'll begin.

I can remember in about either early 2006 or late 2005 being in my dining room alone and I was playing on my game cube when all of a sudden I saw a ragged looking man just kind of glaring at me, which freaked me out so I ran in to my front room where my family was.

That's not all, I had my friend around for a sleep over once and she was on the toilet and none else was upstairs so the door was wide open and I was half way up the stairs when the door slammed shut. I assumed it was her until she asked me if I did it and I was even watching the door when it slammed shut, and it wasn't her.

I decided to sleep in my mom's room that night because she has a double bed, before she went to bed she was finishing some jobs downstairs because it was a school night, and so as you can guess, I was in there alone. Now I didn't have a problem with that until this. A couple of minutes later I turned over and started to hear heavy breathing. Now at first I thought it could have been me so I held my breath and it carried on, and straight away I shouted ""MOM MOM MOM"". AS you can guess, she didn't believe me.

About six or seven months later, I thought all of that nonsense had stopped, but I was in my mom's room again that night and she was on an early shift at work that day because she's a nurse. She was in the bathroom and usually tend to wake up when she's getting ready and I was trying to get back to sleep, when suddenly I heard someone take a breath and it wasn't me and I was the only one in her room.

There have been many other instants in my house but those are the most dramatic ones. Please answer me back on this story I would much appreciate it love, the melon lover.

Mysterious Fog,"Pennsylvania, United States",Orbs / Lights / Mists,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Orbs / Lights / Mists :: Mysterious Fog

W hat am I about to tell you is 100% true. There is no exaggeration anywhere, I promise! I am still in shock and in amazement that this happened to me. I am still trying to figure out what the thing was. Last night, around ten O' clock, I believe, the strangest thing occurred in my life.

My sister decided to talk to our mom or something, so she left our room. I was the only one in the room, I was relaxing. I paced back and fourth. (I do this a lot at night) I sighed and sat on my sister's bed. Then I saw something out the window. I couldn't tell what it was, so I peered closer. It looked like a white hand almost. It was very bright, and it was sort of pretty. I thought it was an angel, but I wasn't sure. Could it be a ghost? It was the weirdest looking thing I ever saw. It happened so fast. I gasped and continued to stare. I wasn't scared... Just surprised. I ran out of the room to tell my sister.

She was still in my parents' room. I whispered to her to come in quickly in our room. I grabbed her by the hand and we were disappointed to see that the ghostly ""thing"" was gone when we entered our room. But I was glad to hear my sister believed me. Thank goodness! I'm planning to NEVER tell my parents because I know they would not believe such a thing.

Well, I'm still thinking about this ghostly encounter. I am still in shock. I just don't know if I will ever forget that moment. What do you think? Please leave comments if you wish.

We Meet Again,"New York, United States",Apparitions / Voices / Touches,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Apparitions / Voices / Touches :: We Meet Again

M y name is Justin and I have been in my brand new house for almost 5 years now and I still remember what I saw and to this day it still makes me keep the night light on. I used to live in Merrick before I moved to where I am now. It was a nice house but very small, therefore I moved later on, but a couple of days before the move I noticed something very odd in the middle of the night.

I was sleeping and it must have been really late in the night but I noticed that my bedroom light had turned on. I thought nothing of this, I was really tired and I just wanted to go back to bed. I then was about to get up and turn off my light when I saw a old skinny white haired lady standing in my doorway. I immediately thought my eyes were playing a trick on me so I rubbed my eyes and with no prevail, the figure was still there. At this point I was scared and pulled the covers over my head and didn't bother to shut of the light.

Two years after that, in our new house my dad wanted to clean up the attic in our house. The entrance to the attic is in my closet so I decided to help my dad. I found a left over album which what the pictures seemed to be the first owners of the house. I was rummaging through the pictures when I saw the same old lady that visited me two years before in my bedroom.

What was she doing I have no idea is that the same figure I saw, I believe so but to this day I'm still trying to figure this out.

Through my Bed Room Window,American Samoa,Old Hags / Night Attacks / Sleep Paralysis,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Old Hags / Night Attacks / Sleep Paralysis :: Through my Bed Room Window

T his story took place in the village of Masefau when I was about 7-8 years of age. I lived with my mother, her parents, and my brothers as well. My grandfather was the Reverend then. Our house was built right in front of the mountains. When my brothers and I were younger, our grandma had told us that we should never go in the back of our house after 10:00pm. Especially by ourselves, due to the fact that evil spirits would start to come out from the mountains that time.

I had thought my grandma was joking around until this one strange night. I had went to sleep around 9-10pm as always, but this time something had felt strange all of a sudden. Mind you that I sleep in my room by myself and that the only window that I have in my room faces the mountains. As I was laying in my bed, I heard the old faucet behind my window running and I also heard a man talking to his daughter, telling her to wash her hands. As I took a peak through my window to see who it was, there was no one there and all the voices and the sound of the running water had stopped.

As I laid back down in my bed I started to hear them again. This time when I looked out my window I saw a man with a little girl at the faucet and as they turned to look at me, all I saw were two pairs of bright red eyes looking at me. I tried screaming but I couldn't hear my voice. As I was screaming both the man and her daughter had started to get closer and closer. I had ran to my door to try and open it but it wouldn't open.

At that point I actually thought I was going to die because they were reaching over and started to choke me. I guess my grandma knew or had a feeling that I was in trouble. If it wasn't for her, I know that I wouldn't be here right now telling you my story. I had slept in my grand parents room that night after that horrific incident. The next morning as I woke up, my neck felt bruised. All I could hear that time was my family asking me why do I have bruises on my neck, as if someone had choked me. That's when my grandma had told us the story about the man and his daughter.

My grandma had said that a man and his daughter were looking for a place to sleep at night and came across the house we live in, but the family who lived there were so crual to them, especially the young girl whom lived in the house. The little girl who lived in the house use to stay in the room that I stayed in. That night as the man and his daughter were looking for a place to sleep, the little girl in the house had told them that they could sleep in her room, but the only way to get in there is to come through the back where her window was and that they had to wash their hands at the faucet in order for them to walk through the window.

The man and his daughter believed the little girl, so they did as the girl had told them. Once they had started to wash their hands the little girl started to laugh at them and also started to tease them saying that they were so stupid because they actually believed her. Then the next morning the family was getting ready to leave on their family vacation but couldn't look for the little girl. As the little girls parents went to her room looking for her, all they saw was blood all over the screen wire and the window in a shape of the little girl.

The scariest thing about it was, that the little girl was the same age as I was when this had happened to her and it also happened on the same day but just different years. Something had told me to go into my room so I did. When I got there, all I saw was BLOOD in a shape of a little girl all over the screen wire and the window. My grandpa said a little prayer in my room and told the spirits that they were welcomed to spend the night over or as long as they want until they find a new place to stay.

I was thinking to myself ""Is grand-dad's head screwed on tight or not?"". Then, I started to think about it, if a spirit visits you, the only reason why is for revenge so the only way to let them go away is to find out why they're here on earth and just do the opposite.

When Coyote Howls,"New Jersey, United States",Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: When Coyote Howls

D espite my paranormal experience as a kid, nothing else occurred until I was about twenty-five. I became a divorced mother of two young girls and took a job at El Coyote in Netcong, NJ. It's a bright pink building with a long history. Before Coyote, it was two restaurants. Club 21 and Nellie Burke's.

When I started working, no one ever mentioned anything to me about the strange things that would happen there. No one told me about the voices and the shadows and that when your hair stood straight up on your arms when you went downstairs was a common occurrence. I think they were waiting for me to tell them.

My very first experience was the knocking on the window. We had closed up for the night and I was going to meet other employees for an after work drink. I was the last one out, parked down in the back on the ramp. The kitchen was right above me. I unlocked the car and heard the pounding on the windows. I looked up, the kitchen was pitch black. I felt the hair on the back of my neck prickle and my hands shook with my keys. Three more hard raps on the window and I couldn't bring myself to look up again. I bee lined for the bar we were all meeting at.

When I arrived Brenda looked at me and asked if I was okay. Apparently, I was very pale and had a hard time describing what had just happened. When I told her and the others they just smiled and said ""Coyote ghost make contact?"". Of course I was intrigued. Scared, yet curious. I started talking to Bill the head bartender. There were many nights he stayed after closing and heard only noises in the beginning. He heard silverware jingling by table forty. He saw shadows moving through the dining area and would investigate finding no one. Soon after, he told me of the manifestation.

He was cleaning up, catching some t.v. when he heard the front door click. You can't see the front door from the bar but when people come in you can see their shadows on the one entry way wall because of the chandelier in the lobby. He walked to the lobby and found not a soul. He walked the dining room once, thinking they went inside but again it was darkness. He walked back toward the front door only to see the form of a man. He was middle-aged, wearing a white and black striped sweater with a closely cropped beard. He told me that upon seeing the dude, he screamed like a little girl! Big burly, biker Billy screamed. I had to laugh.

Sometimes, when I work, I hear my name being called. Easy enough in a place where you worked for the last thirteen years. But when no one really is calling you, that's when you feel it. Your customers don't want you, your co-workers didn't either, that's a freak out. It's not just me, it's all of us! The voice could be male or female and knows each and all of us because the staff has been there forever.

The poor bus kids won't go downstairs alone. My nephew (who I suspect may be gifted on his mom's side) has seen the same shadow I have, casually leaning in a doorway downstairs observing us getting supplies. He quit. Ouija's didn't help. I don't like tangling with them anyway. We decided to call in researchers. Ironically, before they came, the relatives of the previous owners came in. Lynn was their waitress and told her the craziest story.

Downstairs used to be a bar as well as the one upstairs. When her grandpa would close Nellie's he would call the cops at least twice a month, swearing there were people hiding downstairs. Bar stools could be heard moving around, bottles would clank but when the old man came down it would stop.

TSPR came in a few months later. Activity was low, but the second time they returned there was lots more. A few entities occupy the building. I urge you to visit tsprghosts.com Netcong, NJ . There's pictures, video and EVP readings that were not picked up the first time. Or you can google El Coyote, Netcong.

Unfortunately, our owner died. We all still work there though but the place has been so quiet. I keep urging the new owners for renovations to see if our 'friends' will contact us. We miss them but maybe they moved on. And if that means peace for them then that's cool with me.

"Old Stone Home in Fryeburg, Maine","Maine, United States",Ghost Tours & Haunted Hotels,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Ghost Tours & Haunted Hotels :: Old Stone Home in Fryeburg, Maine

W hile living in the state of Maine, my 2 sons and I headed up the road to look in an old apple orchard to shoot a deer. Outside the orchard was an old stone home. Across from it was a fallen down barn. The boys and I walked over the old barn. There was ""some"" snow on the ground, not a whole lot. As we got directly across from the driveway of the house - we could see the trees out back. Behind the trees was a large pond, something caught my eye in the side window of the house. It was a large woman in a apron, leaning on the table there and smiling at us. I told the boys we should go and ask her if it was alright to cut through her yard to go behind and into the orchard.

We walked across the street and knocked on the door, noticing immediately that there was no furniture in the house. I walked around to the side window. There was a old table there in front of the window, all dusty ""with NO hand marks"" where the woman had been leaning. Also, NO footprints around the house in the snow! We saw her for quite sometime before crossing the dirt road. She was there! But - not a real person at all...

She was a real ghost. We later learned that the house was empty because of this woman who had haunted it for many years. The house has been torn down, no one could ever live in it. It was in Fryeburg, Maine. There was a very - very haunted house near Bridgton, Maine, about 8 miles from this one. The owner offered $100 to anyone who could spend the night in it, no one ever did while I lived up there!

Things Flying Off,"Ohio, United States",Poltergeists / Physical Manifestations,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Poltergeists / Physical Manifestations :: Things Flying Off

M y mom was up late one night cleaning, she set a picture of my dad which died a few years ago on our home bar flat. Her 2 friends came over at some point that night and commented on the picture, they left and shortly after, while my mom was in the other room, the picture flew off the bar and hit the wall across the hallway. There was nothing there that was visible that could've even knocked it off the bar led alone throw it off the bar.

When I was a kid I use to play hide and go seek at my friend's house, we thought it would be scarier in the dark because we thought it was haunted. About 5 years later we found out it really was haunted, their mom asked old owners if they knew who lived there before they did and her name was susey. My friend has told me sometimes when he takes showers at night, the lights flicker only when he's in the shower. One time when my mom was over there, she was talking to my friends mom and a candle flew off the shelf and landed across the room, with no explanation why. About a month ago when I was over there, I was sitting in the next room and I looked over at my friend while he was letting the dogs out the back door and the light just went out and he wasn't near the switch. And seriously when they moved in, there was a built in swing on their front porch, they had it taken down and you can still somehow hear swinging like it's still there.

Demon in the Motel Room,"Oregon, United States",Old Hags / Night Attacks / Sleep Paralysis,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Old Hags / Night Attacks / Sleep Paralysis :: Demon in the Motel Room

L et me first tell you a little about myself. Through my entire life, I have always had encounters with demonic spirits. I have always been able to sense their presence, and am always the first to be attacked by them.

I was staying in a motel room on the coast with my family one night. I had a dream that I was in the motel room when all of a sudden an evil spirit appeared. It was about as tall as I was, (about 5 1/2 feet). I immediately recognized it as an evil spirit and began to rebuke it. When I confronted the spirit, it opened its mouth and let out a paralyzing scream. I was unable to move or speak, but could hear my spirit still yelling at it.

I began to fall backwards and when I fell back all the way, I woke up. At least I thought I was awake. It turns out I was still in my dream. The spirit again appeared and I again confronted it. It screamed, my spirit yelled at it, I fell backwards, and I woke up. (this time for real).

I thought it was just a bad dream and quickly fell asleep. This scenario repeated two more times before I was finally awake. I believe I was fighting the spirit which dwelt inside of the room while I was asleep.

When I was finally able to actually wake up, I woke my mom and explained what had happened to me. She got up, turned on the lights and spoke to the spirit. She told it that it could no longer stay and must leave.

The Rest of my Paranormal Experiences,"Ohio, United States",Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: The Rest of my Paranormal Experiences

I 've already posted two stories explaining my experiences and decided to post a final story. This one will describe everything else that has happened to me. This will be kind of long, but lots of strange things have happened in my house. This should be the final story that I will post (unless something else is yet to happen).

1.) When I was very young (about 5 or 6), my father and I were putting Christmas lights on the tree in our front yard. It was about 2-3 pm, my dad said, ""Look,"" and there was a white orb flying. It was about 30-40 feet in the air, and it flew north over my house. It was the size of a golf ball. It was moving in a curvy motion. A golf ball couldn't have staggered back and forth while flying through the air. In fact, the staggering motion was very agitated - almost like a splice between a zig-zag and a curve. It was also moving to slowly to be a flying object.

2.) One night when I was about 12, I was laying in bed (the top of a bunk bed) with a bundle of my blankets bunched up in my arms with my head resting on them. Just as I dozed off, I felt the bundle of blanket being pulled from me. When I opened my eyes, I swear I saw a head. I was scared to sleep in my room for a while.

3.) I already mentioned in my first posted story the scuffling of feet in my room, the object hitting my bed, someone dancing down the hallway, and the loud bang on my dresser. This next sub-story happened during the same time period as all of this (spring 2002). I came home from work and sat in my basement at a desk. I then heard an object hit a desk (a different desk) across the basement. It sounded exactly as if someone had dropped a pencil (there are several pencils on that desk) from about 3 inches off the desk. I know what a pencil hitting that desk sounds like because I've dropped several pencils there myself. I heard it bounce and roll as well. A different night, I came home from work and sat in my desk again (same scenario). This time, a tiny object (bird-seed sized) flew from across the basement, bounced off my desk, and landed on the complete other side of the basement. I heard it bounce all the way across the basement, and it flew extremely fast. It didn't fall, but flew parallel with the ground. I felt like someone purposefully threw it at me. This doesn't seem strange, but in concert with all of the other paranormal things that have already happened, it becomes something to wonder about.

4.) We had our dog put to sleep in November 2002. He had a very distinct howl (more like a scream) and would do it in pain from his tumors. During the next few days, each of us (the members of my house) heard his howl at least once apiece. One member of my family said that the howl he heard had come from inside the house and that it was very loud.

5.) Other minor things happened over the years that didn't really spark much interest in me until I grew up, experienced more serious occurrences, and realized that ghosts are in fact real. I remember once when my brother and I were wrestling in our bedroom, the large ceiling light suddenly turned on by itself. When we asked our parents, they were surprised, but my dad caught on and finally said that he just played a joke. I can tell he was lying because he initially seemed surprised when we asked him. I also remember cans falling off the basement shelf several times while my friends and I were hanging out. A bunch of them would fall at once. Another time, a lighter flew off my dresser while I was laying in bed. Moving on... A radio (with batteries) buried deep in a closet full of junk turned on by itself one night at about 3:00 A.M. Also, I've seen several flashes (like cameras) reflect off the basement wall while listening to headphones. They were behind a paneled partition wall so that I didn't see the flash, but only the reflection of it on the foundation wall. Finally, when I was about 7 or so, I woke up one morning and laid in bed just looking around the room before getting up. Then I saw a ball of light flash above my dresser in mid air. It was like a spark. I remember wondering about it for several days after.

6.) Other people informed me of strange things in my house too. Once, a friend told me that I had bats. When I asked him to elaborate, he told me that he saw a black ball flying around my basement in the rafters. Another friend of mine said that a light turned on by itself in the basement. A family member briefly saw someone in the basement mirror (the basement seems active- huh). Another family member saw a beautiful woman appear in her bedroom (strange).

Being my last story for you guys, I must say that it seems as if these 'ghosts' only come on certain nights. There will be no activity for months or years, but every once in a while, things will happen during one single night. As of right now, nothing strange has happened to me in about 3 years. I sleep with lights on now and always will.

The San Francisco Zodiac and a Witch Named Raven,"California, United States",Ghost Hunting,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Ghost Hunting :: The San Francisco Zodiac and a Witch Named Raven

T oday is a hot crispy day and there is a lot of things going on with H.P.I. (Haunted and Paranormal Investigations) of Northern California this day. Shannon ""Ms. Macabre"" McCabe - President of HPI and two seasoned investigators Tim Hawkins & Cherie Vincent would take about 30 new HPI investigators on the Guided Tour of Haunted Placerville, which includes seeing and touring: Hangman's Tree Bar; The Hillsider Saloon; Historic Cary House Hotel; The Cozmic Cafe- or Pearson's Soda Works w/their underground mining caves; Hidden Passages Bookstore; Tomei's Restaurant; The Druid Monument; The Sequoia House Restaurant and The Placerville Union Cemetery. I speak to Shannon more often on my cell phone, than I do with my own father. If you ever watched X-Files, Mulder and Scully were always in constant communication with each other on their cell phones and today would be a day that Shannon and I would talk a lot, for briefings on two separate investigations. Since I am HPI's Ghostwriter, I needed to know what was occurring on the Placerville investigation and keep Shannon abreast with my Lake Berryessa investigation. On this day, Saturday - August 4, 2007, the day started normal. I started grooming my Chow T-Rex, while my Jack Russell Terrier named Pika jumps into his small pool, rolls around in the dirt and tracks mud all over the kitchen floor. I yell in mock anger...""The next time Pika, you're going to the dog pound!"" Pika actually knows what the dog pound is. When he was younger, he ran away and got lost and was actually taken to the dog pound. When I found him at the dog pound, he was so excited to see me, he urinated all over me. I said to him...""you didn't like the dog pound?"" The word ""dog pound"" stuck. Of course now, I tease him and would have no intention of ever taking him to the dog pound, but it's comical to see his reaction. I know, I'm a meanie.

Let's get rolling on the investigations, I quickly meet up at a Starbucks off Watt Avenue to talk with Lyudmila Bernik, a Ukrainian native that now lives in Sacramento. We discussed a possible trip that I might be making to the Ukraine and Romania. Lyudmila has Romanian blood in her and I have always had a desire to visit Transylvania, the home of Vlad Tepes aka Dracula. We sat there and had a lengthy discussion about Dracula. I still have no idea where I am going on my vacation next year, but if the air flight is priced right, I might be headed for the Ukraine and Romania. Thanks for the tips Lyudmila. Now to my investigation at Lake Berryessa. I went and picked up a Wicca named Raven. Raven does not want to be fully identified in this article, but she is a unique individual. She looks superb in her all black outfit. She has a tattoo of a Raven on her arm and a skull/Wicca pentagram necklace draping her neck. Raven briefs me about Lake Berryessa. I know most of the story, but in case, you the reader doesn't know, here's what happened.

In September 27, 1969, college students Bryan Hartnell and Cecelia Shepherd had a picnic along the shore of Lake Berryessa. It was a relaxing afternoon. Cecelia noticed a man lingering in the shade of some trees nearby. Suddenly he appeared wearing an odd hooded costume that had a white crossed-circle stitched onto the front. The Zodiac held the frightened coeds at gunpoint as he explained that he intended to rob them and make his escape. Bryan and Cecilia were bound with clothesline. The victims hoped that the ordeal was about to end, when all of a sudden the Zodiac attacked them with a foot-long knife. When the vicious attack was over, the Zodiac walked away and left his victims in agony.

The Zodiac used a black marker to draw a large crossed-circle on the door of Bryan's car. Below his symbol, the killer listed the dates of the two shootings and added the notation, ""Sept 27 69 6:30 by knife..."" At 7:40 pm, the Napa County Police Department received a call that had been placed from a telephone booth located a few blocks away. Officer David Slaight listened as the caller said in a low, monotone voice, ""I want to report a murder - no, a double murder. They are two miles north of park headquarters. They were in a white Volkswagen Karman Ghia..."" Slaight asked the man to provide his location, but the voice only faded away and the caller replied, ""I'm the one who did it..."" When dusk arrived a local fisherman found the couple writhing in agony. Cecilia died, Bryan survived to give his account on the attack.

Raven took me to the area of the attack. The ghost of Cecilia is supposed to haunt this area and some witnesses have claimed their is residual haunting activity in which the murder plays out over and over again. As Raven and I waited for night to fall, I listened to Raven's involvement with the Wicca culture and how Wiccans respect all nature, plants and animals. They seek to live their lives in harmony with the Earth. Raven also explained to me how Wiccans have gotten a bad rap and many people misconstrue their activities as something evil. Raven embraces the night and she couldn't wait until the sun set. I made a call to Shannon. Shannon explains to me, that they are capturing some great digital photographs on their Placerville Haunted Tours. She relates to me that one of the investigators felt cold chills from the Pearson's Soda Works, near the mines. They caught many orbs in their photographs at Pearsons. More orbs photographs were taken at Empire Antiques. The orbs seems to be near the investigators as if they were watching them. Shannon gave a nice briefing about each haunted locale and told them the legend of Stan the Ghost that haunts the Cary House. In one photo, Shannon explains to me that an orb is captured at the stairwell. Could this be Stan the Ghost? All in all, Shannon said the tour was a success and she was pleased at all of the orb activity during this investigation. Shannon tells me to check out the HPI meetup site, to see all of the orb photos from this investigation. The next thing Shannon asks me is how I was doing. I explain this later to Shannon as night falls.

As I get off the phone with Shannon, I think of the orb photos she is referring to. I know my house is not haunted and I have taken over a 1000 digital photos at my home and have never captured an orb picture. When I go on an investigation to a haunted location, most of the time I get an orb picture by my 4th or 5th shot. Why is that? Sometimes people explain the orb photos as dust orbs...well, my house is dusty, I have two dogs for criminy sakes. How come I can't get dust orb photos with my camera in my own dusty house? There has got to be some kind of explanation for orb photos, I just don't know the answer. As night falls, it's extremely dark. At some point of time, I have a feeling of dread. I look for strange cars that may pull up to my car. Raven is not afraid of anything and embraces the night. She tells me that people say that they see orbs floating around this area at night, with their own eyes. As I look around I see a strange blurry light. I go to investigate and it's a rock. What I don't understand is why is this rock glowing from a distance? When I approach the rock, it stops glowing, as I walk away from the rock, it glows. Raven notices the glow from the rock too. This is not an orb, but it is strange for this rock to glow this way and from a distance it looks like an orb.

No EVPs were detected at this location, I did have the feeling of dread that came about me that lasted for about 5 minutes and went away. No orb photos were taken. The glowing rock did not come out in my photo, but it could be seen with the naked eye. This investigation was inconclusive as I later related the information back to Shannon. The place is extremely creepy and every star in the night sky could be seen. If continued reports come in, in regard to a residual haunting, another investigation will be conducted.

As I drove Raven home, we talked about how she got her nickname Raven. Of course, she adores Ravens, she's a witch for crying out loud! She asked if I had any nicknames. I told her that I had many nicknames in the past, but recently noticed that some of my friends now call me ""Paranormal Paul"", but that can't be any worse than when I was called ""Fresno County Paul"" by employees of the Governor's Office of Emergency Services. Raven looks at me confused and asks...""why did they call you Fresno County Paul?"" I told her that when I worked the Northridge Earthquake disaster, I met up with my ex-wife in Fresno. She came down from Sacramento, as I came up from Los Angeles, we met up half way. My colleagues at the time, teased me and said...""why don't you meet her at some place that is more fun, like Monterey... Why Fresno?"" They could not fathom the idea I would meet up with my ex at Fresno and before I knew it, I was being called ""Fresno County Paul"".

Raven looks at me and says...""you definitely have a crazy life!"" For more on HPI, check out their website at: www.hpiparanormal.net

The Whistling Wraith of Camellia Memorial Lawn,"California, United States",Ghost Hunting,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Ghost Hunting :: The Whistling Wraith of Camellia Memorial Lawn

O ne of the things that is fun about being a ghost hunter for H.P.I. (Haunted and Paranormal Investigations) of Northern California is that I am able to head out somewhere, meet a potential client and listen to their ghost story. This Sunday, August 5, 2007, I was doing exactly that. I went to the quaint town of Davis and stopped over at Konditorei Austrian Pastry Cafe and waited for my potential client. Her name is Laura (Jeanne) Garman, she likes to be called Jeanne. Jeanne has a very bubbly personality and full of smiles. As I ate my buttered croissant and drank my vanilla bean coffee, I listened to Jeanne's stories. Jeanne feels she may be an intuitive, she picks up on things that other people don't pick up on. It appears that the paranormal may have followed her throughout her years. Jeanne is a single mother of 3 children and when she lived in a home in Spokane, Washington in 1989, she knew the home was haunted by a small girl ghost. She would hear constant laughing or sobbing. The house was over 100 years old and carried with it, a lot of history. The sobbing and laughing of a little girl would continue, then one night she heard somebody climbing up and down the stairwell. She heard running footsteps. She cried out for her 8 year old daughter, thinking it might have been her daughter running up and down the stairs at this late hour in the night. When investigating, her daughter was sound asleep and there was no one around who could have caused the sound of running feet. Later on, Jeanne discovers buried correspondence, underneath some dirt, underneath the outdoor steps. As she went over the letters, she read on how two families were corresponding with each other and in the letters they were inquiring on the health of a little girl that had consumption (an old word for TB). She moved from Spokane to a home in Benicia. She moved into an old Colonial home. There was a cellar to the home and when she entered the cellar, she felt like something was dead in the cellar. It was an overwhelming feeling, she could not stay in the cellar to long. The cellar door would open by itself on a regular basis. One night she heard a woman's voice crying out to her...""Jeanne, Jeanne"". This was enough for Jeanne, she now lives in Davis and has not witnessed any paranormal activity in her new residence.

On this night paranormal investigator/scout Jennifer Baca came over and we set our goals in investigating three locations. First off, the East Lawn Elk Grove Mortuary off of East Stockton Blvd, Camellia Memorial Lawn at 10221 Jackson Road and finally the abandoned Ice Crystal Factory between 15th and 16th Street - on R Street. We brought along another ghost hunter, his name is Pika, a Jack Russell Terrier that belongs to me.

When we arrived at East Lawn Elk Grove Mortuary, we stopped by my mother's (Rose Marie Roberts) grave and I gave my respects. I also stopped over at my stepmother's parents (Mitchells) gravesite along with the Huft gravesite to give my respects. After my silent prayers, we started our ghost hunting. What is unusual about this cemetery is that there are turkeys wandering around the grounds and Pika had a field day chasing them. There was no unusual activity at this cemetery and we headed over to the Camellia Memorial Lawn. This is when things became strange. While we took photos and turned on our digital audio recorder, we started hearing voices and whistles.

In one location of the isolated cemetery, I heard a distinct man's whistle, he was whistling a tune, it lasted for no more than 5 seconds. Jennifer didn't hear the whistle. Jennifer and I, both heard a woman's laughter, then we both heard what sounded like two children talking. The closest homes were one mile away. There was wind. So, could have voices been carried for a mile to our location, where we could actually hear the voices as if they were no more than 20 to 50 feet away from us? The woman's laughter sounded like it was no more than 50 feet away and it was a loud laughter. The man's whistle, sounded like it was no more than 20 feet away, in the opposite direction of the two houses that were a mile down the road. Was this truly a whistling wraith? There was a point of time, that Pika seemed focus on an area near a tree as if he sensed something. I checked to see if there was any animals in the tree and there wasn't any, but he kept looking at one area of the tree as if there was something there that only he could see. He finally got distracted to chase a couple of rabbits and one cat. Another time, I heard two loud knocks on a tree and I cannot determine what caused the two knocks. This was a very strange cemetery.

Our last destination was the abandoned Ice Crystal Factory. I was told it was once a fruit packing plant, but the sign says Ice Crystal, so I am not sure. This factory has been abandoned since the 70s and I was told that 2 men that worked there, were killed by the factory machinery. The story I was told that the two factory workers were taunted by the other factory workers because of their deformities. One of them, that was nicknamed Charlie Crooked Teeth, had crooked teeth. The other factory worker nicknamed Jimmy One-Eye, had only one good eye. Charlie Crooked Teeth and Jimmy One-Eye became very close friends. I do not exactly know the kind of machinery they were both working with, but the story goes that an accident occurred and they were both killed by the machinery. Other stories said that they were set-up and the machinery was sabotaged, this lead to their deaths. Supposingly, Charlie Crooked Teeth and Jimmy One-Eye haunt this factory. As we took digital photographs, we got some interesting orb pictures. I took a picture in an opening of a window and got 13 orbs in one photo, the next shot, there was no orbs. Jennifer took a picture at the location where my car was parked at and got some orb shots near my car.

I would like to do a further investigation of the Ice Crystal Factory and Camellia Memorial Lawn, both places seem to have some exceptional activity. Could the restless spirits of Jimmy One-Eye and Charlie Crooked Teeth still haunt this abandoned factory? Are they trying to find why they died sudden deaths. Could they be the orbs that seemed to have followed Jennifer and I, around the factory and later seen by my car? If so, Jimmy One-Eye and Charlie Crooked Teeth, may you both rest in peace.

Belfast Orbs,Ireland,Photographs / Videos / EVP,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Photographs / Videos / EVP :: Belfast Orbs

I know, I know... Orb photos! Not always the best example of ghost photography, is it dust? Is it light? Or an apparition? Who knows. All I know is I recently went to Belfast and when I looked at the photos I took, all 7 of them, I found 3 interesting pictures. I'll give you a bit of background then my humble opinion.

I visited Belfast, Northern Ireland July this year as a birthday treat from my girlfriend. We stayed in a large hotel called 'Radisson SAS', which was built on the land of Belfast's old gasworks. If my memory serves correct, the gasworks was fully operational from 1893 until 1988. I haven't looked into the history of the Gasworks for no other reason than laziness! I would like to find out more, but we are planning to go back soon so I'll get some info straight from the source as it were.

When we arrived we somehow managed to get ourselves an upgrade to a business class room, which turned out to be a rather nice large room, with a massive bed. The bed was so big in fact, I made my girlfriend take a photo of me star like on it. I then took a picture of my girlfriend doing the same... don't worry we've got clothes on! I used my Samsung digital camera, which despite its love of batteries and all the power they contain, is a good little camera. I then took a couple of pictures of the room and another of my girlfriend standing by the bed. Not all the pictures came out due to the giant window and the sun coming in, but the 3 mentioned above have what appear to be orbs.

I've marked out what I think are orb-like shapes on all the pictures. The first picture is me on the bed (sorry for inflicting my ugly mug upon this lovely site!), I can see 2 full round shapes and a larger half-orb shape in the top right.

The second picture is my girlfriend on the bed. I've marked 5 shapes, but I'm not too sure about all of them. Although I do find the two over her chest quite funny!

The third picture is my girlfriend by the bed. I've marked 7 shapes that are questionable. The ones in the top left corner appear to be in a rather straight line, which makes me think it could be some kind of glare from the light. I should point out that in this picture the window is behind me, and in the ones of us on the bed, the window is on the right hand side of the picture.

So those are my pictures, what do you think? I've never had anything like this show up in any pictures before, and I must admit I was excited when I saw them. Although I did then kick myself for not actually checking them until 3 weeks after I got back! I'm not saying for definite that these are orbs, I would just like some other opinions. I've shown them to a couple of friends and got a response of 'ooooohhh'. But I did get a good response from someone whose opinion I valued, which gave me the courage to post them on here (you know who you are!).

P.S. In case it's puzzling you, Lian is a girl's name... Yes I'm a girl (although the photo is questionable!)... with a girlfriend.

Sister in the Mirror?,"Florida, United States",Apparitions / Voices / Touches,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Apparitions / Voices / Touches :: Sister in the Mirror?

I am 24 and am not a religious or spiritual person. I have lived in my house for over 10 years, and have never felt or experienced anything supernatural or felt anything strange in any of the rooms in my house, or anywhere else for that matter.

It was about 11AM and I had just stepped out of the shower, and had dried and dressed. It's the summer time so my siblings are not in school, and everyone sleeps in, so I just assume they are home. I opened the bathroom door and was looking in the mirror, messing with my hair, when I see the reflection of my sister run by from the kitchen to the dining room. She is 13 and is always trying to scare me. So thinking I now had the upper hand, I withdrew into the bathroom and closed the door. Waiting her out for about a minute until she got bored and gave herself up, but there's nothing, not a breath, footstep, or giggle. From around the corner I open the door and stick my hand out waving at her, knowing she is hiding in the dining room. Then I take the 4 steps that it takes to get to my room from the bathroom quickly never turning the corner to acknowledge that she is still hiding from me. I get to my room and lie there for a minute or two, and I call her phone.

In the background, I can hear her friends laughing, which is when I realize that she is not home. I feel sick, and my stomach is knotted up, and I already know the answer but I ask her if she is at home. She tells me that she hasn't been home since yesterday. I call everyone else in my family and ask if they are home or have been home. But I am the only one. Now I am not easily scared, but the fact is, I didn't think I saw a ghost, I thought it was my sister. Only after I found out that no one was home but me, did I get that sick feeling in my gut. I don't know what I saw in the mirror, but it was moving. And it had to be moving because I was standing still and saw it. I saw long black hair and brown clothing, but no face. The only thing I can think of is that there has been digging in front of my house, both construction and my mom is having a fountain/mini-pond put in in front of the house.

Could we have disturbed someone? Has anyone ever experienced anything similar to this? I would love to know. That's why I stumbled upon this site. Let me know guys, it feels horrible to be uneasy in your own home. Thanks.

Junior Girls Bathroom,United Kingdom,Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: Junior Girls Bathroom

H ere I am again with another one of my 100% true stories. I have just left my primary school, in other words year 6, and I am now going to secondary school after the six weeks holidays of course. Now my stories have happened at St.Bart's my old primary school in the junior girls bathroom.

There is a plaque in our hall and we (by we I mean me and my friends) have never really noticed it until things started to happen. Because if your ever alone in the girls bathroom you mostly all of the time can hear someone walking around, it's not my imagination because it has happened to my friends too.

Also this is weird because sometimes you go in there and the end cubicle door is locked, but no one's in there. Plus my friend was in there with her friend, it was just them two when her friend saw a hand come under the cubicle she asked it it was her friend, but her friend was also on the loo and it wasn't her, and they were positive no one else was in the bathroom at the time.

Another one of my friends was in there alone and she was washing her hands opposite the end cubicle, then she looked in the mirror and to her surprise a girl looked round the door and smirked at her! So she quickly dashed out the bathroom.

After we found out that all these instances had happened, we just had to check out the plaque in the hall turns out a girl had died in our school because it said ""whom we all loved"". So to see if it was true we did a seance and we asked if any one was there give us a sign show yourself, touch someone, turn on a tap. Amazingly, one of the taps turned on! We were in shock and rushed out the bathroom.

Luckily we don't go to that school any more, but I would really appreciate it if you could comment my story thank you love, the melon lover.

The Presence,"Georgia, United States",Old Hags / Night Attacks / Sleep Paralysis,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Old Hags / Night Attacks / Sleep Paralysis :: The Presence

I 've experienced many things in my life that many would consider paranormal. A fact about me is that I'm a Christian and very religious which, I believe, attributes to the reason why I have experienced such things. I've pondered these experiences for many years and am glad that I can now relate them to others without fearing ridicule or disbelief.

I am now nineteen years old now and this particular experience occurred when I was thirteen or fourteen. In my old apartment in east Athens, Georgia, I always had the feeling that something dwelt in this little apartment along with my family and I. It felt like something or someone was always watching me and I knew it wasn't benevolent because whenever I sensed it, I got the feeling that I should be very cautious of the presence.

Our apartment had three bedrooms upstairs. My brother's was almost directly across from the staircase, my mom and sister's was down the hall on the side of the staircase, and mine was at the end of the hall. My room was the worst because that's where the presence was most felt. At times I would be in my brother's room and would sense something come out of my room, stand at the door of my brother's room, and just stare at me. I never heard, saw, or smelled anything. It was just a strong SENSE of something there.

One night, my brother and I switched bedrooms and I was lying on the floor reading a book near the door. I guess I fell asleep there and a few hours later I awoke VERY suddenly. I realized that I had fallen asleep on the floor and was about to get up into the bed when I looked in the hallway towards my former room. I again sensed something sinister come out of the room and stop at my door.

Suddenly, (it's hard to explain even now) I became immobilized there on the floor. I couldn't move or speak and I felt a great pressure around my head while my vision became blurry. Actually, my vision was strange. Consider the television fuzz or static that shows when there's no reception of a channel. Well that's similar to how my vision was then. I could still see everything but it was like the fuzz was mixed in with it. Simultaneously, in my head it felt like two forces were fighting each other-fighting over me!

As I stated before, I'm a very religious person and suddenly I began to say Jesus in my head - it wasn't even a conscious decision - I just began to say it in my head! As I said Jesus! In my head, it felt like one of the forces was getting stronger and overpowering the other. Soon the stronger force - which I KNOW was Jesus - had completely overpowered the other force - the evil presence. At that moment the pressure left my head, my vision returned to normal, and I could move again.

I shot out of that bedroom and ran downstairs to watch television with the lights on! I thanked God all the way, too! I'm so glad we've moved but I don't think I'll ever forget that frightening experience.

Tanniq,Canada,Misc,"M y name is Pelagie Aggark, I grew up in a little town called Chesterfield Inlet, I'm about to tell you a story I heard from my dad who heard from my aunt (brother and sister). During winter many kids would be playing out in the snow (there's always a lot of snow in the north) my aunt was inside the house with my grandparents, all of her brother and sisters (my grandparents had thirteen or more kids) were playing outside or visiting some friend, she was looking for something to do so she went to check the rooms to see what she would play with when she saw my other aunt jumping on the bed.

She said in inuktittut ""You shouldn't jump on the bed or I'm going to tell mom and dad"" so she went to tell her parents, when she told them, they said marlene was playing outside but she denied it and said she was jumping on the bed, so my grandmother and aunt went to go check the room and there was no one there, they check all 5 rooms and there was no one in the house except them. Then marlene went inside the house with her winter outfit. When my aunt asked her if she was jumping on the bed in the room, Marlene said she was playing outside all day and didn't come in until now. So my aunt was a little scared but got over it.

Years later when I was 8, my parents, my brothers and sister( she was just little back then now she's 13) moved to my grandparents old house (same one). Not even a week later, I was about to go to sleep in my own room but I felt like I was being watched. I checked the door way and there was a little girl looking at me by the side of the door. I was scared out of my wits when she disappeared so I turned and said to myself ""I believe in ghosts, I believe in ghosts, I believe in ghosts"" (hahaha).

Next morning I told my parents and describe to them what she looked like, the thing is she looked like my little sister, they told me that was her tanniq (which means 'soul' even if she wasn't died) watching me and that I should be scared after that little encounter it didn't bother me or do anything.

I hope you enjoyed it, and sorry if doesn't make any sense I'm not really good with my english. Have a good day.

Our Creepy Little Culdesac,Canada,Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: Our Creepy Little Culdesac

M y room mates and I have just moved into a brand new place - and it's kind of funny, because I almost expected it to be just like my last place. Calm, no weird happenings, etc. The one thing about my last place was that it wasn't really ""homey"" and this place is, it feels like home - we've all settled quite nicely into our separate rooms.

There's two of us girls upstairs, and the two boys downstairs. The first night we spent there, our fourth guy room mate was in Ontario and had not moved any of his things inside. Mikey on the other hand has the bedroom right below mine (which is the master bedroom). I am a sound sleeper unless my cell phone rings, and then I wake up within seconds. The other girl and I were sound asleep passed out in my bed, we were both exhausted, and I had the television on to kind of drown out any background noise from outside (there's an alleyway just behind our backyard and the cars going past along the gravel is pretty loud and annoying when you're trying to fall asleep, well, it is for me anyhow). Mikey was apparently the last to fall asleep. Our floors are EXTREMELY creaky, but the only time they creak is when there's pressure put in certain areas.

The next morning we woke up - and decided (because we're exciting hilarious fun girls) to go wake Mike up. He was kind of laying there just dozing and then asked us what the heck we were up to in the middle of the night. ""It sounded like you two were creeping around up and down the hallways,"" we just looked at one another and disagreed with him. ""Dude, we were sleeping..."" Of course he didn't believe us at first, and then he sat up - ""You're telling me I... Dude, this house is haunted isn't it?"" We laughed it off.

We went out for a cigarette, the two of them were sitting in our side yard and I had forgotten my lighter. I went into my bedroom to grab it and behind me the door slammed shut. I immediately looked at the window... Not open. I looked at my fan, on - but on low, and pointing at the ground. I opened my bedroom door nice and slowly, propped it open with a giant stuffed yellow duck from my bed, and said ""please don't do that again..."" and went outside with a shocked look on my face.

I told the other two that my window was open, I don't need them freaking out just yet - and I hope nothing else happens. But I have a feeling that this isn't the end of it. My girlfriend who is living upstairs with me gets scared incredibly easily, and the last thing I need is for her to be crawling into bed with me having a bit of a freak out (because she does do that, and has been that way for the past 8 years, I'm like her big sister when it comes to her becoming paranoid about noises and what not) and Mikey and our other room mate are total skeptics. They'll laugh it off any day, but I think that creaking really got to Mike that night after realizing that we weren't awake at all. And there was no movement on the bed or near where the bed was, it was in the middle of my room and up and down the hallway. Geeeehhh...

I'll keep you posted. We just moved into this place last Wednesday, and so far these are the only two things that have happened. It's strangely comfortable there, like - I don't feel anything negative. I don't understand why my door would have slammed shut, though... There was no breeze, it was boiling hot - I had my window closed to keep the heat out, and my fan was definitely not on full blast - even if it was the thing looks like it was made in the 80's, it would probably fall apart.

Facing Your Fears,"California, United States",Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: Facing Your Fears

I submitted a story called Party gone wrong a while back and this is pretty well a follow to that. I was over at Cassie's house (where I spend most of my time) and her mom asked us to walk to the store, a short distance away, to pick up a few things for her. If we had taken the path by the old house we're so scared of it would have been maybe half a mile to walk, but we wouldn't walk past it.

We went a mile out of our way to keep distance between it and us. When we got back to her house her little brother told us that we should face our fears because we were the only two girls he knew that were scared of an old house. (We agreed that it was pathetic but it scared us THAT bad) Cassie and I told him we would go if he went with us to prove that we weren't crazy, so we went to the old house.

The minute we stepped in the feeling of being watched fell over me and Cassied gripped my arm. We heard someone walking around in the kitchen of the old house and I nearly turned and ran at that. Jason went into the kitchen and when he came back it was like someone was walking behind him. We could hear footsteps that were like someone wearing heavy boots. Cassie ran out of the house and I was right behind her and as soon as Jason heard what we heard, he was right on my heels. When we got onto the road we heard the sound of heavy boots again on the road behind us. (we were all wearing flip flops). Then we heard the sound of someone walking in the leaves beside us on the road.

When we got back to Cassie's it was dark and we locked the doors and satin the living room with her mom. (her dad was at work). The door knobs started shaking a lot and the windows were rattling. ""It followed you home!"" Mrs. Kell kept saying over and over. It finally stopped and we are even more scared than we were before. Now we're not allowed to go to the old house anymore. (Mrs. Kell banned that).

"Now You See It, Now You Don't","California, United States",Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: Now You See It, Now You Don't

W e moved into our townhouse in El Monte, California about four year ago. The townhouse is fairly new, not even 20 years old, although El Monte is one of the older communities in southern California. Late in the evening as I was lying in bed I'd hear footsteps running up and down the stairs, but I never thought much of it. We shared a common wall with one neighbor who had two younger children, so I just figured it was their son running up and down their stairs which shared the same wall as ours (the floor plans of the townhouses were mirror images of each other). Although it sure did sound like someone running up our stairs.

Now as probably happens in many houses the world over, items in our house would disappear, often when they'd been left in plain sight, like on the kitchen table or counter. We'd search high and low but not find them, but a couple of days later they'd be back; sometimes lying in plain sight, other times under a newspaper or a magazine, even though we were positive we'd looked there several times.

Last week my wife woke me around 2am when she came to bed. She asked me what I'd done with the book she'd been reading that afternoon when she took her nap. I told her I hadn't seen it when I came to bed, nevertheless I was forced to get out of bed and conduct a search for her book because she just has to read before going to sleep, even at 2am. The book was nowhere to be found and my wife reluctantly abandoned the search and climbed into bed.

Over the next few days, when it occurred to us, we'd look around for the book. I even lay down on the floor and looked under the bed and under our bedside tables. I did this a few times over several days. You know how it is. You've looked there already, but maybe, just maybe, it will be there this time.

Last night my wife excitedly showed me the book. She'd found it under her bedside table. Now the gap under our bedside tables is rather high, so anything lying under them should have been immediately apparent. And remember that several times I'd lain on the floor and been at the perfect level to see anything under the bedside tables.

Not only had the book been under my wife's bedside table, but she said it had been standing up on one end, not unlike when you have it on a bookshelf. Somehow over several days we had both failed to see the book, standing up under her bedside table, despite it being something we'd both been actively looking for.

That night around 2am I was woken by a tapping on my shoulder. I rolled to face my wife and asked her what was wrong. With her head buried in her book my wife did not reply. What did you want? I snapped at her, grumpy and annoyed at being woken in the middle of the night. My wife raised her head, puzzled, and asked what I meant.

Still annoyed, but possessing the enviable gift of being able to return to sleep at a moment's notice, I rolled over and was back to sleep within seconds.

Perhaps I imagined the touch on my shoulder, perhaps it was a remnant of a dream I couldn't remember, although it must have been a dream where I was awoken by a tap on my shoulder.

And how on earth could the book have stood up, under the bedside table, for an entire week, and not been seen by two people turning the house upside down looking for it. It wasn't the first item in our house to disappear and reappear days later, and I'm sure it won't be the last, either. Did we somehow overlook the obvious, unable to see the forest for the trees? Or had someone, or something, borrowed the book for a time?

Uncle Rocky part 2,Canada,Family / Friends Visits,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Family / Friends Visits :: Uncle Rocky part 2

P reviously I gave the background on my Brother-in-Law, Uncle Rocky , and some of the experiences we've had. Now I'd like to share some more. There aren't any scary tales to be told, really, except this one. I was home alone one day, reading and enjoying the quiet in the house. Suddenly there was this tremendous 'crack', it sounded like what I would imagine a gun shot would sound like. It scared me to death, my poor parrot screamed and fell right off his perch. Our city isn't as violent as some but the first thing I thought of was that our house had been shot.

I checked the windows for a hole or crack or anything odd, there was nothing. With heart pounding I went outside to see if the front or side of the house had been hit. I checked everything, deck, front door, siding, everywhere. There was absolutely nothing out of the ordinary. Nobody in the neighborhood seemed to be alarmed, nobody came running out, craning their necks the way people do. That was a one and only event.

We had things like the stereo volume adjusting itself up and down once in a while (this is a different stereo than the one from my other story). They weren't screams of sounds down to silence but just up and down by bits. Enough to notice.

We have a Red Bone Hound, Otis, who is the calmest, friendliest and laziest dog you could imagine. He's had a couple of experiences too. Once while he was walking into the living room he ran to the bottom of the stairs and, looking up the stairs, just started to bark, the hair on his back was standing up. There was no person up there. He just carried on barking for a couple of minutes while I tried to calm him down. Finally he just stopped and laid down in the living room with the rest of us, like nothing had happened. This exact same thing happened at the back door and at the patio door on 2 separate occasions. Both times he just stopped and carried on as if nothing had happened.

Both of my sons' have said that when they've been downstairs in the spare room, which was their game/play room, the door knob would rattle when they were in there early morning week-ends. They had to keep the door shut so they could sneak in really early and not wake us up.

We have a clock in our dining room that is way up high, about 9 feet up. It has one battery compartment to keep the clock running and a second battery compartment that gave the clock the special effect of having a different bird chirp on the hour. The battery for the chirping had died a long time ago and since it was so high and also very annoying we never bothered putting a new battery in, so it would keep time but not chirp. Months after the 'chirp' battery had died the clock suddenly gave out one chirp at about 3:15pm. That was the only time it ever did that.

I once had a dream, or maybe not a dream exactly, it was very detailed and so realistic. I woke up to find Rocky just walking into my bedroom. He was the Rocky from the funeral, sort of swollen and not quite himself. I knew who he was and felt no fear or anxiety. I knew he was a dead person I was talking to but it seemed the most natural thing to be doing, like there was nothing odd about things at all. I asked him how he was doing and realizing how silly that seemed, I asked how he was feeling about the way things were going. He laughed his usual laugh, kind of like I'm dead what do you think. We both knew what I meant and he said he was okay with things. I asked him if he was doing things around our house so we'd know he was around. He said yes, that he was. He didn't want us to forget about him. I remember asking him if he was going to stay around and continue doing things but I don't remember an answer. It seemed like we just sort of chatted about mundane things but nothing that I can specifically remember. I didn't feel any kind of threat or fear. The next day I remembered a lot about it and I was so tired, as if I'd been up half the night. Rocky was a pretty laid back person and he was really easy to talk to, that was just the feeling I had from things.

In July '04, we had a battery operated clock in the kitchen, different from the bird clock in the dining room, and it had run out of batteries and had not been working for about a week. My husband's Mom, and of course Rocky's Mom as well, dropped over for a visit and just happened to mention that our clock was stopped. We just told her we'd get to it sometime. The next day the clock was running again and at the right time. In my journal, I've written that of August 2nd it was still running perfectly. I didn't record in a date that we did eventually have to change the battery.

Also in July, I was watching TV and noticed that someone had left the upstairs hall light on. This annoyed me because since nobody was up there it was a waste of hydro. I thought when a commercial came on I'd get up and turn it off. A couple of minutes later the light went out. My first thought was the darn bulb had burned out. After about 10 or 15 minutes later the light came back on. There was no one near the fixture or the switch.

In October '04, we had a huge electrical storm and our power was out for a good while. It was night and pretty spooky. The winds were really strong that night. I rushed around lighting candles in the living room so we could have some light. I decided to look out in the back yard to see how our trees were holding up during the high winds. Since it was so dark, I couldn't tell. What I did see was a greenish ribbon, a light with a trailing tail, not like a streak because it was sort of a gentle arcing motion that was moving back and forth and sort of up and down across the back of our back yard. I didn't see how it could be from the neighbor's yard because our fence is 6 feet high and only has small spaces between the boards. I figured if it was from the neighbor's yard, I'd be seeing it as more of a blinking or flashing type of light. It was just a smooth motion and it lasted for maybe 30 seconds, possibly a minute and then it just stopped. I watched for a few more minutes but there was nothing more.

I have recorded in my journal that as of April 28,'05 things had really settled down. I was still seeing motion out of the corner of my eye, sometimes a dark shape in daytime and sometimes a lighter shape in the evenings. Sometimes the impression of a silhouette in the doorway out of the corner of my eye but it's never there when I look directly at it. Sometimes it seems like a shadow passing the doorway. On more than one occasion I've thought I heard my husband come in the back door into the kitchen and gone to greet him only to find that no one is there.

I know this is really long and not very dramatic. No glowing eyes, thrown dishes or scary people following me around. These are just some of the things that have happened and I think it shows that it doesn't have to be horrifying or frightening to have a haunting. This is a lot to take in at once and I hope I haven't bored anyone. I've tried to get across the things that have happened.

I have a lot more to write about Uncle Rocky and someday soon I will, just for the people who may be interested. Thank you for taking the time to read my story and letting me share some of my experiences with you.

Hideous White Face,United Kingdom,Apparitions / Voices / Touches,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Apparitions / Voices / Touches :: Hideous White Face

Y ou might not believe the story but I promise you that it is real. It started when I went to my nan's for a week while my mom and dad went on holiday. I was just getting into bed when I heard a strange tapping sound at my window. I'm 11 and I get scared really easy so I wasn't sure whether I should go to the window or not, but the tapping didn't stop so I got up from the bed and slowly walked to the window. I drew back the curtain and there was a hideous white face staring back at me. I fell backwards and shouted out for my nan. She came in and asked me what was wrong. I told her that there is a face at the window, my nan told me that there was no one there and to go to sleep. So I slept on the floor in my nan and granddad's room because I didn't want to be in the room on my own.

The last night at my nan and granddad's, my nan told me that I should go and sleep in my room because I could damage my back if I kept sleeping on the floor so my nan shut the window and drew the curtains for me. I went to sleep and woke up at about 2 o'clock in the morning. I was sweating so I got up and went to get a drink. I heard some one coming into the kitchen and I said is that you nan, of course, when no one answered me, I got very frightened and went over to switch the light on, a man stood there looking at me and he had the same face as the man who was looking at me through the window! I shouted for my granddad and he came running into the living room, of course, as soon as I had shouted for my granddad, the man had disappeared. I didn't go to sleep for the rest of that night but sat in the living room watching the t.v with all the lights on.

The next morning my mom came to pick me up and my nan told her about my week and my mom took me home and asked me to explain it. I told her and she said that she wouldn't make me sleep at my nan's anymore if I didn't want to.

Who was that man and why was I the only one that he wanted to see him? Please leave a comment and help me to explain this. Thanks lydia07.

Sleep Walking or Possession?,Bahamas,Misc,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Misc :: Sleep Walking or Possession?

Y ou might think this is really weird but I assure you it's true. It all started when I went on holiday to the Bahamas. I went to bed the first night I was there and all I of a sudden I dreamt that I was in the jungle and tigers were chasing me. I would wake up in the back garden of our villa lay under a tree.

Then I had dreams that I was out side cutting the rose bushes when I would be strangled and I would wake up in a sweat with red finger marks on my neck. I sleep with my fiancee but he says he hasn't heard anything and I'm probably sleep walking, I told him that even if I was sleep walking, how did I get the finger marks all over my neck?

Some nights I never sleep in case I move in my sleep or get strangled again. I read a story once that said if you die in your dreams you die in real life, that's why I'm afraid of going to sleep. On the way back to England, I fell asleep on the plane and I woke up leaning on the sink in the plane toilets. I asked my fiancee what had happened and he said I told him that I was going to the toilet.

When I got back to England I got married and when I was at the altar I passed out. When I woke up I was in the toilets of the hall that we had booked for the after party. I came out and my husband said that I had said I do and that we had just arrived at the hall and I told him I was going to the toilet.

2 weeks after our honeymoon when the dreams had carried on, I went to a psychologist and he told me that I was being taken over by a ghost for minutes even hours at a time! The strange dreams keep happening but I just hope that one day they will go away.

Voices from Another Century,"Georgia, United States",Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: Voices from Another Century

W hen I was a child, we lived in a most unusual haunted house. Built on the log cabin style, but larger, more like the Ponderosa, the house was at least a hundred years old. The upstairs and downstairs had been converted into separate apartments. We lived downstairs while an elderly lady, Ms. O'Kelly, lived upstairs... The house was situated on the outskirts of Atlanta on several acres, nestled away from the main roads where traffic flowed. Although electricity, running water and other modern conveniences had been added, even as a toddler I recognized the vestiges of a by-gone era. Rusty plows and other farm implements lay idle on overgrown fields. Ashen sheds, barns and other outbuildings still housed the remnants of harnesses, plows, pitchforks and other tools for farming, hunting and trapping. What remained of the flexible two handled saws they used were only the half eaten blades that time had devoured. Broken cast iron pots and shards of pottery lay half buried under the earth alongside the large lye vat which had been used for making soap. A dirt lane meandered around the premises into the woods where small dilapidated houses stood crumbling. Only one was occupied by a strange man, a bit of a recluse, as was Ms. O'Kelly, disappearing into the medley of strange sounds and people that was the backdrop of an already haunted world I had been born into.

In my youth, I never understood they were ghosts, not real people like Ms. O'Kelly or the man that lived in the woods... Let me explain. It was not a case where only one specially sensitive individual or clairaudient could hear the sounds. Everyone heard them. Our ghosts were toilers that worked from sun-up to sun-down. The matriarch of the family that we dubbed ""Granny"" was not that old by today's standards judging from her labor. She was the first and the last to rise and go to bed, playing out the same drama endlessly that began with the morning wake-up call. Granny ascended the stairs, clapped her hands and barked at the men, presumably her sons and husband, ""Git ap! Git ap!"" Most of what they said sounded like gibberish and the accent was strange. The thud of feet could be heard hitting the floor as well as their descent down the stairs. Granny could be heard in the kitchen clacking the dishes and silverware as she prepared the morning meal. The men always exited through the side door in the kitchen to harness the snorting horses with chains to continue plowing the fields.

Other sounds emanated from the house; the thump-thumping of Granny churning butter in the kitchen and later the rhythmic foot tapping on the floor of what we imagined to be a spinning wheel. Though no one ever saw a visual manifestation, to my knowledge, they had very definite roles that were easily recognized. The buck-board wagons creaked as the wheels turned and drowned out with distance... Later returning with louder sounds as they approached the house. Throughout the day the sounds of hammering, sawing and other work related noises could be heard. Upon entering a room, the noise would suddenly stop only to start back up again the minute you left. If you entered their work area outside, the noises would also cease temporarily only to resume as soon as you left. For that reason, I assumed they were real people that were just around the corner, in another room, outside or on or about the premises working.

At about this time, my grandmother became seriously ill and we began spending weekends away from home. Upon returning, Ms. O'Kelly said there was a ""whole gang of them downstairs just jibber-jabbering away..."" Our household ghosts had company with all the noises associated with a get together of family and friends. No one could understand them, except for the morning wake up call of, ""Git ap, git ap!"" That was close enough to, ""Get up, get up,"" and with the accompanying sounds, there was no mistaking those words. Ms. O'Kelly said when we weren't there, they'd ""carry on"" all night and she didn't think she'd ever get any sleep and was always glad when we came back.

I asked my mother what she did when we first moved in and discovered the place was haunted to which she calmly replied, ""Oh, we knew it was haunted when we moved in. The Wilsons had lived there before us and they told us about it, but they said the ghosts wouldn't hurt you..."" Her only complaint had been that she thought she'd never get any sleep amidst the incessant noises that would often go on all night.

Other strange events she recalled, one that I vaguely recall, were the lanterns that floated through the woods at night at about the same level they would be if a human held them. She didn't know what to make of the events at the time, but in later years my family and I had many discussions regarding the ghostly manifestations. My mother and I decided to go in search of the haunted scape after some forty years. As we were driving there, I asked her if she thought they were still there to which she said, ""Oh, no, you know as soon as they tore the house down they all left..."" Interestingly, though I had been a child when I last lived there, as we neared the locale, I felt it and exclaimed to my mother, ""We're close! I can feel it!"" She responded, ""So can I!"" Though a mall and newer homes had been constructed at the site, something of the energy remained. We heard nothing nor did we see anything out of the ordinary, but there at ground zero we could still feel their presence.

Our Creepy House - Bathroom Incident,Canada,Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: Our Creepy House - Bathroom Incident

M y room mate (girl) just called me about twenty minutes ago to tell me about an experience she had in the shower not even over an hour ago. I submitted a previous story to detail a few things that have started happening at our new place entitled Our Creepy Culdesac . So, as I've figured, there's quite a bit of activity in my bedroom, right outside of my bedroom and in the upstairs bathroom. Right now, anyhow - we don't hang out much in the basement together, and it only seems to be happening to us girls. The boys wouldn't notice anything anyway, except if they were on their own.

So my room mate was in the shower not too long ago, hot water, bathroom steaming - and all of a sudden, even though the water was still running hot on her body she felt a sudden freezing of the bathroom. She told me that she was actually shivering, she was so cold - despite the fact that there was still steam in the bathroom and the water was running hot. She's the only one in the house right now, and she's pretty freaked out (hence why she called me at work). She's on her way out now, trying to forget about the incident.

Has something like this ever happened to any of you before? Gah. I was hoping that things wouldn't escalate, but now they seem to seeing as we've started noticing it. I have a hard time showing fear when things like this happen, as it's kind of exciting, and for once - things are occurring without a ouija board. Like I said in some of my previous entries here I refuse to use one.

We have a storage closet at the bottom of the stairs in the basement, and the place gives my room mate upstairs with me the willies. She refuses to go in there at all. I've been inside, storing stuff, haven't felt anything or felt weird being inside of there. I suppose she could just be paranoid about small dark places, but either way - I'm starting to get a little freaked out.

La Llorona,"New York, United States",Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: La Llorona

H i, my name is Michelle, I'm a mother of four children but when this happened, I only had two, my oldest was five and my youngest was just a baby. When my second child was about four months old, we lived in a trailer park across the street from an open field in Sodus Point, NY. It was supposedly a battlefield in the war of 1812. One night, around midnight, he woke up crying, I heard someone or something singing or rather chanting to him, it sounded so weird. I couldn't understand her, but she kept singing until he went back to sleep. This proceeded to happen every time he woke up in the middle of the night up until the night before we moved.

Needless to say he slept with me every night, I was really scared that something would happen to him. I never figured out what it was. Some people tell me it was the ghost of a slave and other people say it might have been the ghost of a nurse, and yet other people said it could be a ghost called la llorona. She threw her children into the water and drowned them and was condemned to walk the earth until she finds her children. She supposedly steals babies in the night trying to make up for the children she murdered. It still scares me. So what do you think can anybody help me on this one? Let me know please!

USS Blue,"California, United States",Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: USS Blue

W hile stationed at OXNARD, CA - on the Naval Station there, I had the opportunity to go aboard several ships that were being de-commissioned and taken to sea to be sunk by missile tests. Along with two other swabbies. We all headed over to the area where the Ships were tied. We went aboard the group there. The ship in the middle was an old WW2 Destroyer named BLUE. USS BLUE was tied up alongside several other TIN CANS waiting to be hauled out and sunk. Porterfield was another. Sort of sad. I was on them to ""acquire"" a few items. One was the Executive Officers Safe from his Stateroom. It was a very - very hot day. And down in the guts of a dead ship -- it can get very - very hot. Over 100 degrees...

We were all in the Officers Quarters area of the Ship (USS BLUE) when one of the guys picked up a Chinese coin from the deck after we had helped him move out the standing drawer unit there. Also, finding some WW2 Cigarettes and a ""temporary"" commission for an officer during the Vietnam Crapola...

We were all sweating - so darn hot. When all of a sudden - there was a movement of air. Then so cold we all got the goose bumps. Thinking something was strange - we moved into another part of the ship. HOT - HOT... One of the guys said let's go back in there! So - we all did. And again. VERY - VERY cold. And some strange sounds. Like a whisper. We left! Went over to another ship. And - HOT - HOT. No cold spots at all. One of the guys said he had felt something touch him shortly after picking up the Chinese coin. No doubt - Something was there, trying to get a point across. Since it was a WW2 Ship, I am thinking either someone was killed aboard her - or maybe it was the coin ? I'll never know - USS BLUE is at the bottom of the Pacific Ocean now.

Entity Laying Next to Me,Australia,Apparitions / Voices / Touches,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Apparitions / Voices / Touches :: Entity Laying Next to Me

I recently had read a story in a trashy magazine while in a hair dressers that sounded so much like I had experienced that I decided to write here now, thinking I may not have dreamt it and that someone else has experienced a very similar situation (but can I say I started writing this story last night while I was in bed and every time I tried to submit it, it just wouldn't work and I ended up losing the whole story which scared me a bit, you'll see why later as you read on).

My husband was working interstate, so me and my dog had the whole queen size bed to ourselves (the dog in her own bed next to me on the floor). It was probably early in the morning - as I have a pretty good ritual of waking up around any time between 1 and 3am - to feel what appeared to be warmth next to my skin as well as the feeling of body hair. I initially thought that my husband must have come home and snuck into bed, but I then thought that there was no way as he wasn't due home and the dog would have arose to any sounds as well as the fact my husband would definitely have woken me up to say ""Hello"". With this thought I reached over next to me to feel absolutely nothing not even warm sheets. I partially sat up looked around in the dark to see nothing in the shadows of clock radio light and I also checked my dog who appeared to be sound asleep in a tight ball in her bed. I pulled the quilt up over my head to suddenly feel hands wrap around my waist and pull me down into the bed.

I then woke up! I was cold and shaken and really didn't think it was a dream. I again felt next to me and the dog and as before everything was fine. I then again pulled up the quilt over my head and waited for myself to fall back asleep.

I don't know what it was. I do get feelings and psychic sensitivities but have never tried to work with these so called ""powers"". I will one day get the courage to check them out as I do have some pretty graphic dreams but I really feel this wasn't a dream as it really upset me.

The house I live in has been there for over 10 years with a few owners before, we have been there 4 years now and although I have had a few strange happenings I don't think its haunted!

Green Apparition,"California, United States",Apparitions / Voices / Touches,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Apparitions / Voices / Touches :: Green Apparition

T his took place when I was about 9 or 10 years old at my (at the time) closest friend, Yani's house. We went to school together and neither of us to my knowledge had ever seen or heard anything that might be considered a ghost (or any other paranormal entity). I was staying the night there and we has just recently gone to bed for the night. I was laying on the floor while my friend was in his bed.

I hadn't fallen asleep and I heard my friend say ""look look!"" I usually sleep on my side so I turned over and saw a vaguely humanoid, semi-transparent, green figure just hovering in front of the door. It almost seemed like it had the consistency of an egg white in that I could only partially see through it to the door. I also recall that the center of the being looked more solid, then became more transparent around the parameter of its form. I was pretty freaked out and I remember Yani saying ""do you see it?"" I could tell he was scared as was I. The green figure didn't make any sound but just floated there, sort of moving in place. I don't remember what I said to Yani or what I did then, but I'm pretty sure that I covered my head with the blanket. His mother didn't seem like she believed us when we told her but the experience was pretty vivid.

It's been many years since that happened and I'm no longer in contact with Yani so it's tough to put down all of the details about it now.

"The Haunting of Abigail, Aged 6","Minnesota, United States",Poltergeists / Physical Manifestations,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Poltergeists / Physical Manifestations :: The Haunting of Abigail, Aged 6

A s a young adult I lived in house with seven adults and one little girl, Abigail. When I first moved in, the house seemed cheerful and warm. The eight of us would gather round the table to play cards and relive the day's events. Abigail basked in the attention of so many adoring grown ups. I thought of her as my own little doll baby, often holding her in my lap and tickling her chubby little knees. She had long straight blond hair, like corn silk, and deep soulful eyes. She did not speak much, which I thought odd, since most little girls are chatter boxes. She simply listened and observed the adults around her. Her little hands were constantly gripping someone's skirt or pant leg. She seemed to crave the security of touching another person. She even refused to close the bathroom door when she used the toilet. I lived there for weeks before I realized that the little girl simply could not stand to be left alone.

I spoke with her older brother, Henry, about her clinginess. He explained to me that she had suffered some unspeakable abuses at the hands of an older brother. This child did not live in the house and had been sent away to live with the estranged father. I kept this knowledge to myself and tried to be more aware of her subtle pleas for attention and reassurance.

Henry and I began spending more and more time together after that. He needed to speak with someone about the terrible family secrets. He spent many nights in my room talking to me and seeking a confidant. He had been Abigail's only ally when she began talking about what went on in the bathroom with the middle brother. He had watched her behavior change over the months this abuse had occurred. She was angry and threw violent tantrums. She had broken a window in her bedroom during one of these rages. She had thrown a piece of child sized furniture through the window pane. He said that often he was frightened of her when she was enraged. Eventually he confessed that he believed her because he knew that his brother had been abused by their father, as had he. He feared he too would become an abuser, because he had been abused. He said that after scores of visits with many family counselors and child psychologists, their mother had been made to see the truth. It tore the family apart. She had taken Abigail and Henry and left. She was forced to file a restraining order on the middle child, to keep him away from Abigail.

As our relationship began to grow beyond the constraints of a platonic friendship, we spent more and more time together. Admittedly, both of us were guilty of giving one another more attention than we should have in front of Abigail. Her big hungry eyes gathered up each lingering look, hugs that lasted a bit too long, and hands that did not pull away when they happened to touch. She began to wedge herself between us. Often she turned her back on me entirely and tried to regain all of Henry's attentions.

Weeks wore on and the late night talks eventually led to a few occasions where we fell asleep on my bed together. Abigail, who never ventured down the stairs to the basement, would be waiting at the top of the stairs with a furrowed brow and reproachful looks in the morning. We let her fits of jealousy pass without comment.

One afternoon, I came home from work to find I had the house all to myself. Abigail was at pre-school, her mother was at work and everyone else in the house had miraculously vanished for the afternoon. I grabbed a bottle of beer from the fridge and went down to my room. The cold gray cinder block wall needed me to complete the mural I had been working on. I turned on my stereo and set my bottle of beer on one of the speakers. I sat it precisely in the middle of the speaker. (I am compulsive about some things, especially about things being centered and balanced.)

I opened the can of black paint I had been using to outline with and went to work on my project. A few minutes later, I crossed the room and sat down on the bed to get perspective of my work. I heard the front door open as Abigail and her mom came in. The beer bottle, just visible in my peripheral vision, hit the floor with a loud crash. It landed almost three feet in front of the speaker. I sat for a moment, shocked into stillness. My mind raced for a logical explanation.

I tried to convince myself that it had been the vibration from the door closing, or the throbbing of the bass coming through the speaker. Of course, neither of those things would have caused it to land so far away from the speaker. I crossed the room, turned off the stereo and cleaned up the mess in stony silence. My ears were piqued and my nerves were tingling as I gathered up my paint and brushes and crossed the basement to the laundry room. I tugged at the bit of string and the bare light bulb threw a circle of sickly yellow light into the room. I hated having my back to the door as I rinsed out the brushes in the wash sink, but I forced myself to act nonchalant. Someone had once told me that showing a person or thing fear gives it more power. I tried not to show any concern at all. The tiny hairs on the back of my neck stood on end. I felt like I was being watched. A sense of sheer cold malice seemed to be focused on my back. I closed the can of paint and put it away on the shelf in the laundry room and pulled the string again. The gloom and darkness washed over me. I admit that I made my way up the stairs faster than usual.

I waited for Henry to come home from work. I took him by the hand and led him down the stairs and showed him the scene of the crime. There was still a wet spot on the rug when there beer had soaked in a little. He thought I was playing tricks. I insisted he stay in my room with me that night. He sat with me and talked while I continued to work on the mural. When I grew tired of painting, I took my supplies to the wash sink in the laundry room and cleaned up. I put the lid on the can of black paint and put it on a shelf above the washing machine. Henry and I dozed off sometime after midnight.

I was awakened in the wee morning hours by Henry. He was dreaming. His forehead was beaded with sweat and he called out in his sleep. He fought with the bed sheets and sat up in the bed. He was sleepwalking! I wasn't sure what to do, so I followed him, to make sure he was safe. He made his way up the dark stairs and down the halls to Abigail's bedroom. He stood in the doorway a moment and then made his way back to bed again. He did not stir again that night. When he woke in the morning, his lips and tongue were coated in black paint! When he woke up he swore he had dreamed of Abigail painting his face.

The next night Henry had to work and overnight shift. The house was empty save for Abigail, myself, and Lauren. Lauren also had a room downstairs in the basement. We put Abigail to bed and shortly after we made our way down to our rooms. I shut out the light and leapt into my bed. Fear of the dark and the monster over the bed had seized hold of me. I lay in the bed, with the blankets pulled up to my chin, my eyes wide open, scanning the darkness. The blankets slowly began to creep down. I thought I was falling asleep, that my excited mind was playing tricks, so I snatched the covers back up to my chin and settled in. I chastised myself for being foolish. The covers began to creep down again. I reached out to tug them back up when they were suddenly whipped off the bed.

I jumped out of bed and crashed into Lauren as we both fought to get upstairs. We reached the doorway at top and both of us tried to turn the doorknob. We were a jumble of fingers and stifled squeals as we wrestled the door open. We both sprinted down the hall and threw Abigail's door open. The little darling was fast asleep, but her blankets were on the floor. Lauren and I left her door open and settled onto the couch in the living room. We both recounted similar stories regarding our bed covers. She confessed that she had been hearing things downstairs, but had convinced herself that it was just Henry and I having our whispered little conversations. I tried to agree that seemed a likely explanation. Of course, neither of us could explain our bed clothes being ripped off of us. We decided to sleep on the couch until someone else came home to stay upstairs with Abigail.

The next day Lauren and I went together to the Catholic Church and filled bottles with holy water. We spent the day in discussion and planning. We were certain someone or something else was living in the house with us. During the course of the day we concocted a plan to commune with the spirits with a Ouija board. If things got out of hand, we would soak the entire basement in holy water and palm fronds. We waited until Abigail had left with her mother and the rest of our roommates were at work. We felt safest in the living room, so we settled there.

We set out the Ouija board. We discarded the plastic planchette and used a heavy shot glass form the cabinet instead. We lit candles and laid our bottles of holy water and palm fronds within arm's reach. We closed the door to the basement. We double checked - rattling the doorknob and pushing on the door, to make certain it was closed.

We placed our fingertips on the shot glass and began asking questions. They were simple and direct. We asked ""Is there someone in the house with us?"" Seconds crawled by and turned into painfully quiet minutes. ""Is there someTHING in the house with us?"" Again, the glass stood still on the board. We began to relax a bit; perhaps we were even beginning to feel a bit silly. ""Maybe we imagined the whole thing"" Lauren offered. The glass moved then, it was a sudden, abrupt and quick movement to the word NO on the board. The basement door slowly opened. We heard a murmuring, as if there were people having a hushed conversation in the basement. We pulled our hands away from the glass and jumped to our feet, leaving the board to fall to the floor. We grabbed the bottles of holy water and advanced to toward the basement door, holding hands and holding our breath. The door slammed shut before we got there.

A light flashed through the kitchen window. A car pulled into the driveway. Abigail and her mom were home. I packed up my things and left that weekend.

Having the benefit of years and mileage between myself and these events, I am now prone to believe that all these incidents were manifestations of the emotions Abigail was dealing with. A child of only 6, who had been abused by an older brother, witnessed the devastation of her family collapsing as a result of this and felt threatened by me stealing the affections of her protector, might be generating enough psychic energy to upset things in the physical world. Then again, maybe not...

Shadow Men,"Minnesota, United States",Children Who See Spirits,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Children Who See Spirits :: Shadow Men

M y son is now eleven years old. He has never slept through the night unless he was sick. Not once. Not as an infant, not as a toddler, and now not as a young adolescent. He often has behavior problems in school, because he lacks focus and is prone to daydreaming and being cranky. He refuses to sleep in even a semi-dark room.

He has told me that the ""Shadow Men"" keep him awake. I tried not to be dismissive when he told me. I tried to assure him that he was in charge and should tell them to be quiet and go play someplace else. Shortly after this I gave him a flashlight to keep with him in bed and told him to shine that light right at them if they wouldn't go away when he told them to. Almost immediately after that he went through a phase of ""night terrors"". His nightmares were so frightful he was wetting the bed. He would insist that I lay in his bed with him until he fell asleep, most nights.

Now, as he is approaching his teenage years, things seem to be getting better. He still won't sleep in a dark room and has a lot of trouble falling asleep in what would be considered a normal amount of time. It's typical for it to take two or more hours for him to fall asleep. (Yes, I've monitored his sugar intake, adjusted his diet, even tried macrobiotic to cut out all chemicals and sugars!) Something is keeping him awake at night.

I am inclined to believe that the shadow people are to blame. I had similar experiences as a child. In fact, from time to time, I still sleep with the lights on. I need to learn to tune this out and I need to teach my son. Bad energy has got to go!

The Black Figure,"Montana, United States",Apparitions / Voices / Touches,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Apparitions / Voices / Touches :: The Black Figure

I live in a beautiful little house, every one I know thinks of it as a doll house. It's located in a nice neighborhood, or so I thought. Two nights ago I was putting my little girl to bed, I went to my room and was laying down. looking out the opened window. I just got relaxed when I was startled. I opened my eyes and saw a black figure jogging down the street. I could see him running but there were no sounds of shoes hitting the pavement. I didn't think much of it because I was already half asleep.

The next night I was at my mom's house watching a movie. It was getting kind of late, so I was walking home, as I walked down the alley, the same black figure from the night before walked out in front of me. I was frozen scared. I rushed in to my house and shut the door. After an hour of trying to put my daughter to bed, I went to bed myself.

I was awaken by an ice cold wind. I opened my eyes, my room was empty, I looked out the opening of the window and saw the same black figure standing there in front of me. I was scared and was afraid to look away and then in a split second, it vanished. I haven't seen the black figure since.

I don't know why but I find myself looking for it late at night.

Ghost Boy Running into Little Autistic Girl's Room,"Texas, United States",Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: Ghost Boy Running into Little Autistic Girl's Room

I am Cheryl, 36 years old and my husband I am moved into our 6 year old home in Feb 2007. The home set on a high hill on and pretty rocky area. Since we have moved here, we have seen and heard several things. As the real ghost story goes, I will have my aunt to tell you what she saw, and then I will tell you what I saw.

I was visiting my niece and her three children. I brought my grand-daughter over so we could have a play date with her little cousins on 8-7-2007.

We were going swimming this day so we were trying to get kids ready to go, there was two boys ages 2 and 4 and two girls ages 3 years old. This was about 3:00 pm when it happened.

I had just gotten my bathing suit on in the 4 year old's bedroom used as a guest room at times. There are 4 bedrooms upstairs and I was in the first room and there are two more bedrooms on this side of the hall way which are the kids rooms, the parents room is on the opposite side on the hallway with a bathroom at the end of the hallway.

So as the story goes I walked out of the little 4 years olds room and looked down the hallway toward the bathroom, and a little boy ran fast from the parents room into the little girls room, which is almost straight across which is about a 12 foot steps apart. So I took off down the hallway thinking ""Oh that's just the little 2 year old boy running around"", so I was going to go get him and tell him to get out of his sister's room. When I walked into the room, no one was in there and the closet door was open. I was like WHAT? So I then turned around and yelled for my niece Cheryl ""are you in here?"", I just stood at her doorway wondering if she was in her bedroom because I saw the light on in her bathroom, but she was not there. So I proceeded downstairs scared to death, when I was walking downstairs I could see all the kids were down there playing. I counted them in fright.

My niece was just at the end of the stairwell talking to the kids. She looked up at me and said ""WHAT'S WRONG did you see a ghost?"" and I asked her, ""Why did you say that?"" She told me, ""because I can see you look like you did!"" I told her ""YES I DID"", and I started crying, and I told her ""it, it was a little boy!"" I told her I thought it was Nick, and she said, ""no, he has been sitting at the table eating an apple for a while and has not been upstairs!"". I just kept telling her it was a little boy, and all the kids are here and no one is up there and the little boy had ran across the hallway. My niece looked very content as she was looking at me and she said, she has always sensed something was going on. So I took her up stairs and re-enacted to her what I saw and where it happened. We then took off paranoid out of the house to go swimming.

After my Aunt told me this, I really believed her. She looked so scared and had no reason to not believe her otherwise because we were going to have a fun day, and looking forward to getting out with the kids. I told her that things have been going on in this house since we have moved here. I told her that no one would believe us or take things seriously because usually when someone moves into a home they always wonder if it is haunted as a general idea...

Over the past few months though, several things added up: Like one night all the kids and husband were sleeping and a storm kept me up and after the storm passed, I had went downstairs to watch tv. While watching tv, the bathroom door in the living room opened up all by itself. I knew that one of the kids was messing around so I got up and no one was there, and all the kids were sleeping up stairs. I didn't just hear it, I SAW IT OPEN, but the couch was in the way where I didn't see the bottom the door, just the top, I was sitting on the loveseat... weird!

Then one night, when I was staying up late watching TV, I heard banging noises like someone was throwing toys around up stairs, directly above the living room up in the playroom, so I got up and went up there to get onto the kids, this was about 11:30 pm, but all of the kids were sound asleep. I was like what? Someone was playing in there, but don't know what it was... Another night the same thing had happened and I just ignored it and I was too scared to check it out.

One day, about 4 weeks ago our house alarm went off, for no reason and it was not even set to be on. You have to push number code to set it to be on. The electricity did not go off either. At the time, I was on the computer, and all the doors were still locked downstairs. Too weird again!

Just today, at about 1:30pm while my kids were in their rooms laying down taking naps, I heard awful noises in my little girls room, I was on the phone at the time, so I got off, what I heard sounded like someone ripping off the mini blinds from the windows in her room and it sounded like they were banging against the glass, and then I heard a huge boom as if a big dresser had fallen over. I ran up stairs right away to see if my little girl was messing with something and she was sitting on her bed with a book open, it was a children's bible book and she was looking at it. I saw the mini blinds were tore up a little bit and I asked her what is going on in here and she said I don't know...

Ok, I wander if this has anything to do with my little girl, she is a high functioning autistic child. I have read about demons trying to latch onto autistic children because they are so emotional. I think we will hang a cross in here bedrooms and buy her a cross to wear.

My daughter wakes up frequently at night and is crying and moaning, the day it happen my little girl could not sleep well that night and had woke up about 4 times screaming, I could hear someone jumping around in her room.

What does anyone else think... My aunt Sandy says we live on a high hill and this is where indians lived years ago and maybe it's an indian child's spirit, she says they burned their dead on high hills. I don't know...

Cold Chill Accident,"Indiana, United States",Misc,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Misc :: Cold Chill Accident

A bout 2 years ago, my grandfather took my cousin Josh and I deer spotting out in the country. We sat on the backseat windows and he drove. We weren't having a lot of luck because of the corn all over the place in which the deer hid. We drove for about 5 miles and ended up out in the middle of nowhere, on a dark country road surrounded on both sides by huge cornfields not far from the cemetery.

We were driving really slowly, and our grandpa had the spotlight out looking into the corn and surrounding tree lines. The moon was huge and deep red. It was the middle of summer and really hot out. As we were driving it got really really became cold ,almost freezing for a few seconds, and then the temperature went back to normal. Two minutes later we witnessed a car accident as it happened. No one was hurt or anything, but the front end of one car and the side of another were pretty smashed up. My cousin and I were really FREAKED. We weren't sure if it was something or someone trying to warn us or just a freak accident. I remembered reading somewhere that cold spots were signs of ghost activity. Nothing like this has happened since, but we still wonder to this day what the cold spot was and what it could've meant.

Mommy Dearest,"California, United States",Family / Friends Visits,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Family / Friends Visits :: Mommy Dearest

I 'm first going to start off by saying this is not exactly a ghost story. I have have always heard whispers of some kind since I was maybe around 4 or 5. I come from, well, let's just say, a troubled childhood. I have never known my biological mother. I know about her and my father has always told me about her when I was little. But I was later to find out, after moving in with my grandparents when I was 11, that there had always been a question to how she died. Weather she overdosed on purpose, or weather the man she was with then... murdered her. I don't really know anything but after I find these things out I began to realize I have always had these problems with what happened.

I hadn't find out that she was dead until I was 11, she had died when I was 4. Not to long after I moved in with my grandparents and started hearing whispers again. I was freaked out. But after I thought about it, I just closed my eyes and wished it away. I hadn't experienced anything since, then a couple years later, I remember I had just turned 13, I was walking down the hall towards the hall door. It was closed and when I went to open it, it wouldn't open. I didn't think anything of it, the door knob often got jammed. But then it seemed like there was a force on the other side pulling so I couldn't open it, then I heard my name whispered and I screamed. My grandma came and I started crying.

I was totally freaked out so I had my two dogs come in my room and sleep with me. My dogs know not to get on top of my bed but they did anyway. My room is the front room that has two windows that overlook the front yard and across the street, which is a coldy sac, I guess you could call it, and the houses. There is a house directly across the street and they wouldn't stop barking at it. Finally I got them off my bed, and they would just lay on the floor whining. I didn't know what was wrong, it had to do with that house but as far as I had known, that house was abandonned. I scolded them and got into bed.

I had just dozed off when I heard a scream, and I was sure it had come from across the street, from the house they were barking at. I started crying and went into my grandparents bedroom, my grandpa asked me what was wrong, but I just kept crying.

My dad later told me when I was just a baby, the three of us used to live in the house before he took me away from her. We owned the house but there was too many bad memories, so eventually he was going to sell it but he didn't know how. I was scared. I had never felt so scared in my life. I am now 15. I haven't heard anything since.

I really don't really know what went on that night. Maybe it was just my imagination. Or me trying to deal with the fact my mom was really dead. Or was my mom trying to tell me something? I don't know.

This Is Fun,"California, United States",Family / Friends Visits,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Family / Friends Visits :: This Is Fun

M y friend's mother became ill. Her mother was elderly and though her sad family gathered around her, they were not shocked. She slipped into a unconsciousness, but the family obeyed her wishes not to be taken to the hospital. My friend was heart-broken seeing her mother in such a state, and her mind slipped back to many years before when her brother was a young man. He had become preoccupied with death, and this became an intense desire to discover what happened after death. He was not mentally well and this obsession overcame him and he committed suicide to the devastation of all.

My friend snapped back to the present as her mother began to shift in the bed in which she laid. Everyone's murmurings became hoots as her mother opened her eyes and smiled at all those she loved who surrounded her. Her mother's clear blue eyes looked deeply into her daughters and she said gleefully, ""Darling, this is fun!"" Then her inhaling became short and her exhaling became long and rattling and she seemed to alternate between concentrating hard and then looking at the faces of those she loved.

Then she became still, and she passed on. Everyone began to cry and hold each other. Some pressing their faces on their old mama's hand as they wept. She remembered a pledge her brother had made before he died. He said that if there was an 'after-life' that he would give a signal, so that they knew.

As this thought flew by, she cried deeply thinking about her mother's suffering, then the door bell rang. They answered the door, but no one was there. Less than a moment after the door was closed the door bell rang two more times. And no one was there. ""It must be mom telling us she made it ok..."" The phone rang then and she answered it. No one could be heard on the line.

And despite her pain, my friend smiled at her mother care even after death.

The Night Visitor,"Ohio, United States",Family / Friends Visits,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Family / Friends Visits :: The Night Visitor

W hen I was a kid, I overheard my mother and aunt talking about seeing ghosts and other strange phenomenon they had experienced. At first, I didn't really understand it, but as the years went by, I began to sense things whether it be a flash out of the corner of my eye, hearing footsteps on the porch, or seeing my two-year-old daughter talking to ""a woman in a long black dress with lots of buttons"" that wasn't there. But nothing prepared me for what happened when my father-in-law, Dean, suddenly suffered a heart attack at his home in Piedmont, Ohio in 1981.

Dean's wife, four sons, daughter and their families couldn't see the world without this vibrant man, always the life of the party, always telling jokes, always pulling pranks and just being plain ornery. He made each of us feel special. My husband, Denny, the oldest son, desperately wanted to spend time with his father in the hospital. Unfortunately, he had a bad cold and couldn't see his Dad for a week. When I followed Denny into his hospital room, Dean greeted us with jokes about the cute nurses. Maybe he would be alright, I thought.

I didn't look at Dean as I sat down in the chair at the foot of the bed. It was only after I looked up did I see the purple cross on his forehead. I sat transfixed staring at it while he laughed and talked to Denny. Suddenly, this irrepressible feeling of grief engulfed me. I knew he was going to die. I could no longer hold back the tears and lowered my eyes. When I finally looked up again, it was gone.

The next few days passed quickly and the rest of family watched as Dean got better. There was even talk of him coming home from the hospital. Then it happened. The fatal heart attack hit Dean around 2 A.M. On a cold January night. I got the call before Denny got home from his afternoon shift at the local coal company. I hated to tell him the awful news and I watched as the color drained out of his face while he got ready to go to the hospital with his family. I stayed home with our 4-month-old daughter, Faith, and asked myself over and over - why me? Why did I have to know?

But I knew the answer to that question. I felt guilty for not being able to share what I knew with my husband and his family, but they didn't believe in that sort of thing. Then the unexpected happened again. One evening, after the funeral, around 9 P.M., Denny said he was going up to bed. As I sat in the chair watching television holding Faith, I saw something out of the corner of my eye. When I turned my head, I saw Dean, wearing his familiar plaid short-sleeved shirt, standing at the foot of the stairs in the other room.

I stared and for a minute my heart burst with joy - he's back! But I knew better and grief washed over me in waves. As quickly as the grief came a tremendous feeling of peace took its place. I felt no fear at all. He stood with his hand on the banister and smiled at me. Then in my head, I heard him say, ""I'm just going to say good-bye..."" Then he started to walk up the stairs and out of sight. I sat there for a good while unable to move holding my daughter close to my heart. I could feel love all around me.

Time seemed to stop for a while. When I finally got up, I put Faith to bed and went to check on Denny. He looked so peaceful. After I came back down stairs, I sat down in the chair, trying to make sense of what had just happened. I kept looking in the other room at the stairs, hoping to see him again. I never did.

Twenty years later, I once again experienced an unexplained phenomenon. My mother and I received word from the hospital that my father had suffered a debilitating stroke that morning in February 2001. We rushed to the hospital to find Dad unresponsive and dying. As we sat in silence, heads lowered in prayer beside him, he suddenly sat up in bed, holding out his arms, as if reaching for someone. His eyes reflected the sheer joy of seeing someone he longed to see. At that moment I wished I could see who it was. Then he began calling my dead brother's name, Tim.

I knew he had come to take Dad to heaven. He would suffer no more. I told Dad to lie down and as quickly as it happened, it was over. Mom said she heard me tell him to lie down, but wondered what I was talking about. She didn't see it, but she felt strange none the less.

""I believe you, honey,"" Mom said sadly. ""I just wish I could have seen Tim, too...""

Invisible Rain,"California, United States",Misc,"T his took place about 6 years ago when I lived with my mom and stepfather. We stayed in two story house and my bedroom was downstairs while the other bedrooms, living room, and kitchen were all upstairs. The backyard bordered a canyon and there was a lot of trees and brush.

When this particular incident took place it was about 10pm on a Friday night and two friends and I were in my bedroom getting ready to go out to a club. We had not been drinking or anything of the such. My parents had already gone to bed but I heard voices upstairs as we were getting ready to leave so I went up to check. My stepfather was comforting my mother and she looked terrified. They said that she woke up with the worst feeling of dread and sadness that she'd ever felt as if something terrible had or was about to happen. My mother has never been one to make things up and she could not have faked the horrible look in her eyes.

We decided to look around outback when my mother said she felt like something or someone was there. By this time my friends (Craig and Israel) had come up to see what was going on. We got a flashlight and one of those big spotlight flashlights and scanned the backyard for any sign of animals, people, or anything else. We did this from behind the closed sliding glass door since we didn't really know what was out there. We didn't see anything and it was a clear night so Craig, Israel and I went out to the back porch and looked some more. I had the large spotlight and I looked through the bushes and the porch itself and even straight up to the sky thinking I might see birds or something. Nothing.

We concurred that there was nothing there and then it started drizzling rain. I remember saying ""that figures"" but then it occurred to me that it was a clear night. I looked up at the sky again but didn't see any drops. I started to get nervous and used the spotlight to look up but there was no rain coming down, yet I felt it pattering on my face and arms. I looked very carefully but could only feel the rain. I asked Israel ""do you see that"" never mentioning rain and he looked for a few seconds then his eyes got real big and he said ""there's no rain!"" He clearly felt it too. We ran inside the house immediately and locked the door. We both confirmed that we'd experienced the same thing and decided to not investigate any further outside.

We never could find any explanation for the occurrence as there weren't any sprinklers within reach of where we were at. The sky was clear and even if there were, we couldn't see the drops with flashlights.

A Black Robed Shadow,New Zealand,Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: A Black Robed Shadow

I work in security in New Zealand. Our security company got a job to provide overnight security during the construction of a retirement home. About 5 different security guards who work for the company and that have been assigned to the retirement village overnight have reported seeing a black shadow appearing and disappearing, including myself.

We were discussing this last night and were trying to best describe what it looked like and what was the closest description we could come up with to describe this shadow. The best definition we could come up with was that it was the dark shadow, which looked human like, but was dressed in a black robe. The closest thing we could relate it to was that it looked like the Grim Reaper, except with no sickle.

Most of the time, the dark shadow just stands there, watching us. Sometimes we see it move and run before it disappears. One of the security Guards freaked out when it saw it standing on the roof of one of the portacoms just standing there staring at him. He could smell a weird burning flesh type smell. When the dark shadow saw him looking at it - it disappeared.

On the same night, when the security guard went to do his patrols, he found a radio turned up really loud on the construction site. No one had been there all night so he didn't know who turned it on. He turned it off.

About an hour later he came back to do the patrol again and found it on again. So this time he turned it off and pulled out the power cord. When he did this another radio down the hall turned on - about 20 meters away. He went and switched this one off as well. He did a search of the whole place but could find no one. He was freaking out.

A different security Guard said he had seen the same black shadow appear and disappear. Later on in the night, he was sitting in his car, and had closed his eyes for about 15 seconds when he heard a loud knocking sound on the windows of his car. He quickly opened his eyes and looked to see who it was but there was no one around. He freaked out because no one person could physically knock on the window and run away in the matter of 2 seconds, without being seen.

My question is, does anybody know what this dark shadowed, Grim reaper looking thing is? Has anybody else experienced something like this?

My Husband's Dead Grandmother and the Hag,"Georgia, United States",Family / Friends Visits,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Family / Friends Visits :: My Husband's Dead Grandmother and the Hag

D o you believe in ghosts and hags? Well my husband does. Although I do believe in ghosts, I don't know about ""hags"". But my husband is a firm believer after his experience. You may have read my other stories involving encounters after my grandfather died and my son's ghost story . Well this story involves my husband. My story about my grandfather , if you read, involved the fact that his spirit lived on for a short time after his passing, even though I personally never saw him, but there were a lot of things that had happened that only could have been him. In my son's ghost story, you may have remembered that my son had an encounter with a picture of his grandfather that was on his wall several years after his grandfather passed away. Although neither my son nor I have actually come face to face with any apparitions.

Well, the same does not hold true for my husband. As he, my son and I love to watch horror movies, only me and my son love reading each other scary stories. When I try to read the stories to my son or get on this site, my husband will get annoyed with me and roll his eyes at me because he knows how me and my son's imaginations get the best of us and then my husband suffers!

Well, one time after such a night, my husband looks at me with all sincerity after my son left the room and he said ""you know I saw my grandmother after she died"", I said, ""what, are you serious?"" and he said when he was 12 years old he was lying in bed before daybreak and about to rise for school and it was still dark in his room. He said something had awakened him. His bed was facing the wall so he had turned over thinking it was his mom coming into his room to wake him up. As he turned around, there in his opened area closet space he saw a white glow. As he adjusted his eyes, he could then clearly see this face ""staring"" down at him. He then realized that it was his dead grandmother. He said she was just glowing and staring at him, but only her face was clear, the rest of her was just a white glow. He said he thought nobody would believe him so he only ever told his mom and me. He said his grandmother had died only 4 months before this happened.

Afterward, I said to him ""have you had any other experiences"" and he said that when he was around 10 years old, he had lived in a small house with his parents and younger brother and he and his brother's bedroom was just off the kitchen. Well he said his brother's bed was against the wall but his was kind of facing the kitchen and his bedroom door was opened. He said how this had always scared him as the kitchen was dark to look at. Well, one night he couldn't sleep and was laying there in his bed looking out the door, when he thought he saw something. As he looked closer, he saw an old woman's face coming closer and closer in the dark with long dark stringy hair and red eyes. He said he looked again because he couldn't believe it and sure enough, it was coming closer and his first thought was to get up and jump in bed with his brother. I said ""well why didn't you scream for you parents or scream out loud,"" and he said because he had always heard about the ""HAG"" and he heard that if you were touching another person when she appeared then she couldn't get you. And he firmly believed that's what he saw that night. He's 33 now, but he's so sincere in telling his story.

He said that these were the only two experience's that he had. But they were enough for me. It's one thing to have unexplained encounters but to actually be face to face, well that's something else.

Just wondering if anybody else out there has experienced the HAG, and what that experience involved. Please comment!

A Few Experiences of my Own,United Kingdom,Misc,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Misc :: A Few Experiences of my Own

I have read most of the stories on this web site and even though my experiences are not as scary as them, I thought I would submit them anyway. Let me know what you think?

1) My first ever encounter, I was about 22 years old and lived with my parents in South Harrow, Middlesex (UK). My sister and I used to share a room, as the room was only small we had bunk beds, I slept on the bottom and my sister on the top. One night as usual we got into bed, the light went off and I cuddled up under the duvet, I must have laid there for about 5 minutes with my eyes closed, willing sleep, when I felt something in the room. I opened my eyes and at the bottom of my bed was a figure of a man squatting at the end of my bed (the top bunk was really low so you couldn't sit up), well as you can imagine I threw the cover over my head and pushed my hand up to hit the above mattress to wake my sister, when she asked what was wrong, a looked over the duvet while telling her what I had seen and the man had gone. I didn't sleep well after that!

2) My second was when I had moved out and was lodging with my friend and her 5 year old boy in Pinner, Middlesex. It was a small 2 bedroom flat on the third floor, there was always something really weird about the hallway in the flat, you would see things (shadows) from the corner of your eye moving down the hall. A few times I had been woken up by 3 short knocks on my door and when I would open it there would be no one on the other side, thinking that it was the my friends, I rang up the hall to the living room only to find that they were out. I told my friend about this and her mum freaked me out by saying when you hear 3 knocks on your door someone close to you is going to die, but she did say that it was three long knocks and what I heard was more raps. We used to smell a certain aftershave every now and again also, when we had no men living in the flat.

3) My third and final encounter was when I was living in Pinner, I was laying on my bed with my back to the room, facing the window, when suddenly I got a smell of my auntie's aroma, (my auntie died of cancer when I was 18 years old, also she was from scotland) I felt her presence behind me, I didn't dare turn around, and I said very quickly out loud ""please leave"" and she left the room and I haven't felt her since, sometimes I wish I'd turned around and not said what I said, maybe she wanted to speak to me or tell me something, or as she was very psychic when she was alive and saw plenty of spirits, good and bad, perhaps she was telling me there was an after life after all!

I got told last summer when I went to a wedding in Scotland by my cousin that I have someone watching over me to guide me and that I have special gifts I haven't yet learnt to use!

Mill Haunting,"New Hampshire, United States",Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: Mill Haunting

M y husband works as a maintenance manager in an old mill building. The building was constructed in 1890. It has had many uses over the years from the textile industry to the production of fire engines and rifles. It is currently an educational facility. Just the age of the building makes it interesting but if you add the history, it is even more so. My husband had told me from the beginning that the building was haunted. Stories abound from others that work in the building.

The first experience my husband had was hearing the laughter of small girls. This was according to him at about 3am on a Monday morning. The building was empty except for my husband. He was in covering for a janitor that was on vacation. He was on the third floor of the building and was feeling uncomfortable for some reason. He had cleaned a set of bathrooms and was making his way to the nearby offices when he heard a giggle. He said his blood ran cold and he just stopped where he was. He paused and listened but heard nothing. He started to move again and once again he heard laughter. This time there were two distinct voices laughing. Both sounding like small children. At this point he decided to go to another part of the building until the sun came up.

Later that morning he returned to the area that seemed so frightening a short time earlier. Now in the warm early morning light it wasn't scary at all. He did notice that there were pictures along the wall near where he had heard the laughter. Two of these pictures caught his eye. The pictures, each 8x10 showed sister in victorian dress. While they were adults, the coincidence sent a shiver down his spine.

The next week when the janitor he was covering for returned to work, my husband asked if he had ever heard anything while working up there. ""You mean my girls?"" was the reply. The janitor said the building was really creepy at night but that nothing bad ever happened, so he didn't worry about it. He said that along with the laughter of little girls, there were certain doors that would slam even though they were already closed. Also there were seats in the auditorium which he would always find down, even though they should spring back like theater seats. It was always the same seats and it didn't matter if the room was used at all during the previous day or not. He showed me the seats and to this day I will find them down in the morning.

On and off over the years he has had to work third shift for different reasons. Each time he does there is an experience. He has himself heard doors he recently closed slam shut. He has heard muffled conversations only to find the area empty when he investigates. He has also discussed this with other employees and anyone who has spent time in the building alone off hours has something to share.

The first time I was with him at night when the building was empty we experienced something together. He had stopped because I needed to go to the bathroom and we were nearby so it was ideal. He also wanted to check an office for a leak as it was a rainy evening and he had had problems earlier with the space. We were inside this particular lab and while it was dry, there was something more upsetting going on. We stood in the space and he checked for a leak, we turned to leave and he paused. I followed his gaze to the bottom of the door. We could plainly see shadows moving outside the door by looking at the gap between the door and the floor. It wasn't just one or two, it was nearly constant. As if an large group of people were walking by. It subsided in just a few moments. We walked outside the lab and checked the entire floor. We were alone. We checked each floor and found no one else in the building, the parking lot was empty too.

Since then, nearly each time we are alone in the building we have some strange encounter. I will post more as time allows.

Evil Entity,Canada,Misc,"T his story is about my aunt Marlene, I remember it like it was yesterday. During winter my parents, my brothers and me were at home in the evening, my mom was cleaning, my brother, my dad and myself were watching a show on t.v (don't remember what) until my aunt Marlene came in the house crying, without any winter coat or boots. She was carrying a picture of Jesus with her.

My dad and my mom rushed to her and asked what happened to her, my brothers and me were looking at her scared and confused. She told my parents in innuktitut that she was attacked by something when she was shutting the light for the night to go to sleep. When she shut all the lights off like she used to, something grabbed her (and I must tell you there was no one in the house, absolutely no one in the house but her) and dragged her into the kitchen while she was trying to wrestle herself out of the entity's hold.

When her and the entity reached the kitchen, whatever it is that was holding my aunt captive took a bottle of my aunts medication that was on top of the refrigerator and tried to force her to swallow every one of the medicine. She was able to set herself free from the entity, took a picture of Jesus and run to my parents house without any winter outfit (I forgot to mention that we live close to her). My mom called my grandparent and told them what had happened to Marlene while my dad tried to calm her down from her encounter. My aunt was sent to the health center because she said that she swallowed some of the medicine while she was screaming.

Some people lived in the house that my aunt lived in, but not many has lived there for close to a year. I finally heard a story that someone had committed suicide in the house that my aunt and many others that lived in there long before. A couple years ago, I heard from one of my cousin that the house is now boarded and shut for good, but somehow some teenagers would go in and see how long they can last in the house, and I can tell you this that they wouldn't last for 5-15 minutes.

That's my story for today, right now my whole body is kind of numb from typing this whole thing. There still a lot about my families' encounter that I like to tell you about in the near future. I hope you enjoyed this story as much as I didn't really like to type it (too scary and yet interesting).

The Old Mill,"New Hampshire, United States",Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: The Old Mill

I was working an overnight shift in an old textile mill. The mill was 117 years old. I had to stay overnight to keep an eye on a leaky water main where it entered the building. By 11pm the building was empty. I made a quick tour of the building just to satisfy myself that I was alone. Security had gone through before me and when they left they told me I was alone in the building as well. It was about 11:30pm when I returned to my post to watch the pipe leak slowly. There wasn't much to do in the small space so I started to read a book.

It was about 12:30am when I heard a muffled conversation outside the space I was in. I got up and stuck my head out of the room and looked down the hallway but there was no one there. I sat back down and picked up my book and I heard it again. This time I walked out of the office and up and down the hall. I checked each room and found no one else there. Now this is a 3 story building and I only checked the first floor, the floor I was on. I sat back down and read for a little while longer. I needed to stretch so I took a walk.

I went to the third floor and walked the main corridor. Everything was quiet. Same thing on the second floor. I looked out the windows and saw my vehicle was the only one in the lot.

It was about and hour later and I had made my tour of the building and heated up a dinner. I was sitting in the space with the leaky pipe eating dinner when I heard the muffled voices again. I ignored it this time and eventually they either faded away or I tuned them out. I sat there and read for about an hour after I ate with no other noises.

At 3am I got up to go to the bathroom. I walked down the corridor passing 4 offices before getting to the bathroom. All was quiet and dark inside the offices. I did my business and washed my hands and walked out of the bathroom. I noticed the office nearest me now had a small desk lamp on. I didn't see anyone in the office so I stuck my head outside to see if a car was here. There were none. I went back inside and looked around. I called out a couple of times but got no answer. I mustered up some courage and entered the locked office where the desk lamp was shining. I looked around and there didn't seem to be anything out of place. I shut off the light and backed out of the room. I pulled the door tight and backed away.

Just as I left the corridor and entered the space with the leaky pipe I heard a door slam. I may have made a noise myself, may have let out a startled scream but I am not sure. I looked back out, down the corridor and I saw nothing. I was pretty well freaked out but I managed to walk down the hallway. When I got to the last office near the bathrooms I noticed that the desk lamp was back on. I didn't bother turning it off again. I went back to my space and sat listening. I couldn't even concentrate enough to read. I just sat and listened. The voices would come and go. Sometimes nearly loud enough to make out the conversation but never quite. As the sun rose and the light made it's way inside the building the voices ended.

The first shift worker arrived just before 6am and I couldn't wait to get out of there. It was just too creepy for me.

Where Did You Get that God-awful Tie?,"Maryland, United States",Family / Friends Visits,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Family / Friends Visits :: Where Did You Get that God-awful Tie?

I worked for years as a professional psychic and ghost encounters is just one of the themes I dealt with. I've heard many stories, not just from my clients, but other individuals that tell stories of how a deceased love one comes to get their dying loved one. The following story is so sweet and tender, I thought the readers here would enjoy it.

Valerie and Barry were very much in love and planned to be married; a second time around for both of them. They were looking forward to beginning a new life together. Barry's mom was bedridden with a terminal illness that left her unable to speak or voice her needs. Valerie and Barry took turns sitting by her bed for awhile in the evenings to read to her. They knew that even though she couldn't respond verbally or physically, that there was something inside of her that registered the loving support they gave her. She had once been an active community leader and her children benefited from her persistence and loving care.

They were heart broken to see her now frail frame ravaged with disease. She could no longer focus her gaze and stared emptily into space. They had lived together for over three years and were ready to make it official, but because of ""Ma"", had postponed their wedding several times. Friends and other relatives assured them that they would take good care of her while they honey-mooned in the Caribbean aboard a cruise ship. No one knew how long ""Ma"" would live and she was already in her eighties. Everyone joked about her outliving all of them as the family history was one of a long lived people. Her father had lived to be 95 and her mother 93 which they attributed to their involvement in the community; staying active and maintaining a sense of humor. They had been active up until their deaths of stroke and heart attack, respectively. They had not languished in pain as so many of their peer group had done and as one niece said, ""They did well with their lives!"" Whereas the loss was duly grieved, one could not help but smile upon looking back over their busy lives. They had made the most of every moment ""God"" had allocated to them. They took the good with the bad in stride; troopers of a very special order. With some reluctance, they decided to have a small wedding in the back yard and Valerie's two daughters delighted in arranging flower sprays around the arbor and the canopies that covered the dining tables. They fussed over their mother and even wheeled ""Ma's"" hospital bed to the window so she could watch. It was a festive occasion with family and dear friends present to celebrate their official union.

The next morning they left by plane to Florida where they would board their honeymoon liner.

While getting dressed for dinner, Barry suddenly doubled over, flushed red and sank to the floor. At forty years old, he was suddenly dead of a heart attack. Valerie was a very strong, spiritual person, but almost fell to pieces when she realized Barry was gone. She didn't need the ship's doctor to tell her what happened. She felt it and she knew Barry was dead and there was no hope of him being resuscitated. She was in shock, but rose to the occasion, abandoning the ship with the gourney and Barry's body. She made the necessary calls home to let the family know. Barry's son flew down immediately to help Valerie while other family members sat wringing their hands and sobbing. They had not even had time to clean up after the wedding. Bright colored wrapping paper with pretty white bows overflowed in the trash cans out back. Other presents in boxes still lay on the kitchen counters as the girls were planning to collect the cards and send thank you notes to the guests. Part of the cake sat in the refrigerator and empty as well as half filled liquor bottles adorned the kitchen and pantry. The festive occasion, now turned sour, left everyone grappling for something to say or do, but their was nothing but attend to the funeral arrangements.

Valerie went through the motions, doing what she had to do and only in private permitting herself to openly cry. She had two daughters, Barry's son and his mother to attend to, so she resolved to move on with her life as best she could. She felt the void, but continued their routine of sitting by ""Ma's"" bed for the nightly reading. Three weeks after Barry's death, Valerie sat by her mother-in-law's bed when Ma suddenly looked up, straining her eyes to see something or someone in the room,. She had not been able to focus nor had she shown any interest until that point and Valerie turned to see what she was looking at. It was late, she was tired and had been about ready to call it a a night when she saw Barry standing there smiling. Barry was a Libra, ruled by the planet Venus, Goddess of Love & Beauty and was true to his ruling planet. He was meticulous in his dress and personal appearance which the apparition mimicked except for one small detail. He was wearing an orange tie with little white ghosts all over it. Valerie looked at him and asked, ""Where did you get that God-awful tie..."" The only response she got was a smile. When she turned to look at Ma and then looked back, he was gone. A few hours later, his mother passed and Valerie knew that he had come for her, The ghostly tie was a reflection of his sense of humor. She was not afraid nor was there any reason to be. Barry was the same in death as in life and a tender last moment passed between them as he faded into Netherlands forever.

There was no question and answer scenario as in many of my other stories. I listened and gave feedback as best I could. She wanted to share this with someone and I was the one. Thank you, Valerie. Hope all is well. Hugs!

Through the Pali with the Help of Pele,United States Minor Outlying Islands,Misc,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Misc :: Through the Pali with the Help of Pele

M y mother is a very spiritual women. She believes in the good and the bad spirits and the powers they have. We are Hawaiian and come from a family of healers, now and days we would be called witches. Within our family certain members were given the gift of preminisions or the ability to sense or see things that mot cant. Recentally My mother, step-father, my 2 brothers and I had flown to Waimanalo to visit my family for 11 days. Towards the end of our trip we decided to visit the big island. Where my mother explained more about our culture by visiting sites such as the chain of craters and the refuge. One thing my mother mentioned was ""Pele does not like it when you take apart of her..."" i.e. Rocks or leaves ""if you take it from where ever you are, even to another islan, bad luck will follow you and the rest of our family. So DONT take anything"". Not because it was a long day, but anyone who takes a plane ride or even attempts to go near an airport is exhausted. Since we were the 1st plane to the big island and the last plane back to Oahu all in the same day I'm sure you could assume just how tired we were.

My step-father is a great man. He tries so hard and we love him for it. Being a kid he didn't have good experiences, it was like he wasn't allowed to have fun (I was told by my mother) so sometimes its not his fault when he acts the way he does. He's sometimes a Mr. Know-it-all and even when hes wrong he doesn't like to admit it. Like most men. :) and he can sometimes be ""butthead""; we (my brothers and i, even sometimes my mom) call him a boob. Being that he married my mother he became very accustomed to the hawaiian culture and was very well accepted by the rest of my family. He's visited hawaii in general maybe about 3 times in all so its not like he really knows his way around.

On our way back from the airport headed towards waimanalo he got onto the wrong freeway headed towards waikiki. The completely wrong way. My mother tried to tell him and he got so flusterd he got off at the next exit to turn around and go back the way we came from, but when he did it wasn't headed back the way he wanted to go. It was a completely different street. So here we are in the middle of downtown waikiki lost. My mother and step-dad are arguing about which way to go and how to get back home. When we finally get back onto the freeway (still going the wrong way) my step-dad finally says to my mom ""WELL IF YOU KNOW WHERE WERE GOING DO YOU WANT TO DRIVE?!"" my mother said she can't because of all the medication she is on beacuse of her being sick with lupus. When we see the exit for the Pali the car is sient. My brothers are quietly making fun of my step-dad in the back seat and my mother is looking out the window.

My mother says that as we were driving when the lights lining the highway shown on my step-dad it was him but when it was dark out of the corner of her eye she saw and old women, with long white hair, and what looked to be a head lei and a sash. She said she saw this from the bottom of the Pali to the end. She said the figure wasn't a frightening or mean presence but she looked to be very attentive, almost as if she was trying to get somewhere. My mother said it was like she was helping my step-dad find our way back on the right road after being lost.

When my mother mentioned this to my Uncle (a very spiritual and well educated man) he said with no hesitation ""It was Pele guiding you"". He continued to explain Pele has many different forms but always white. Such as a white dog, a women with White hair, or a women with a white dog, a white owl...""

Maybe my mother was tired. Maybe not. But I would like to believe it WAS Pele.

Demon Hunter,"New Jersey, United States",Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: Demon Hunter

A t first I didn't believe in demons and what not. But that all changed when my brother went to the cemetery just for kicks. After he was done, he went home and that's when my nightmare began. I was in my back yard when I heard my mom calling my name. I went to see what she wanted, but no one was there. I asked her if she called me and she said no.

Two days past and nothing. I was watching TV when my sister started to scream, I ran into her room to see what was wrong. She was sitting in her bed. Broken glass everywhere. I walked in to see what had happen, she said that she saw two shadowy like figures looking at her. I was so mad that I ran outside wanting to fight anyone but there was nothing. I went back to my sister to see if she was okay, she told me that the shadows made the glass brake.

Two more days past and I was beginning to sense that something evil was in my house, but I didn't say. Night after night I stayed up waiting to see if anything happen. I really didn't care about anything at that time, I just wanted to know what was going on. One day a priest came to my house and blessed it. To tell you truth that really didn't work because the same night I went jogging and I felt something behind me. I suddenly turn my head and saw a shadow person.

The thing that's funny is people think that they're aliens. But they're really Demons, I know because I am hunting them down for like seven years now. Some people say I might be crazy. But I've been to doctors and they all say the same thing, that I am fine.

Seeing Dad... Again,"Texas, United States",Family / Friends Visits,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Family / Friends Visits :: Seeing Dad... Again

M any incidents have happened in my life, benevolent AND malevolent views of the other side(s) ;) This is by far the more impressive and comforting incident of my life. My father died in January 2001 from pancreatic cancer. He was luckier than most that the excruciating pain that accompanies such a cancer, only struck him the morning prior to his passing later that evening. For most of the last day of his life, he was semi-comatose. He passed away shortly before 10PM.

I hadn't felt my father around at all, until the summer after his death. It was a very hot day, June, July, or August, I can't be sure. Just hot, humid a regular scalding Texas afternoon. I was at my mother's, had just finished mowing her yard, and was sitting in the shade under her oak trees, cooling off with a glass of iced tea after my yard work. I know I wasn't asleep, it was too hot for that... And I was gritty and sweaty from midday mowing.

I was sitting facing the house, and I saw my father as plain as day, walk across the yard and toward the corner of the house. He was approximately 30 feet from me. He was dressed in a red & blue stripped shirt, sleeves rolled up to his elbows, had on his favorite pair of Levi jeans, dark blue running shoes, and was striding with purpose, his head down as if in contemplation, arms swinging. He was as solid as if he were flesh and blood, oblivious to my presence.

I had a good 15-20 second view of him before he disappeared... It was amazing. I just sat in awe, a wonderful feeling of peace washed over me. I shared this with my sister, who is firm believer due to her own experiences. However, I was hesitant to share with Mom, who gets the willies easily. :)

I did finally share this with my Mom. She wasn't as weirded out as I thought she would be, considering he disappeared into the wall of her house! LOL. Over the last 6 years, Mom has had a few things happen to her that could only be my father, like waking her in the middle of the night like he used to when he was alive. My sister has seen him reflected in windows behind her.

I feel particularly blessed that I witnessed him one more time. When I'm at my Mom's, I do keep myself open to see if I get another sighting of Dad.

Weird Living Room,United Kingdom,Poltergeists / Physical Manifestations,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Poltergeists / Physical Manifestations :: Weird Living Room

F irst of all I am ten. This encounter happened a few months ago. We were having a no tech week so we couldn't watch tv. We had the lego down stairs and my dad picked me up from school and was now having a nap. It was raining outside and my friend knocked on the door and asked if she could stay here because she had lost her key.

We sat in the living room and started playing with the lego. I didn't have the lights on, so it was a bit dark. She started talking about ghosts and we had a long conversation about ghosts and how her history teacher is haunted. My foot became numb and I had a shiver down my spine. Then the glass door leading to the living room began to open. I shut it, it opened again. I did this a number of times and I shut the door properly, but it still opened.

Every time I opened the door I felt a icy hand grab my shoulder and send shivers down my spine. I turned on the lights and everything stopped. Then my brother arrived from school. We carried on talking about ghosts. A power cut that lasted 20 seconds. No more happened that day.

But throughout the following months I have had similar experiences, such as shivers and the door. I am now at my friend's house and when I walked pass her sister's room, I saw a black ghostly figure. Also when someone taps me on the back and they say ""did you feel that?"", next they don't touch me and they say ""did you feel that"" and I can feel a number of taps on my back so I say ""yes"" and they break the news to me but I still did feel something.

Was the Deceased Angry with Me?,Hong Kong,Apparitions / Voices / Touches,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Apparitions / Voices / Touches :: Was the Deceased Angry with Me?

A fter I had finished my studies at San Digo State University, I returned to my native city of Hong Kong in June 1979. From time to time, I visited my married sister who had 2 children, a 5-year-old boy and an 8-year-old daughter. During one of these visits, my sister told me that her husband's uncle had just passed away and that the next day she had to go to the funeral parlor to prepare for a buddhist ceremony which would begin in the evening. She asked if I could look after the children while she was away and took the children to the funeral parlor around 7pm.

It was OK with me and I arrived with the children as I had been told. There were rows of chairs and people were waiting for the monk to pray for the soul of the dead so he could be in peace. There was the casket and a big picture of the deceased in the front. I immediately found a place to sit down and then I noticed that actually everybody bowed to show respect to the deceased before they sat down. I wanted to leave my seat to bow but then, I had to ask several people to excuse me. Besides, it might seem awkward to go out to bow after being seated. So I did not pay respect to the dead, like people say.

After the ceremony, my sister suggested that I spend the night in her house and I slept in my niece's room. It was then that something happened, which to this day, after 28 years, still puzzles me. So I went to bed and for some reason I woke up and saw my sister, in a white night gown, at the foot of the bed, walking away. Thinking that she might be looking for a pillow or something, I went back to sleep.

The next morning at breakfast, I asked her what she was looking for when I was sleeping and she said that she had never gone into the room. I told her what I had seen and she said that it might have been her daughter looking for something in her room. But I told her that the person I saw was about 5 foot 4, an adult, and her daughter was only about 4 feet. Then my sister, who is a timorous person, began to look really scared and did not even want to stay in the apartment. Finally, her husband told me not to talk nonsense and I never mentioned this again.

So, did I really see a ghost who was annoyed with my for not bowing to him?

Repetitive Voices,Canada,Family / Friends Visits,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Family / Friends Visits :: Repetitive Voices

M y cousin (I can't tell his real name and, I will call him Bryan for this story.) was in Pugwash N.S. cutting down some birch trees because he makes wooden chairs and sells them. He had a non electric saw and started sawing and he started hearing all these different voices talking. Then he stopped sawing and they stopped. He started sawing again and the voices started, again. He said this went on three times. He went and looked up and down the road to see if there was anybody around. There was no one about.

So, he went back sawing and he still could hear the voices again as he sawed. This happened a few more times and then he decided to pretend he was sawing. He then heard, this one voice saying, ""Kat-tie,Kat-tie,Kat-tie..."" He wondered about that and told his mother about it. She called my mother (she is her sister) and asked her about it. My mother is psychic and she told her sister that it has something to do with the past of their old home stead. Time was repeating itself and he was picking that up. He said the voice he heard was my mother's mother. She died several years ago and he met her years before that and thought this was strange.

My aunt was so scared after hearing this! He told her, ""Spirits can't hurt you!"" She calmed down after that. He says, he will continue to go and cut down more birch trees soon. He's not afraid of what happened to him.

Night Time Visitors,Australia,Apparitions / Voices / Touches,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Apparitions / Voices / Touches :: Night Time Visitors

W hen I was young boy living in Australia I was a very light sleeper, very sensitive, too. If someone entered my room while I was asleep they would wake me up even if they were trying to be quiet. I would also somehow know whether it was my Mum or Dad or one of my two sisters, I mean as soon as I woke up I'd know exactly which family member was in my room.

Twice I was woken in the middle of the night and my gift failed me. I don't recall how young I was at the time, but I was easily under 10 years of age.

The first time I woke up and opened my eyes I was looking straight into the face of a figure leaning over me. I say ""face"" because he was leaning over me, but truth be told I couldn't see a face, or make out any distinguishing features at all; it was just a dark shape, leaning over me. I do not believe it was my father, although he was a big man and this figure leaning over me was large as well, because it didn't ""feel"" like my father. My reaction at finding a stranger leaning over me in the middle of the night was immediate and frantic. I grabbed my teddy bear, yanked the covers over my head and burrowed down to the foot of the bed. If it had been my father checking on me, I'd like to think he would have responded to this reaction by letting me know it was him and seeking to calm me down... But there were no such fatherly reassurances that night.

I distinctly remember the next morning asking my Mum if she or Dad had come into my room to check on me. I know they used to do that, but it was never anything more than opening my door and peeking in, which would still wake me up. This was someone who'd entered my room and been leaning over me with their ""face"" barely a foot or so from mine, and they hadn't been a member of my family.

A year or two later (I'm unclear on my exact age, I'm 38 now so we're probably going back a good 30 years or so) I was again woken in the middle of the night. When I woke up I could sense someone standing at the foot of my bed, looking at me. Again if either of my parents had been checking on me they would have done nothing more than popped their head in the door, but this figure was standing at the foot of my bed, and it didn't feel like my parents. Oddly enough, despite there being a street light right outside my bedroom window, and despite having excellent night vision (I wear sunglasses all the time because even a cloudy day is too bright), my room was pitch black and I couldn't see a thing, but I knew someone was there in the dark, watching me. I could feel them there and it terrified me.

I've since spoken with other people who've had visitors in the night (people I personally know and trust) and they've all been able to describe their visitor, their facial features, clothing, everything. They've also told me that while they were a little disturbed to wake up and find someone watching over them, that they also felt calm and at peace and they somehow knew their visitor meant them no harm.

My midnight visitors were dark apparitions that scared me half to death. I was never harmed, but they were not peaceful experiences at all.

The Dean's Visit,Suriname,Family / Friends Visits,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Family / Friends Visits :: The Dean's Visit

T his happened today. The Dean Head of the Board of the Faculty where I work died last month after a sudden illness. He was very loved by his students and we all were devastated. This morning, a month after his passing, the cleaning lady opened the door to the Board room to do some cleaning. She said that when she opened the door, she felt cold chills. She went into the room to turn on the lights, as the room was dark. When she turned on the lights, she froze: there, at the table, was the Dean, sitting in his chair, smiling at her. He wore a blue shirt with white stripes. He wasn't transparent or anything, he was just sitting there as if he was still made of flesh and blood. She blinked and he was gone.

The cleaning lady stormed out of the room. The Secretary of the Board, who was close to the Dean and his family, was on her way to the Board room. She saw the cleaning lady and immediately knew something was wrong. She took her to another room and trembling all over the lady related her story. It turned out that since his passing, the Dean had shown himself to 4 other people outside of the Faculty, including his wife. They guessed that he was probably waiting for the Secretary of the Board who usually went into the Board room around that time of the morning.

The Basement Dancer,"Michigan, United States",Poltergeists / Physical Manifestations,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Poltergeists / Physical Manifestations :: The Basement Dancer

T he year, I think, was 1992 in December. I was 8 years old. On this day my mother and father had gotten home from shopping. I was excited to find out that they had gone Christmas shopping! So as I was looking through the already wrapped gifts, I saw that I had less then everyone else. Being a kid I quickly started whining and threw a fit all over the place. Even during the explanation of why I had less (I later found out it was because I was the one constantly digging and peeking through my gifts so they didn't want to put more under the tree then they already had too until the last minute).

I ran downstairs with only the light from the backdoor window shining down the steps enough to give me a view of them. Not realizing that no other light was on, as I got to the bottom I turned the corner into the living area where there was a bed for ""guest"" and I jumped on it digging my face into the pillow. See, I thought someone was going to come down after me but I guess they just wanted me to cry it out.

After a while my ears picked up a noise coming from around the stairs in the Laundry Room (see if you went downstairs you turned the opposite from the living area and went beside the steps to the laundry room. It was like a whole other area back there with two closets and a little storage space behind the steps. From there you could actually grab someone's legs coming down because the stairs were gaped in between them, if you know what I'm saying). For a few seconds I would try to understand the noise and figure out where it was actually coming from. Then I thought about the Laundry Room. To my horror I then realized what it sounded like... Baby dress shoes dancing or jumping. My heart stopped and I could not move. Even my voice was no more after trying to call out for my mom. After a few seconds (which felt like hours) I started moving off the bed looking around the dark corner at the same time. The Steps and the small part of the concrete floor lid up by the back door was the only comfort I had. Moving closer to the steps the ""dancing"" still continued and did so until I arrived at the first step.

Just before I began to run, it sounded as if the noise was coming closer to me from around the corner. About that time I was running up the steps yelling ""mom!, Mom!"" at the same time waiting for something to grab my feet on the way up. I can still remember the feeling of something staring at me from the bottom of the steps.

This house was not new when my parents bought it. So many strange things have happened in this house during the time we had lived in it (1988 - 1995).

Pioneer Ghost Lady of Newcastle,"California, United States",Ghost Hunting,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Ghost Hunting :: Pioneer Ghost Lady of Newcastle

I hate doing ghost investigations on weeknights, because the next morning I have to get up and go to work. But, this is one ghost investigation I had to check out. I was meeting up with Shannon 'Ms. Macabre' McCabe at her home right after work. We headed out in her black VW sports car affectionately called, ""The Ectoplasmobile"".

Shannon and I discussed various investigations that we have been on all the way to the small quaint town of Newcastle, CA. Shannon drives like a bat-out-of-hell and there was many times I was putting my foot on an invisible brake pad. As we drove past a makeshift grave on the side of the road, I said silent prayers that Shannon would get me to Newcastle safely. She did, but then thoughts of Shannon driving me back home came to my mind and I started shivering again. I was more scared of Shannon's driving than I was of any possible ghosts we might encounter at Constable Jacks.

Let's get a run down of what haunts Constable Jacks, a very cool bar, nightclub that has live band entertainment. Historical records provided by H.P.I. Researcher, Kristen Sheley indicate that:

""A ghost of a young man in his twenties haunts this old saloon and restaurant. Employees nicknamed him 'Gary'. He is blamed for wine bottles and glasses that fly off the shelves behind the bar. The glasses never break when they hit the floor. Gary is known to roam the basement and switch lights on and off. This establishment was formerly known as Soracco's Restaurant and Saloon, located at 525 Main Street in Newcastle. The former owner Gus Soracco thinks that Gary the Ghost was 'done in' at this bar. Gus Soracco has felt Gary's presence behind him, when he used to close down this establishment...""

Now that this establishment has turned over to a new owner Jacquie Looper, she has her own stories. Jacquie's grandfather from 1910 to 1920 was the owner of Constable Jacks. Her grandfather was the Constable of Auburn, CA. Some of the activities that have occurred under her watch include:

2. When Jacquie was saying that she didn't believe in ghosts, 10 to 12 bud vases flew off the refrigerator on their own accord.

3. Her daughter Sheena Looper has witnessed a spotlight blinking off and on and then only to discover that the spotlight was not even plugged in!

5. Patrons have claimed to seen a young woman in her 20s, with blonde hair peeking around corners wearing a pioneer dress.

6. Shylah & Dana (daughters of Jacquie) were cleaning around the bar late at night when they called their mom and asked her why the flashlight was left on at the bar and why the candle was lit. This has never happened before, but for some reason the flashlight came on and the candle was lit and no one was around to light it. The girls hastened it out the front door, scared to their wits! On another night, they witnessed a candle one of the girls was holding in her hands and it lit on its own, then they heard running footsteps across the roof. Again, they made haste out the door!

7. Sheena relates to me that the town of Newcastle burned down 3 times and that this bar also once caught on fire. You can see the burned timbers in the basement. The basement at one time was a brothel. A psychic who came to this establishment believes the ghostly pioneer woman's name is 'Emily'.

The date of this investigation is: August 8, 2007, Tuesday. Investigative Team included: John Wachter aka Vlawde - Lead Investigator, Alicia Perry - Tech Support, Chris Grissom - Tech Support, Kristen Shelly - Researcher, Shannon McCabe - President, Paul Dale Roberts - Ghostwriter, Mary Casiano - Investigator, Michelle Paykel - Investigator, Cherie Vincent - Scout/Investigator. Kudos to Cherie for scouting this establishment and getting this investigation authorized by the owners!

As the investigative team sought out different locations to investigate under the guidance and direction of Vlawde, I surveyed the establishment with a keen eye. I was an awe at the macabre decorations, such as a mannequin woman that was dressed as a vampire dominatrix that was attached to the ceiling. The place was like a museum filled with artifacts and relics of years gone and dashed with relics of the present. Fascinating eye-candy for party goers!

I went into the basement , it was very dark and quite spooky. It was a very large basement that had nooks and crannies everywhere. Huge potholes that you could fall into and dirt shoved off to the side making a small embankment or hill. This was the perfect spot for a ghost or ghosts! As Chris Grissom manned the TV monitor, he was capturing all kinds of strange orbs either moving methodically slow or moving at lightning speed.

Shannon picked up an EVP that was an inaudible whisper. As I conclude this article, let's see what Shannon has for the FINDINGS and CONCLUSION.

As some of the investigative team went into the basement, one of the investigators, Alicia Perry felt a presence touching her. She felt like she was touched 3 times.

I tried to entice the spirit of ""Emily"" or ""Gary"" with Cherie Vincent. Cherie started picking up some unusual spikes near us, with her EMF (Electromagnetic Field) meter and it furiously started flashing with a red light. We videoed the area where the spikes happened and with further study we hope to have something to show you.

All in all, this was a very unusual establishment that I would love to visit when I am not ghost hunting and perhaps enjoy a cold beer and listen to a band. Shannon and I, had to leave early, because we both have to work the next day... Well John has to work tomorrow too and has to get up at 4am, but since he is the lead investigator, he was going to tough it out for the long haul. Nice work, John!

So let's see what Shannon has to say... And thanks Shannon for getting me home safely and not in pieces! Whew! Shannon needs to put a red light on top of her car, you would think it was an emergency vehicle! Maybe her car is an emergency vehicle... Just call HPI 911 GOTGHOSTS!

""Sometimes I just want to knock him out"" says Shannon McCabe, President, H.P.I.

For more on H.P.I. (Haunted and Paranormal Investigations) of Northern California, stop by the web site at: www.HPIparanormal.net

FINDINGS: 3 EVP's saying ""Get Out"" in a whisper. ""Are we dead"" spoken in a male tone. ""Help me"" in a female tone, and other assorted inaudible whispers. We had lots of Orb video activity in the basement, and need to further analyze it for dust etc... One of the investigators, Alicia Perry was touched 3 times on the head and back by an unseen force in the basement.

CONCLUSION: ""Quite a neat place, lot's of very interesting art and some really excellent food! I'd say that, yes, out of what we examined in the short time we were there the place is indeed haunted. I'd give it a 6.5 on the spook factor, it's just too neat of a place and it has such good energy that I can't give it too spooky of a factor""

Small White Ghosts,Argentina,Apparitions / Voices / Touches,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Apparitions / Voices / Touches :: Small White Ghosts

T he encounter was nine years ago, the time was between 3:55am-5:00am; I was begging my mother not to leave me by myself because I was afraid of being left alone. She reassured me that my father would come within one hour. Despite my begging and sobbing, she left me at the doorway of our home. I was so scared of being left alone that I ran to my bedroom and crawled into bed with my younger bother. I heard what seemed like footsteps and voices; I quickly got up and ran to my bother's side of the bed, and tried desperately to wake him up. He would not awake from his slumber. I burst in tears, I have never felt so frighten in my life. The voices seemed to get closer and closer until these white small ghosts surrounded my body, their lips moved as if trying to tell me something of importance. I didn't care what they wanted to say to me, I just wanted it all to go away, so I slumped down on my knees and sobbed uncontrollably.

Next thing I know I woke up in the floor. I tried telling my parents about it, my best of friends, almost everyone I was acquainted with. I'm now fourteen years old although none believed me; those images are some of the things that will stick with me until death...

Devoted Parents,"Ohio, United States",Misc,"I was spoken to by ghosts, only they did not reveal themselves in a visual form and they did not speak with voices, instead they spoke with energy. When I was working on my undergrad, I did a paper about cemeteries. I decided to go to the oldest cemetery in my tiny town, dating back to 1814. When I got there, one headstone stood out to me and made me feel sad. It was a marker for 3 little girls, all who had died by age 10.

A week later, I went back to visit them. I felt so sad for them, they were so young and their last names weren't even etched in the headstone. While visiting, I then got the overwhelming urge to look at the headstones behind their stone. I just ignored it and left. The following week I stopped by again. I got the same urge to look at the other headstones again and this time I went with it. Then I saw it, the back of their headstone. Written on the other side were their last names and the names of their parents. Then I felt this energy like someone telling me, ""We are good parents, thank you, but we can take care of our daughters..."" It seemed like the energy was all over, in the air, in the wind, and I could hear them even though they didn't speak.

The Man in my Bed,Canada,Psychic / Medium,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Psychic / Medium :: The Man in my Bed

I grew up in an old haunted farmhouse, every week for 7 years some weird unexplained thing would happen, such as people seeing a tall shadow of a man, my dead dog scratching the door, the tv turning off whenever there was swearing (gotta love the Victorians lol), etc. Being in this environment I became more sensitive... Sometimes I had dreams I was another girl, in some depressing American ghetto, which is totally different to my life so I wondered where that came from. Me and my two best friends started playing the Ouija board (which made us SO tired all the time but much more sensitive!)

One night when I was 14, I awoke in the middle of the night and there was a soft blue glow in the room. I turned to face the other way, and that's when I saw him sitting next to me on the bed - I slowly looked him over: brown boots, blue jeans, blue checkered shirt, big brown eyes staring ahead reminiscently. He looked as solid as you or me. With a start, he realized I was awake, tilted his head down and smiled at me. This was the first time I saw a ghost; until then I thought I'd pee my pants or have a heart attack if I saw one, but I felt so calm and content. I don't know why but my first reaction was to touch him; but as soon as I tried, he vanished. This was 10 years ago this month, and since then he's appeared in my dreams at least once every two months.

Starting about a year before this happened, there was already about 6 spirits who would regularly appear in my dreams, I could talk to them on the Ouija board or automatic writing too. They were all friends, all from American ghettos, and they always looked the same, acted the same, same names, every time I dreamt of them. This lasted about 6 years altogether. They gave me some information on him: only his name (I'll call him Keith), Madison projects, and Alabama. They said I knew him in a past life... Within a month of seeing 'Keith,' I was so depressed, living on that farm with more dead people than living people around me. My family and friends all had experiences in that house, like seeing or hearing or feeling something, but as for me and my two friends, after playing the Ouija board for so long, we could actually communicate telepathically with them; unfortunately nobody believed us and thought we were mentally ill. I felt so betrayed that even my own family, after years of experiencing such things together, wouldn't believe me. On the other hand I felt such a strong connection to the spirits that I would rather be with them.

In my despair, I attempted suicide by overdose. My Mom rushed me to the hospital where I was in intensive care, my body was twice its size (so I was told, I don't remember much about it). The doctor came in and said I had 2 days to live. My Mom was hysterical; seeing my Mom like that is the worst experience in my entire life. I felt like a coward, I felt so guilty. I wondered if I was going to die; but I felt empty, and for once I didn't feel the spirits around me. During my stay in the hospital, once I saw a tall shadow of a man walk quickly into the room, and disappear.

The next day I was in a room next to a guy screaming with a helmet on and something sharp stuck in his head(!?) so I figured I was in the worst part of the hospital and didn't have long to live. But by some miracle (I never asked why) I actually survived. It took one month of bed rest to recover. Once I was recovered, I saw the spirits in a dream; we were in a field, and they approached me and said that I can't handle them now, and they're sorry. They shook my hand and said goodbye. For 6 months after that dream, there was no ghostly activity at all...

The Funeral of my Mom,Poland,Family / Friends Visits,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Family / Friends Visits :: The Funeral of my Mom

I live in Poland and just about 4 years ago, my mother died. I was 19 at the time. My mother had cancer and a family doctor told us she was going to die in a couple of months, but she kept on fighting for a year. Her funeral was on april 1, just 4 days before her 50th birthday. The whole family was there and everyone was really sad about the funeral but me and my sister were honestly happy that she didn't have to suffer any more.

I remember the day of the funeral perfectly. It was a very cold day and very windy. The sky was very cloudy and honestly I wanted to put on my winter jacket because I was freezing. When the coffin was being put into the ground, a big ray of sunlight touched me and my sister who was standing beside me. We stared at each other and smiled. In just 2 sec, we felt warm and happy. That was the weirdest thing because the whole day felt like winter and when the coffin was being put into the ground, it felt like I was in heaven.

Another weird thing that happened 3 days before she died, she said that her younger sister came and said that she has been waiting for her. My Aunt died 30 years ago but we all believed in this. I'm a catholic but I didn't really feel like there is an after life, but after this day I became a true believer.

Walking on the Roof,"California, United States",Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: Walking on the Roof

T his took place in San Diego about 6 or 7 years ago. I lived in a two story house with with my mother and stepfather. The roof of the house was angled steeply on both sides. To get an image of the house and where I was at, the front door opens right to a small tiled area with the door to my bedroom on the left and the door to the garage on the right. A straight staircase from the tiled area leads upstairs to the living room, kitchen, and other bedrooms. There is a hatchway to the attic in the ceiling at the top of the staircase.

Early on a Saturday evening I was home alone in my bedroom with the door closed and I heard someone knock on my door. Now, my parents were long gone at Lake Havasu so I know they weren't around. I could see the area by the front door from my window so I looked there but didn't see anyone but I went to the front door anyway. Before I opened the front door I heard very heavy thumping sounds from the ceiling; as if someone was walking across the roof or in the attic. I just stood there at the bottom of the staircase staring up the stairs at the attic hatch for literally at least 5 minutes and the footstep sounds continued. One minute it sounded like someone walking slowly and the next sounded like someone jogging the next minute it stopped like someone was pacing randomly.

I kept telling myself there was an animal up there but animals just don't sound like this did. I was pretty scared but very curious too. I grabbed a chair and a bat from my bedroom and headed upstairs. I'm not sure what I thought I was going to do but went anyway. Going up the stairs and closer to the ceiling I'm positive it was coming from the attic. Besides the roof was very steep so I can't imagine someone walking around too much up there. When I got to the top of the stairs and under the attic door, I lost most of my nerve and just waited. The steps had stopped for the moment and then it sounded as if someone sprinted across the ceiling and stopped right above me. It was so loud and so clear I can still hear it now. I decided not to look in the attic after that and instead to just left whatever it was alone. I left the house for the night soon after that and never heard footsteps again.

I've had other strange experiences and encounters in this house, one of which I talk about in the entry titled invisible rain .

A Visit from Dad,"Nebraska, United States",Family / Friends Visits,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Family / Friends Visits :: A Visit from Dad

O n January 1, 2006 at 5:57 AM my father passed away. All of my family was there as we had been keeping vigil at his home for several days knowing the end was near. He had been pretty much unconscious for about 2 days and kept weakening from that point on. It was very difficult to have him go, but he had suffered so over the past year, that we all (my sister, 2 half brothers and step mother) felt he had had enough and was tired. In one of his more lucid moments he had told me he was tired and he did not want to die in the hospital alone, that was about 6 days before he passed. We took him home from the hospital and made him as comfortable as possible. We had hospice care coming in and all spent as much time with him as possible.

As I stated before, he passed away on New Years day. It was a Sunday morning. After he passed, my step mother called our church and one of the Associate Pastors came to the house to be with us. He visited for about half an hour while we waited for the coroner and everything. He then asked what we needed and what we were going to do now. My husband said, well it is Sunday so I say we go to church, that is what dad would have wanted. We all agreed and went home to clean up and get ready for church.

When I got home, I went in and took a hot relaxing bubble bath; I closed my eyes for a minute to relax. When I opened my eyes I saw a white mist shaped like a man standing at the entrance to the bathroom door (my husband made me leave it open because he was worried.) I said ""Daddy"" and the mist was gone. At that point I chalked it up to exhaustion.

I do not remember the church service but that afternoon, my step mother wanted us to come to the house to pick up a few little things dad wanted us to have. My sister was there with her two girls and husband, I was there with my 2 girls and 2 boys and my stepmother, 1 of my stepbrothers were all there. My stepmother asked me to go up to hers and dad's room and get dad's watch off of the dresser. At the top of the stairs there is a small book case built into the wall. My dad had placed a collectible small brass cannon and brass vase on the middle shelf behind a bouquet of flowers, still visible but blocked by the vase.

As I walked by the book case, the brass cannon and brass vase shot off the shelf almost simultaneously and hit the wall across from the shelves right in front of me. They fell on the floor and rolled to my feet. My niece, 11 years old saw this happen, ran down the stairs and jumped in her father's lap, she would not move. I picked up the cannon and vase and placed them back on the shelf. I went into the bedroom and was looking in the dresser for the watch I had been sent after. I heard a noise in the hallway. Thinking it was a family member I spoke out for them to come in and help me look. No one came, I looked in the hall way and no one was there. I found the watch and entered back into the hall way. I looked down and the brass cannon and vase were in the middle of the floor where they had fallen before. I picked them back up and sat them back on the shelf. At that point my stepmother hollered up the steps for me to grab the brass cannon and vase on my way down because my father had wanted me to take them. I picked them up and carried them downstairs, a little bit bewildered.

While we sat there that evening, dealing with our grief and emotions, the hall light began turning on and off. You could count exactly 120 seconds between on and off switches. I went home that night very late and exhausted.

I go to the house constantly to visit with my stepmother. The hallway has still had strange occurrences especially with items in the middle shelf and the lights in the hall way, both upstairs and down stairs. My step mother pretty much refuses to acknowledge the occurrences and goes on. I think it may be my dad watching out for us a little bit in his own way.

Man in the Basement,"California, United States",Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: Man in the Basement

I was 13 at the time and at a friend's house. His sisters room was down in the basement and there was an entrance at the end of the living room. She was showing us how her horse ribbons kept turning upside down. She turned them right side up and tried to move them by waiving her blanket. They didn't budge. We were there alone and we heard someone walking upstairs in the kitchen above. We looked at each other and as I was about to ask if their mom was home, we heard a chair slide across the floor from the kitchen, through the living room and fell down the stairs into the basement. We couldn't move!

Another time, at the same house, we were doing our homework and we heard footstep on the roof. As he looked at each other, the dryer started going while it was unplugged.

When they moved out because of other strange things that took place, the landlord asked if they were moving because of the ghost. They were shocked and explained the things that had happened to them. He explained that the owner before him was an elderly man who walked in and surprised two unsuspecting thieves. They dragged the old man down to the basement, tortured and killed him down there.

A Messsage from Beyond,United Kingdom,Family / Friends Visits,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Family / Friends Visits :: A Messsage from Beyond

I have always been hugely skeptical of any carry over once our physical bodies are deceased, but my whole outlook changed after contact from the spirit world. The story started in Plymouth shortly after my sister in law passed away from cancer, leaving behind two young children. A couple of weeks later, my wife and I were watching television when my wife looked over at me and said ""did you hear that?"", she explained that she heard the front door open and a person walk through the hall, but my ears were silent to it.

A week later I arrived home early from work and ran the bath for a good long soak, as I slid into the bath I heard the front door open and a person come in, I assumed it was my wife as she was due back from work around then, but everything remained silent after that. I got out of the bath dressed and looked around no one bar our dog who was looking up the stairs as if at somebody.

The noises carried on for another week until one night, while we were asleep upstairs, the telephone crashed on the floor downstairs. The following day we heard a child minder looking after her children was found dead in her house after sniffing some substance that same night.

After that the noises stopped completely. Now I look at life in a whole different light.

Grandpa Checking on Me,"California, United States",Family / Friends Visits,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Family / Friends Visits :: Grandpa Checking on Me

W hen I was 10, I used to sleep where my Great Grandfather's office was. My brother had the extra bedroom my Grandfather would use and my parents had the room that him and my Grandmother would share. My Grandmother is still with us, but my Grandfather passed away when I was 5. I had trouble sleeping and a terrible fear of the dark so my parents left the hallway light on for me.

I would have my door open a bit so the light could go in. Sometime in the middle of the night, I woke up to the sound of the shower. There is a bathroom at the end of the hallway that I can see from my room. I looked at it, the door was open a crack and the light was off. I heard the nozzle turn off the water and the shower door open.

Someone got out and closed the shower door. Then I heard the bathroom door creek open without it moving. I heard footsteps walk to the door of my brother's room. The door creeked open, but didn't move. It went inside and I didn't move from the position I was in. I stared at the bathroom door for what seemed like hours, and I fell asleep on my stomach.

Another time,  when I was in my bed trying to sleep, I had been having nightmares and so it was hard for me to sleep. Everyone was in bed already and when I finally got my eyes closed, I heard footsteps coming from the living room. It started getting closer to my room. I shut my eyes tight and hoped it wasn't going to stop in front of my room. The footsteps stopped outside my door. I opened my eyes and there was a shadow over my head. I flipped over to look and there was nothing there.

I wasn't too scared because after thinking about it, I thought it was my Grandpa checking on me. I was having a hard time in school and everything, so it made me feel better when something like that would happen. I had strange things happen in that room and even stranger things happen in the one I have now, but that's a whole other story.

Little Girl,Australia,Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: Little Girl

I had just moved into a new house on the border on new south wales. My father always wanted to live on a farm, so we brought a little crappy house and a big land. When my family and I went to look at the house, I felt a cold sensation on my body. I thought never the less, and kept my thoughts to myself.

It was finally the day and we moved in. My bedroom was on the very top floor with a tiny little window.  After packing all day I was very tired and fell asleep on my mattress. I woke up with doors slamming, my hair getting played with and lights flickering. What could this be? A spirit? Father always said that there are no such things as monsters, boogie men, spirits... Maybe he was wrong? Nothing happened for the past week.

On the Saturday night, Mum and Dad went out for dinner by themselves so I was left alone in the house. (I would of called a friend but I had just moved so I didn't know anyone.)  So I decided to watch some TV. I could hear the weirdest noise on the drive way. Our drive way was very long so I took a torch with me.  It almost sounded like a girl being hurt, but I wasn't quite sure. I went down the drive way to see if everything was okay, and I felt a body next to me. I looked around by no one was in site. I decided not to let it bother me. And still to this day, a little female spirit plays with my hair & plays around with the switches.

Andy,"California, United States",Poltergeists / Physical Manifestations,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Poltergeists / Physical Manifestations :: Andy

T his is a shorter version of what happened to me, you can read the original version here . I have dealt with ""things that go bump in the night"" most my life, making we always wonder if I was a bit of a strange child, but never did I dream I would live day to day with an entity. It can be just as spooky and un-nerving as all the movies you have seen, but it can also be very stressful. You just have to keep laughing and get through it. Easy to say now, years later.

We moved into a huge house on Twenty Third Street in a small farming town not far from San Jose just before Christmas, 1998. I lived there alone with three children while their father commuted to San Jose, coming home on the weekends.

The first night was filled with the new house exploration, the usual moving and settling in activities, keeping me heavily occupied both day and night. I knew there was a hidden cubbyhole in the kitchen cupboards, only two feet tall, two feet deep, one foot wide and about six feet off the ground. What puzzled us so greatly was the latch to prevent access to the hidden area was INSIDE the cupboard door, meaning you had to be INSIDE the cupboard in order to latch it. Talk about adding thoughts to your imagination!

I was going back and forth through the house, three thousand square feet of house built in a lovely 1920 French door style with large, wandering rooms and hallways, walk in closets, surprise turns and windows that led to nowhere. I absolutely love the Winchester Mystery House, so this suited me perfectly. The children were asleep and I was sorting, room to room. Each time I passed the cupboard, the door was open. I would close it, continue on my way, only to pass by later and again, to find it open. Again. I tried ever so hard to ignore the creepy feeling crawling up both arms to my neck. It kept occurring to me that I knew absolutely no one within a hundred miles. I was alone, with my three small children.

Since Christmas was rapidly approaching, I took the time when the children were asleep to wrap presents. I kept the wrapping papers in a very heavy, large, old trunk, opening at the top. When the trunk was opened, the top rested backwards heavily against the metal retaining straps. The balance of the lid was so that if the trunk had been empty, it would almost be in danger of tipping over backwards. I was in the process of removing rolls of paper from the trunk and had just withdrawn my hand when the lid came crashing closed and the animals ran from the room. It took my breath away and all remaining logical thoughts from my brain. I must have sat for several minutes, stunned, yearning for a logical explanation. The animals didn't return for quite some time.

Further into the night, I was setting up the dining room table for meals, placing quilted placemats down for the family. One of the dog's two inch toy balls came rolling towards me, ever so slowly, ever so steadily, making the softest whispering sound as it gently rolled on the highly polished wooden floor. Not a sound could be heard except for the ball's whisper. When the ball stopped, the house was filled with silence. Eerie uncomfortable silence. The parrot was silent, watching the ball. The dogs were motionless, looking at me and the ball with puzzled expressions. I tried to convince myself this was normal. There was some explanation. I picked it up, placing it on the placemat in front of me. I stood there for the longest time and watched it. Nothing. Not sound, no movement. It HAD to have been moved by an animal I did not notice. Okay, heart beat back to normal. Things to do. Just as I started to turn away, the ball actually leaped into the air about a half inch, rolled off the table and back unto the floor. I watched it, in shocked silence as it made its way to the dining room wall where it stopped and rested, silent, finished.

The Woman in the Smoke,Philippines,Misc,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Misc :: The Woman in the Smoke

I grew up in the states, not knowing the mysteries and hauntings that took place in this dark country, until I saw it with my own eyes. It all started on a hot sunny day, in the Province of Laguna Philippines. My cousin Gena and I decided to take a dip, in a resort called Agua Vida (not to far from home) to cool off. Children playing, loud music, laughter, and the splashing of water filled the air.

We were having a blast, but little did we know what was going to occur later on that night. My cousin Gena screamed from the top of her lungs, claiming that she was in so much pain. Through out the night and through the morning it continued to worsen. My whole family has done everything, from medicine to herbal plants. Nothing worked, so my Auntie decided to take her to a local witch doctor hoping that she'd be cured. Through this whole process, a white clear stone (tawas) was used. The witch doctor rubbed that all over her body making crosses, then she put it in a glass of water for her to drink without swallowing, and finally... The last step was throwing that stone in burning charcoal.

I couldn't believe what my eyes were seeing. That burning charcoal formed a womanly figure with long hair. Chills ran up and down my spine as I remembered seeing an angry woman with long hair that day at the resort. I couldn't understand why she had that look on her face. It was said that this woman was furious with my cousin for invading her space. To punish Gena, she had cursed her with a severe pain. Luckily the pain was cured, but I had yet to figure out who this lady was. I asked around, giving her description, and hoping to get some closure on who this woman could possibly be.

They said there was a woman who drowned in that pool many years ago. Very seldom would she be seen, but I saw her as clear as seeing a living person.

Black House,"California, United States",Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: Black House

A s in Sirius Black. Reading Harry Potter was amazing, but if you ever wanted to see the fictional Sirius Black Manor jump into reality I know the place for you right here in the capital of California, Sacramento, 2131 H street sits in the heart of downtown, amidst the businesses and wealthy victorian houses with perfectly quaffed lawns.

For as long as 15 years I have walked by its neglected pall of dark windows, and dead lawn, watching the bees make their way in and out of a hole in one of the walls. Among the living, they alone occupy the manor. The manor is stunning and beautiful like finding a diamond on a street. Running into people including paranormal investigators is normal, we load our eyes with the strange shingles cut to look like dragon scales and fitted by the craftsmen expertly over the house. The stone lion heads that guard each door in the front of the house. The rough-faced blocks at the base and the careful stain glass give this house an aloof air.

The family that owns this home is closed mouth, but clearly this house was created by an eccentric; looking like a gothic castle in detail. A friend of mine put her name and number on a paper indicated she wanted to see the house and left it in the mail box. Later she checked the mail box her paper was gone and no one ever called her. People like me who come to this house really want to go inside. I once thought I saw a woman grimly staring at me though the second story window, but then I heard that the home was vacant.

The story is that this house was owned by one of the wealthy founders of Sacramento, and his wife was mysteriously murdered therein. The manor is not on the market, but back in the 70's a family moved in and said they heard struggling in the kitchen, shattering glass and saw cats mysteriously streaking through the rooms then vanishing. Legend is that family left quickly. There also is an odor of rotting flesh that is said to warn off unliked visitors that dare come into the yard. Looking up the owners, the house is listed under the Martiniz family and the house is caught up in a property dispute. The children wanting to sell it, but they cannot agree on specifics, and so it remains unused.

The family seems to do the minimum to take care of it. This manors many visitors are in love with it, but I also believe that the spirit prefers her existence this way - alone and untouched by time and the living.

Beverly Mansion,"Maryland, United States",Ghost Tours & Haunted Hotels,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Ghost Tours & Haunted Hotels :: Beverly Mansion

I 've always heard that Beverly Mansion was haunted, but I never actually believed it until I saw it... One night me and my friends decided to take a trip there, and wow, were we in for a big scare. It was just the four of us, going up to this vacant mansion in the middle of no where... But it had fresh stones in the driveway, and no keep out signs.

We parked the truck and hopped out, as we started walking up the drive way to this old fence, we could hear barking. And it sounded as if dogs were behind us. And I must reminds you, no one lives here. We all got scared and decided to go back but we saw truck lights coming up the long drive. We all jumped in the weeds, but one of my idiot friends jumped back out. The truck stopped and it was a tiny old man, pale as a ghost, and said ""what yee doing around here?"" we told him that our truck broke down, he asked if we needed help, but we said ""No we had it taken care of..."" Then he said kindly have a good night and pulled away.

Now, here's where it gets weird, One of my friends said ""Hey, you can see our foot prints in the stones... But how come there's no tire prints from the truck? We all looked back and noticed the truck was long gone, and that there was nowhere for it to turn off... We didn't say another word and just took off running for the truck... Now tell me... Was that guy real... Or a ghost?

Hand on my Shoulder,"California, United States",Psychic / Medium,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Psychic / Medium :: Hand on my Shoulder

N ot ""Revelation""-'tis-that waits, but our unfurnished eyes -Emily Dickinson

I was in my early 20's and far from the city that I grew up in. I didn't have a family really. My parents had loads of problems of their own, for starters my father had molested children, other than me, and after I reported him, my mom blamed me for ""tearing the family apart"". I wasn't close with my family in the least. I think even adults need some sort of tie to a parent of parental figure. It was hard feeling like I was all alone in the world. Even though my parents couldn't love and support me and I had been a foster child, I had always felt like my home was Sacramento, because most of my growing up had been there. And I had been living far away from Sacramento for a lot of years.

Life was really rough on me, I didn't have a good education, so economically I hadn't been able to improve my circumstances. Eventually, grinding poverty and hopelessness got the upper hand and I started to entertain thoughts of suicide. Whenever I wasn't working or taking care of my dog, I would cry. My baby-dog Jelly Bean would look at me with great concern during these times. Finally, things got so bad that I even had developed a plan; how I would do it and how to find the best home for Jelly Bean.

One very sad day, I had the day off work and was laying in bed. I had my eyes closed, but distinctly felt that someone had just entered my bedroom. I was afraid and not sure how I could defend myself. I suddenly felt calm, and got the impression I was not to be afraid, or to open my eyes. I perceived the individual as walking across the room towards me. Suddenly, a massive and strong hand grasped my shoulder! I dared not open my eyes, but knew from my position on the bed exactly how he must be stooped over looking directly in my face.

The palm rested over my clavicle and the fingertips overlapped my shoulder, the dimensions of this individual must have been astounding! I had remembered my aunt Kathy telling me that Grandpa Quinn was a large man and had big strong hands. The fear melted away, my awe continued, but somehow I just knew I had to keep my eyes shut or the exchange would end. I began to feel so warm! The warmth began in the core of my body and began to radiate out until I felt I was glowing as brightly as the sun! I felt an amazing energy going directly from the hand and taking hold in my body. It was like all the love and happiness life has to offer was being poured into me. I felt very protected too, as if this individually was letting me know I was in ""good hands""! In my dancing heart I felt that I had so many reasons to live! I had so much to give as well! And the desire to live and thrive overcame my suicidal plan.

Finally, I just had to see the face that belonged to this person, and I opened my eyes. As my lids flew open the hand disappeared, leaving me to look at a room completely empty except for my dog and myself. The energy remained though. Filling me with love and happiness. I had received a special, special gift that enlarged my view of life and my own purpose. I learned that life was larger than I had known, and that life was full of unseen angels. I had and have more obstacles in my life, but never-ever again did I feel I was alone and that my life was entirely meaningless or hopeless.

Dead Man Coming Back Home,South Africa,Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: Dead Man Coming Back Home

M y husband's brother and his wife has recently moved into a new place. We went to visit them on Tuesday and had a good time not realizing that anything was wrong. Yesterday while my sister-in-law and I were talking, she told me what they have been going through in their house! I was totally freaked out and told her they should move out!

She said for the past 3 weeks they have been haunted by the previous tenant of their house. As they investigated, the landlord told them that he actually died in a car accident last month. They have a 5 month old baby who lives with her mom but has come to visit them. The baby doesn't sleep at night. As soon as he falls asleep, he wakes up screaming like somebody has just pinched him. This has been happening now for 2 weeks.

This ""ghost"" apparently pulls out the plugs when the TV is on during the day. If anyone takes a shower, he switches off the bathroom lights and switches them back on when the person gets out of the shower. If any dishes are left in the kitchen sink, he washes them in the middle of the night. They literally hear water running and when they go and investigate they find either plates or glasses inside the sink, wet or even sometimes soapy!

They always have that uncomfortable feeling like someone is walking around the house!

In African culture, when a family member dies, they are ""fetched"" from the place where they passed on and taken to their final resting place. This fetching is done by either the parents of the deceased or other elders in the family. The spirit of the person is told that they have passed on and that they have a new home. A photograph or something familiar to the deceased is used, and once he/she has been explained to, the item is then covered with a cloth and taken to the grave and there only is it opened to release the spirit to its new home. It is our belief and custom and has been practiced for centuries.

Now in the case of this poor guy, his family have unfortunately taken on too much of the western culture and have apparently refused to do this in order to put their son to rest.

I just found it so sad that people could be so heartless as to know that their son's spirit is not rested and refuse to do their part to assist it.

I was told that hanging a horseshoe in the house acts as some sort of a barrier, not permitting ghosts entry into your house. I don't know how true this is but I have just purchased one for my sister-in-law today and I am hoping that they can have a good nights rest they haven't had in 3 weeks! I would love to hear everyone's comments on this!

Black Figure of my Lost Fiancee,Azerbaijan,Family / Friends Visits,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Family / Friends Visits :: Black Figure of my Lost Fiancee

I have read other people's stories in this site and at least, now I know that I am not the only one who experienced these kind of things. I've lost my fiancee in a car accident 7 months ago and since that day, it wasn't easy at all. I remember in early days of his death, I had this strange feeling that someone is watching me. I couldn't exactly see something but I could tell from where I was being watched.

Another strange thing that happened was one night, when I was sleeping in my room, I heard someone speaking and was awaken. I couldn't exactly understood the words as I was sleepy. When I opened my eyes I saw a familiar black figure at the end of my bed. I couldn't move or talk, but see just from the corner of my eye the black figure. I didn't see his face clearly but I felt that it was him. It was dark in the room. I wanted to open my mouth and talk but I couldn't. Some force didn't allow me to move at all. But somehow I was able to understand what he was saying. It wasn't usual communication with words. I just understood, felt what he was saying. He took my hand (all I felt was coldness, ice cold) and told me not to worry, that everything will be all right. I asked him not to leave but he said that if I try to look at him he will be gone.

When I woke up in the morning, all I felt inside was peace. I know that even though he is not among us. He still exists somewhere. He exists in our future. In the future which awaits us all...

I don't really know how old I was when this happened, but I know I was young. There was a man that lived across our street. He was poor. Well, we would always make BBQ for him. He gave us a boat for thanks. But who would think this would happen. He was in his house one day, around December. It was very cold so he used a trash can with fire in it to heat up a little bit. When he went to sleep, it tipped over and caught on fire. The trailer was bursting in flames. He had burnt to death in the trailer.

About nine years later, when I was on our couch watching t.v. the doorknob suddenly starting moving like somebody was trying to make it in. I figured it was my dad back from work. But it was around 11:12 and he got here around twelve. I looked out the window and saw a tall man trying to get in. It's funny because this has never even happened before around this block. It didn't happen again until three years later when I was 12.

Me and a couple of friends were eating pizza and watching a movie during the day. And I saw the doorknob start moving again. My friend had saw it but my other friend didn't. I am sitting at home waiting for this to happen again. I don't know if it is real or not. If you think it is real write me at jamesraybrown [at] yahoo [dot] com or leave a comment.

Awful and Long Weekend,Mexico,Poltergeists / Physical Manifestations,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Poltergeists / Physical Manifestations :: Awful and Long Weekend

L et me start up by briefly explaining the background. My mom's a singer and she often has to travel out of town (we live in Tijuana, Mexico). During last summer, her band was hired by a resort near the beach and they would perform almost the whole week day and night. The owner (which is also the mayor of that city now) knew the band was not from Rosarito Beach and he offered them a house to stay for the summer so they wouldn't have to return everyday to Tijuana (about 40 minutes away). This house is located at a beach community called 'Rosarito Shores' and since there was an extra room available, my mom said we could spend our summer weekends with her.

I thought I was going to have a great time, being the house near the beach and all that... But it never happened. The first night, a loud knocking woke me up and I soon realized it was coming from the kitchen. My brother was sleeping next to me so I assumed my mom was back and I went over there to greet her, I freaked out when nobody was home but the knocking was still there!

I tried to find an explanation but we didn't share walls with the neighbors and I clearly heard as if someone had moved a chair from the dining room! That creeped the heck out of me and I rushed back to the room where my brother was still sleeping. As soon as my mom was home I told her what happened but she didn't believe me and I had to stay there for the whole weekend listening knocks, chairs moving and sometimes I heard whispers outside the room.

Even in broad daylight I heard a dish crushing on the floor just behind me. That killed my naive idea that ghosts and paranormal events could only happen at night.

Needless to say, I did not step a foot on that house again and spent a relaxed summer at my aunt's. The beach community is still there, and you can catch a strange vibe even if you're only driving by because a lot of its previous occupants were elderly people who, according to maintenance staff, died in their houses. I suppose death did not keep them from hanging out at their old place.

Vortex in a Bank,"California, United States",Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: Vortex in a Bank

T his ordeal happened two years ago when I was in my freshman year of high school. My mom has always had stressful jobs, but one year right before Thanksgiving she got laid off from her government job because they were downsizing staff. This dealt a heavy blow to her because she was dealing with false accusations from her employees. So, needless to say, she was down and depressed. A few months later, she was hired to work for a bank, but since the position for manager was not open, she reluctantly accepted working as a teller.

Before I even go into telling what happened, I need to describe the look of the bank and the kind of people that worked there. The suburb that this building is located in is known for great landscaping. However, if you start driving down the street that passes by the bank, the plants and trees look like they are about to croak. This is especially true around the bank itself. I can't count how many times I've seen gardeners tear out half-dead plants and replace them with new ones, only to see them die about a week or so afterward. The inside of the bank looks as if it has stayed the same since they first built it: ugly, foul-smelling carpet, wood paneling on the walls, and outdated furniture. The other employees who worked there, including my mom's boss, were extremely negative people and seemed to enjoy backstabbing each other. One in particular was caught several times filching money from the cash vault.

Meanwhile, I was dealing with the problem of adjusting to a new school. I made a few friends, including a senior girl whose mom works as a reflexologist and a psychic. Because of the friendship I had with her daughter, this woman offered me rides after school and had let me stay at their house until Dad picked me up late in the evening. Naturally, as I got to know her, she started telling me about spirits, guardian angels, past lives, and all that. At the time, I was rather skeptic, so I would be polite and do the classic listen-and-occasional-nodding-of-the-head trick.

Mom started coming home complaining about work. She has always had the habit of venting about work while she and I are in the car together during the weekends. However, each story she told was stranger than the next. They first started out as things like the other employees suddenly falling down and being nasty to each other. But soon she was telling me stories like this: A customer walked into the bank to make a deposit in her checking account. As she stepped up to the counter, she froze and starting shivering. Mom asked her what was wrong, and the woman replied saying that she suddenly felt extremely cold. This was odd because when they checked the thermostat, it read that the room temperature was 75. The woman said that she would come back and make the transaction later that day. She never did.

Another was when Mom was in the restroom. She couldn't go into the stall closest to the door because all it had as far as toilet paper was the brown roll. When she walked into the second stall, the door slammed behind her and locked her in. As she tried to get the door to open again, she could hear the toilet paper roll in the other stall, as if someone was spinning it on the rod with a finger. She was forced to crawl underneath the stall to get out. She did not waste time in leaving the bathroom.

Still another was when she carried papers down to the basement. According to her, that basement was the most haunted thing in the building. I never ventured down there (she wouldn't let me), but she said that even the feeling you get from being down there is evil. The ceiling was always leaking, and off in one of the corners was a dead potted plant. Not even the leaves were left; it just looked like a big stem that was sticking up from the soil. There was a small card table nearby it. When she set the heavy crate of papers on the floor, her back started to ache, so she sat down at the table. She rested there for a while, and then she felt as if someone was trying to pull the chair out from underneath her. She screamed and ran upstairs.

There are many others that she told me about: more customers feeling cold and frightened, faint laughter coming from the basement, and insects flying in through the door, landing somewhere, and dying. What was amazing was that the other employees did not notice anything.

Because the place was so trashed, Mom was making the effort of cleaning things up. At some point she got rid of the dead plant. From then on, things got worse. She and several people started feeling sick, and she was having dreams about a barn being burnt to the ground.

One afternoon, the lady who was giving me rides said that she would like to meet my family. I told her what bank Mom was working at, and so we drove over there to say 'hi'. As we waited in line, the bank manager came in though the front door. I watched her. Just as she started complaining up a storm, she fell down to the floor. To my astonishment, the way she fell did not look like she had tripped. It looked as if someone had grabbed her leg and tried to pull her down. The woman I was with saw this as well. After she and Mom had a friendly conversation at the counter, she invited us over for dinner.

That evening, Mom told her everything she told me. The lady suggested that there is a vortex in the bank, possibly created by someone dying in the barn fire. She said that it was feeding on the negative energy being sent out by the bank's employees, and that removing the dead plant was what made the spirits upset. She told Mom that she would be able to protect herself if she wore an amethyst necklace or even just a small bead of it in her pocket. It did help, but customers were still experiencing things as they came in.

Mom was telling me that what she noticed about the strange activity was that it seemed like things children would do: spinning toilet paper rolls and pulling chairs from underneath people. I joked, 'Yeah, they're ghost children who are upset because they did not get candy when they wanted'. To my amazement, Mom said that maybe it wouldn't hurt putting out little bowls of old-fashioned jellybeans, peppermint sticks, chocolate kisses, and licorice. She placed a bowl on each desk there, and there were no longer any reports from customers. But what was rather interesting was that within weeks, the other employees were fired by the people in charge of the bank branches in the district.

What happened next made me lose my skepticism. I was home alone one morning, and I was in the bathroom brushing my teeth. All of the sudden, I felt a gust of wind around my ankles. This wind was so strong that it caused my hair to fly up. I looked over at the window above the toilet and was shocked to see it closed. My bathroom door was also closed. At the moment, I just shrugged it off.

All throughout that day, however, objects kept falling off of shelves and walls. In our living room, we have a large framed painting that hangs on the wall above our couch. I was napping on that couch until the picture fell right on top of me. The books I had on a shelf in my room were tumbling off and crashing onto my desk. When I saw that happen, I heard someone laughing. Our cats were behaving strangely as well.

When Mom came home that evening, I told her what happened. She began to freak out and say that 'they' followed her home. This time, instead of buying candy (since she knew that Dad would eat it all in one night), she went to the toy store and bought a little doll that had a frilly blue dress and tiny black shoes. She laid it next to the lamp in our living room. A few nights later, while I was lying in bed, I saw in the darkness a bright blue light, about the size of a tennis ball. It floated there for a few moments before it zipped off and faded into nothing.

I'm not sure if that last part is related to the rest of the story, but we did not experience anything else after that.

She Saw a Clown,"Michigan, United States",Non Human Entities,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Non Human Entities :: She Saw a Clown

T his happened in the same house as in The Basement Dancer . It was 1989 I believe at around 9:30pm-10:00pm and everyone in the house was was already settled in except for my two oldest sisters (13-14) they were getting ready for bed and were the bathroom which had a connecting door to the basement near the toilet. My oldest sister was actually using the restroom while the other was brushing her hair.

Well, as she was doing that she heard a strange noise coming from the basement. (see she was the one that actually told me this story. I was too young to remember anything) She asked my oldest sister if she heard the noise and she said yes. So then she walks over to the basement door and opens it slowly. She peaked her head around the corner to see the most chocking thing that she has ever seen. She told me she saw this person or demon crawling up the stairs like how a baby would, dressed in this clown suit, holding what looked like a knife in his hand. She told me it was like a dwarf because it was smaller then a midget. She gasped and could not move. When she did that it looked up at her with this ""freaky"" grin then put the knife in its mouth and started up the steps more quickly stumbling and catching its toes on each step because of how short it was. She could still not move but was making a hesitant sound that scared my oldest sister that then grabbed her arm but could not move her as if she was transfixed on the demon by a force.

Just about near the top she then let out a scream. She then told me that the ""thing"" stopped, stood up on the steps to then laugh at her sounding like a child. Then he fell backwards falling on the steps with dead weight looking like a person with no control of there limbs. She was then pulled into the bathroom with the door shutting hard.

My dad heard the scream and came to the bathroom. They told them what happened and he went downstairs to find what they saw. He could not find anything that resembled what they told him.

The Floating Head,"Arizona, United States",Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: The Floating Head

I was visiting my dad in Nevada and were speaking of the time he found a human head in the trash can in front of his house. We were talking about hauntings and the weird experiences that we had all experienced in our life. I had always known about this strange find since I was much younger. It wasn't until just recently I really slammed my dad with questions. He started to tell me about that hot day here in Arizona where he was born. He would always be playing ball in the street. My dad at the time was 13 old enough to remember detail.

The ball was whacked straight past him and hit the trash can in front of his house on the street and back in those times, like everyone had in front of their homes was the old style trash cans, the metal ones, not very tall, that have the lid you remove on and off, well as my dad approached the trash can, like all kids, he peeks inside the uncovered can as he reaches for the ball, habit I guess, being that you can find lots of cool treasures when you're a kid as he always did. He did a double take not believing what he saw, he stops and thinks for a moment before taking another look telling himself ""was that what I think it was"" and behold it was.

It was very identifiable that it was a human head, not to mention the head of his neighbor whom was a nice Indian lady that lived there for some time. My dad was in total shock as to what he saw and didn't even tell his friends, he ran straight to the front porch of his house yelling for his mom, my grandma, of what he had seen. Of course she didn't believe him thinking he was a clown and would sometimes do funny things to trick my grandma, so after following her around the house, stating his truth, she finally became irritated, claiming this better not be one of your little jokes son, I am busy and have no time for games right now.

Well she then thought that this was a first claiming to see a head of the neighbor in the trash ""hmmm, this sounds too weird"" so she follows him down the steps to the trash can and there, she saw their neighbors decapitated head in the can. In shock my Grandma pretty much became light headed and just about fainted. She was able to make it back into the house with my dad's help and they called the authorities and they were there pretty quick.

They kicked the door down to their neighbors home and found her boyfriend in there and her body lying in the tub. This guy was nuts and acted as if nothing happened and that he still sleeps with her as if she were in one piece. He told the authorities that she was taking a bath getting ready for bed, apparently he would sleep next to this body with no head.

After that fiasco my dad and grandma would have these experiences that would not end. My dad claims that this really freaked him out finding such a find, either way he said the visions would not stop. He constantly would wake up at night hearing this lady call his name S-T-E-V-E through out the house. I asked him if he were dreaming and he said ""honey no I was not"". For one I could hardly sleep for a long while after that find so close to my home and it took a lot to get me to sleep, and when all this occurred I was wide awake. He claimed the head would float around the house and his mother saw it too she was totally freaked by this and really didn't know what to do.

Night by night for two weeks, they would see this same image as if looking for something or some one. Not meant to be funny here but obviously I think she was looking for her head or body and maybe knowing my dad was the one that found it, she probably just focused on him not to sure but these awful visions were to much for my grandma to take and within a 3 week period, they moved away from that house.

The constant sounds at night and during the day, the light sound of someone calling their name was too much for here. All I can say is thank goodness they caught that weirdo and probably who knows, to date he may have died in prison I hope. I often think poor lady she must wonder around still looking for peace.

"Two Spirits, One Good, One Bad",Canada,Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: Two Spirits, One Good, One Bad

H ey everyone, I submitted two stories that happened about me and my aunt back when I was young (and as usual I'm not good with my english) one about Tanniq and one about the Evil Entity , here's one when we lived in a two story house in Rankin Inlet (a town we are currently living in).

For about nine years my family and I lived in a two story house, many things happened in that house. When we first moved in, my brothers were playing and running around seeing who was the fastest going up and down the stairs. They both slipped on the last stairs laughing (they were sitting or laying on the stairs I forgot) when they looked up they saw a person looking at them, this person or spirit must have been curious on making all that noise (just so you know there was no one up stairs, everyone was down, and let me describe the house to you, when you go in there is a living room connected to the kitchen, a small storage room beside the stairs and a furnace room beside the storage room. Going up the first stairs the bathroom in on the first landing and up the stairs are three rooms and a small storage area, hope you understand what I just described there) my brothers told everyone what they saw, so my parents told them not to be scared of anything that can't hurt them, my brothers weren't scared or anything because they were kind of on the sensitive side, especially the older one (but still my little brother which I call little big brother now because he got taller then me)

The room me and my sister were sleeping in was not the settling type of room you would want to sleep in (same two story house we lived in once, three bed rooms, one across the room on in the middle and one in the right) The room in the right was the room we were sharing.

One night my sister was going to sleep early, my brothers, me and my baby sister were watching t.v in the living room downstairs, until we heard Molly crying (that's her real name) I went upstairs to see what happened, the lights were on and molly was on the bed crying, I asked her what happened but she didn't respond, I asked her again and she said that someone was scratching on her back, I checked her back to see any scratch marks but there was nothing, so I told her to come downstairs and sleep there instead because she didn't want to be alone upstairs by herself. After she fell asleep in the living room on the couch with my baby sister I told my brothers and my parents what happened.

In the same room one night my sister and I couldn't fall asleep because for some reason my right arm would move on its own without me controlling it to lift up, I told molly and she was scared (I didn't want to tell her but in my family we tell the truth on what happens) so we went to my brothers' room to ask them if they can sleep with us that night and they agreed. We put their bed side ours so they have something to sleep on, JD (short for is full name) was sleeping beside me and my other brother was sleeping with my sister, when I fell asleep, JD woke me up and told me my arm lifted up by it self again, I kind of got frustrated and said ""F**k sakes man, stupid arm"" and went back to sleep on the arm that's been lifting its self up.

The room on the right was the same room my sister and I slept in, every time we went in there we felt some what uncomfortable, every night I would feel someone watching me, an uncomfortable feeling that you can't shake off. The door is always closed and the light's off, the only light was the alarm clock. One night my sister fell asleep before me because we would talk for about an hour before going to bed. As I lay on the bed waiting for sleep to take me to dream land, I suddenly heard a scream in my right ear. I was laying down on the bed unable to move because I was paralyzed with fear. I looked at my sister, she was still sleeping knowing that I was the only one that had heard it, I prayed to god for protection after sensing a unsettling feeling that something was going to happen to me when I fall asleep. Feeling safe once again I was able to sleep in the arms of my guardian angel, I wanted to cry because I sensed this peace when one of my relatives was still alive, but I know that they didn't want to see my shed a tear so I held it in and fell in to dream land.

My sister and I asked our parents to move into their old room because they always slept in the living (my baby sister cried every night in there old room, after sleeping in the living room she didn't cry as much) they asked why and we told them what happens in the room Molly and I shared, so they agreed to let us move our belongings to the room they once slept in be for adopting my baby sister. My little brother stewart (his real name) moved to that room finally about to have is own room, nothing happened to him when he slept there, the room my sister and I moved into (the one across from the stairs) we were finally able to sleep better from the first night of moving to this house we are living in right now. Although my little brother's behavior changed when he moved to the room on the right, he doesn't listen to my parents as much as he did before, he gets angry at little things and start arguments, he would be with the wrong people that he isn't allowed to be with and sometime violate properties which he never did before moving to that room. He would think that we're blaming things on him when we're just explaining things to him what he should and shouldn't do, my parents explains everything to us when we are listening but he thinks otherwise.

One day my dad was home alone, everyone was out except for him. On that day my dad was sitting on the couch, there was some show on the television when he felt a presence beside him, he turned his head, he saw my mom sitting beside him and staring at him, he was not scared or anything but just stared back at the image of my mom which he knew it wasn't her. When my mom came back home, my dad told her what happened and my mom told us what my dad told her.

JD is the sensitive one in the family so he hears and sees some things that we cannot. Almost every night he would hear footstep coming up the stairs or going down when everyone is asleep, see someone standing by the stairway looking at him and sometime feels it. When I had my first digital camera I took a picture of my brother laying down on the couch playing with his gameboy advance, in the picture it showed him playing and an orb right above is stomach, we were kind of shocked to see our first orb. I showed my brother the orb and told us that he felt someone sitting on his stomach when no one was near him, he wasn't afraid and thought nothing of what ever it was sitting on hime. I showed the image to my parents and they thought nothing of it, we lived in that house for such a long time that it doesn't bother us much.

When my cousin Jason was living with us for a few months he was sleeping in the room on the right, the room didn't bother him or anything (I just started thinking that spirit didn't like girls at all). His girlfriend and another cousin named Doreen were visiting him. Doreen didn't tell me this but since she's one of my favorite cousins, I believe her. She told me when she was sitting on the bed talking to Jason and his girlfriend she saw someone behind the door, a shadowy figure stared at them mainly at Doreen, the door was open because my mom wanted to door open so nothing nasty can happen (if you know what I mean *yuck*), the shadowy figure was just staring and then disappeared. Doreen was kind of scared after what she saw, also told me that it didn't feel right when it was there. What ever it was didn't really like girls at all and just makes its presence known to the females in the room that it didn't like them. I had some of my friends over and talk about what they have been doing after school and such, when one of them told me that they didn't feel so good, so I had the idea of going downstairs instead, when we left the room, my friend felt ok again and we didn't go into the room for the again for the whole day.

My uncle Floyd and his girlfriend were house sitting when my family and I were visiting our relatives in chester. While they were house sitting the first night sleeping in my parents room, my uncle woke up from his girlfriend talking to someone, she was talking to someone in innuktitut, my uncle asked her who she was talking to, she replied that there's someone sitting on the floor, an old man. Floyd said that there was no one there but she said that the old man is sitting right beside the bed and talking to her. When the old man disappeared in front of Floyd's girlfriend she got kind of scared and forced herself to sleep with my uncle, the next day they slept at my grandma's house instead because they were scared of what my uncle's girlfriend experienced. When we came back from Chester, Floyd and Tiff (let's just call her that) told us what she saw and talked to, we weren't really bothered because in the room they were sleeping in was comforting and peaceful. I know the old man that was in that room died in there and doesn't want to cause any harm to anyone.

In this same room a few of my brothers friends, my sister and a few of my cousins were watching a movie called 'Cabin Fever'(I heard it was scary and disgusting so I didn't plan on watching the movie) during the movie one of the people felt the bed move down, she/he looked to see if anyone was sitting beside that person but found out that no one was there. Another thing happened in when they were still watching the movie, one of our guest felt someone tap him/her on the shoulder on either side of his/her shoulder but they said that they didn't do anything while watching the movie, that person got kind of scared and decide to watch and ignore the whatever happened.

This is all the story I know that had happened in the house I lived in with my family, stories I heard my brothers, sister, parents, cousins and friends. This is the longest story I have wrote and my hands are killing me from typing this story, I hope you have enjoyed this story as much as what happened in the old two story house we lived in.

Haunted Castle Leslie,Ireland,Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: Haunted Castle Leslie

I am 26 years old now and this incident happened on the night of my 20th birthday, in Castle Leslie, Glaslough, County Monaghan, Ireland. At the time this happened, Castle Leslie was a small hotel featuring, I believe, eight bedrooms. Each room had a theme and was decorated accordingly. Our room for the night was the ""Nursery"" which was located on the third (top) floor and had a bay window that overlooked the small lake. The room and view were beautiful, and our bathroom was actually a large dollhouse.

What made Castle Leslie different from most other hotels or bed and breakfasts is that the guest was entitled to have free reign throughout the castle and grounds. One only saw or spoke to the staff when they were called upon. There were telephones located around the castle for this purpose.

As I said before, it was the night of my 20th birthday. My mom and I had a fabulous dinner and she had retired early to our room. I was still so excited about being there that I could not sleep and I wanted to explore the castle. I had bought a nice cuban cigar earlier at dinner (this is a big deal because I am American, and the United States has trade embargos against Cuba) and wanted to smoke it in the drawing room, which was the only room in the castle where one was allowed to smoke.

Well, the staff, who had their own living quarters in a separate part of the house, had gone around and turned off all of the lights, leaving the castle pitch black. I had to stumble around the confusing layout by memory turning on lights as I went down from the third floor to the first floor. I stopped halfway on the stairs to call the staff and ask them to turn off the motion alarm so that I could go smoke. I was informed that they had not set the alarm, and to go on.

I slowly made my way through the hallway, into the huge dining room, turning on lights as I went. Downstairs, the staff had closed the huge floor-to-ceiling shutters from the inside and the doors separating the rooms were all closed. It was pitch black as I entered into the drawing room. This room was as long as the dining room and furnished with, among other things, a black grand piano, several couched with tables for reading and various ""museum"" pieces like photographs and antiques.

As I said, I opened the door and felt along the wall until I found the light switches. I turned one set on, illuminating the room enough to see clearly. I crossed the room and sat in a pleasant chair with my back to the side wall. From this vantage I could see the fireplace in front of me and slightly too my right. I lit up my cigar and casually glanced at the fireplace, and I saw a light flickering in the glass, like a reflection. I got up from my chair and looked around to where I thought the light was coming from and found to my complete amazement, a white candle in a brass holder with a handle, flickering on top of the piano.

When I got to the candle, I noticed that it had just been lit, there was no wax drippings. Also, besides it being pitch black when I had entered the room, the staff would have been positively fired had they left an unattended candle burning amongst all the old woodwork and curtains. I blew the candle out and sat back down in the chair to finish my cigar.

The experience was not at all frightening. Rather it made me feel comforted and smile. Castle Leslie is noted as being a haunted location in Ireland. One of the young men who had lived there was Shane Leslie, and he died in a war far away and can still be seen standing on the shore of the lake.

I do not know if it was Shane that lit the candle for me, but I feel that it was lit for me because it was so dark, and the ghost wanted me to find my way.

If I Had Said Yes to the Ghost Nurse,"Georgia, United States",Apparitions / Voices / Touches,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Apparitions / Voices / Touches :: If I Had Said Yes to the Ghost Nurse

T his amazing experience occurred when I was about three or four years old, years before what happened to me in my other story, The Presence , and in a different apartment. We lived in a pretty bad neighborhood at the time. Many people died there from shootings, stabbings, and the such. This is a bit of a tangent but it helps to show how dangerous the neighborhood was.

On a certain night, my cousins were visiting and we were watching t.v. When we heard the doorbell ring. Considering how dangerous the neighborhood was, my mom motioned for us all to become silent while she peered out the peep-hole to see who was at the door. I, being young and stupid, peeped out of our big front window which was next to the door. What I saw was a man dressed all in black standing at our door with a knife in one hand and a gun in the other. My mom quickly motioned for me to get out of the window and I did before the guy could see me. He eventually left leaving us unharmed. Thank God! Now back to the main story.

This apartment had a long staircase that led upstairs to three bedrooms and one bathroom. The bathroom was on the immediate left while the three bedrooms were to the right on alternating sides of the hallway. Being young and afraid of the dark, I would sometimes sleep with my mom. On this particular night, I woke up beside my mom finding myself in need of a bathroom. It was eerily dark and silent that night so I figured that I'd go do my business as quickly as possible and then run back in bed with mommy. I stepped out into the hallway and made my way to the bathroom. Before reaching the bathroom, one would have to pass by the staircase. As I did, I saw something that was the beginning of an experience I don't think I'll ever forget. Coming silently up the stairs toward me was a young blond nurse. She was pushing one of those hospital emergency beds and upon it was the figure of a person covered from head to toe with a white sheet. Mind you, these beds usually have wheels that should squeak and generally make a lot of noise hitting the steps when pushed up a staircase. However, the bed made no sound at all as she wheeled it up to me! When she came near enough to speak with me (oddly, I don't remember feeling fear while I spoke with her, only curiosity) she said something that has horrified me ever since I could remember it.

Now, I had no intention of ""keeping a body"" for anybody so I responded very plainly.

The nurse again asked, ""Will you keep this body for me?"" and I again said, ""No..."" I got the feeling that she wanted to go somewhere and leave the body with me but I also got the feeling that If I kept it there was no assurance that she would return to get it back.

We repeated this a few times-the nurse asking me to keep the body and me firmly refusing.

Finally, the nurse said something like, ""I'll show you,"" as she lifted the white sheet of off the face of the body. What I saw immediately replaced my curiosity with terror. I saw a bloody face so disfigured with cuts and bruises that I think an immediate family member would have a hard time recognizing it.

After showing me this, the nurse had the nerve to ask me one more time , ""Will you keep this body for me?""

At this, the nurse somehow wheeled the bed around and began to walk down the staircase without a sound until she reached the bottom and disappeared.

I don't remember if I used the bathroom after but I do remember jumping back in bed with my mom and cuddling next to her for the rest of the night. I told my mom and she thinks that the nurse possibly could've been someone who was murdered in the apartment considering how dangerous the neighborhood was.

I am not known to be one who makes up things like this and, seriously, how could a toddler come up with such a vivid and disturbing story? To this day I don't understand why the nurse wanted me to keep the body and I still wonder what would have happened if I had said yes...

If anyone has any thoughts or ideas that could answer these questions I'd really like to know!

Sensitive Brother,Canada,Psychic / Medium,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Psychic / Medium :: Sensitive Brother

H ey everyone, I submitted maybe three stories already in this web site. What I would like to tell you is about my brother JD (nick name because his name was kind long so I kind of gave him the nickname) that experience most of these things then any of my family.

When my little brother JD was young, everyone was at the health center because a family member just died from a heart attack. I forgot what year and month it was but I know it was during winter. Me and my brother were beside my mom and dad who was crying, also the rest of my relatives were crying (who wouldn't). I looked at my brother who was also crying because my grandmother named him after her favorite niece that was abused and treated badly by her relatives, except for my grandmother. Many years later, my brother told my parents that he saw my grandmother's soul standing beside her husband on the day of her death then looked at him with a gentle smile which he knew right away that she was going to be ok.

On a summer day we heard news of my aunt's death, my mom was crying, already missing her sister and never had a chance to say goodbye, I was beside my dad crying and also my baby brother was crying and JD as well. JD told us that he knew our aunt died since he saw my aunt one night looking at him or something like that (we lived in Chesterfield Inlet back then and my aunt lived in Rankin Inlet). My aunt was a alcoholic and spoiled me when I go and visit my relatives in Rankin (I get home sick if one of my parents weren't with me). I kind of sense that she wasn't going to be in this world any more but my brother knew what he saw on the night of her death. My aunt died from drowning, she was drunk that night, fell off a honda and her face on in a puddle, her body was found the next day by a local person that lived close to where her body was found.

Once a year, most of the town's people would go fishing to see who can catch the largest fish, they would go to different areas out side of town by machine or go catch cod in the bay. In this particular area which I forgot the name of the lake was, my family went to go fishing there about two or three years ago, my brother was at the fishing hole and saw a shadowy figure standing on the land on top of the hill just staring at them. These figure didn't bother anyone because the fishing durby would only last for two days on the weekend, he told my parents what he saw and they believed him because that land is haunted by someone that once died there years ago. When they came home my brother told me and I asked my parents if it's true and they said yes.

Just last year during winter, my dad was in the drunk tank because he can't really control himself when he's high on liquor. My mom was crying and prayed to god for protection and hoping that everything will be alright, she felt this overwhelming sense of peace and comfort that washed over her while she was crying. My brother looked over to her and saw my deceased grandmother glowing in heaven's light, her arm was over my mother's shoulders and saying to her that everything will be ok in innuktitut. JD told mom what he saw and told her what my grandmother said. I went home from my other grandmother (my mom's mom) when I went into the house I felt safe, a sense of peace and happy that I was able to sense a familiar presence once again, which I know was my grandmother's. JD told me what he saw and heard from my deceased relative and I was happy (and kind of jealous of him :P) that I heard it from him.

This is all the stories I know what my brother saw and heard. The rest I submitted on one of the stories called two spirits, one good, one bad he still experiences something which I know he aint' going to tell me anytime soon.

I was inspired to tell this story that had the same experience as my brother did, kujannami (thank you) melisa123.

The First Time I Saw a Ghost,"Louisiana, United States",Family / Friends Visits,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Family / Friends Visits :: The First Time I Saw a Ghost

I remember the year our Father died, 1976, and the family rode the greyhound bus to Louisiana from North Carolina, our Mom, my twin Sister, and two Brothers. There he had lived with our Grandparents up to his death. After his funeral and, fresh out of high school, it was time to think about my future. My Grandmother asked me to stay with her and Grandfather, and take my Dad's old room, and I did.

Months later I was in bed asleep, lying on my back, with my right arm extended over my head. It was a very relaxed position when I was awaken by pressure in the pit of my right arm, it was felt like a fist of a small person. Surprised and confused I looked around the room there were no one in the room. I then opened the bedroom door and looked into the living room to make sure that there weren't anyone there. Convinced that everything was ok I closed my bedroom door then back to bed.

At three o'clock that morning my eyes suddenly popped opened, I thought it was very strange, until I looked down at my feet and the bedroom door was wide opened, and standing there was a dark shadow of a man, directly in the door way. The street lights in front of the house had brightly lit the large living room, and there was no doubt this was the ghost of my father looking me in the face.

Until that point my thoughts has always been once you are dead, you are gone, no ghost or spirits GONE. I was very wrong.

Something that Follows Me,"New York, United States",Psychic / Medium,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Psychic / Medium :: Something that Follows Me

W hen I was younger I thought I was different. I would dream up things that would happen years later. As I got older I started feeling as if someone was always walking with me. When I got married, I lived in Brooklyn at 301 Cooper Street. One day me and my husband were talking and I was telling him that when he wasn't home, my air conditioner would turn on and off. He dismissed my claims and said I was bugging out. As soon as he said that, we both felt a chill and the bathroom sink turned on by itself. We were both standing by the bathroom and no one was in the bathroom so it freaked us both out. Then we broke up, I moved to Queens to 106-10 101 Avenue and funny things would happen there too.

I told my new boyfriend not to worry, I had a ghost that has been following me for years. He did not believe me. One day I went to work as normal and he came running to my job and said that the lights started turning on and off and my stereo started playing gospel music. He said he then unplugged the radio and it turned back on. Right now my daughter is starting to see the spirit and it freaks me out because she was never told of the spooky stuff that happened to me and she has been explaining to me things I've seen before.

I just put her to bed and she was screaming and I went up stairs and asked her what was wrong? She just told me the spirit went in the closet to the room in the attic. We have been in this new house in Millerton, N.Y. today 1 week and no one knew there was a door in her closet to the attic, until just right now when I moved the furniture that was blocking that door!

I haven't moved anything in her closet since we moved in I haven't been in there. There was furniture in there I said I would get to when I wasn't busy this week. Now I'm spooked completely. I need help!

Karma,Australia,Misc,"M y name is Michelle Copelan. I am 17 years old and have recently discovered a little south African looking boy hovering around my house. It's really scary, I have tried talking to him but everytime I go near him, I get a weird vibe. I was too afraid to stay at home so I went to my boyfriend house & stayed there for a week.

I left my dog at my neighbors' house and asked them to look after him. When I returned home, to my shock, my neighbors broke the bad news to me, they quoted ""Musty is dead"". We took him for a walk and something spooked him, he freaked and fell to the floor, took him to the vet but they said it was too late. We asked what was wrong but the Veterinarian said that they couldn't find anything wrong.

It was a surprise. I was in tears for days and knew that the little boy had something to do with it. 4 days later I returned to the house, by myself. I was thinking positively until I felt a shrug on my pants. It was the little boy, he said sorry for everything that he caused, but it's Karma, I deserved it.

I blame everything that has happened on myself, everyone tells me I shouldn't but I think I should, I took an innocent little dog's life. I was thinking about myself not my gorgeous Musty (R.I.P).

But that wasn't the last time I had seen him, the story continues one night I went to pack all my stuff, I needed a holiday, I needed to get out. I was packing my things when I hear a yelping noise. Musty I thought? It couldn't be. I ran to the dripping noise, it was in the bathroom, I opened the curtains and there was the ghost of musty lying in the bath trying to get out, and of course with his tennis ball in his mouth.

I just stared and cried with happiness, I knew he would be okay. In my perspective. I love him, I miss him. But you must know...

Headless Man,Philippines,Apparitions / Voices / Touches,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Apparitions / Voices / Touches :: Headless Man

I was in the philippines when my story happened, but I'm now living in chicago. It was a rainy, dark afternoon when my sister and I were watching jeepers creeper (I still remember the movie!) and it was only me and her because our parents were both at work. I was young probably like 8 years old. The house that we used to live in was my great-grandfather's house, it was passed to my grandfather and he allowed us to live there which means the house was really old. We were watching the movie in our parents' room which was connected to my sister's room. My parents' door is not made of wood, half of it was made of wood and screen, which we could see my sister's room. We turned on the light, the other room was a little bit dark but I could still see it because the windows were opened.

I was sitting on the bed while my sister was sitting on the floor. Right next to my sister was the door which directs to her room. I looked at her room and there was a man on the bed and next to it was a side table where there was a head (it was just the head)... I got soooo scared! I told my sister if we could go to our cousin's house and just stay there until our parents are home. She said why I looked so afraid, I said nothing because I did not want to freak her out since that it was only me and her. I looked at it twice or maybe more than twice and it was still there, the worst thing was the head was spinning. I begged my sister if we can get out of this house right now because I'm really not feeling well.

So the next day I told my mom about it, but she did not believe me. I told that story to my cousins and they were so afraid and did not want to go back to that house and so did I...

A Father's Sign,"Ohio, United States",Family / Friends Visits,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Family / Friends Visits :: A Father's Sign

T his story happened shortly after the passing of my father. It was a very stressful time for my family and I. I was only 12 at the time and had to take over as the man of the house. Watching my younger brother and making sure he ate and bathed, things like that, while mom was at work, you know the responsible stuff. I had an older brother who was facing charges of assault with a deadly weapon for defending himself with a stick against another guy with a knife. Needless to say he both won and lost. He won the fight and lost his court case. But I am getting ahead of myself.

The morning my brother went to trial, I was left home alone with my younger brother. We had been outside most of the morning playing with friends from around the neighborhood. My brother, a friend and myself decided to go in and get something to drink, my brother and friend went outside to drink theirs while I remained inside to clean up the mess. As I was walking by a picture of my older brother that was sitting on top of the TV, I wondered how the trial was going.

Well wouldn't you know it, at that exact moment my brother's picture flew off the TV. It didn't fall from the TV, I watched it jump into the air and fly from it. Next thing I know, the oven door opened and closed on its own. Then a wind up song bird my father had bought for my mom began to play, this required that the bird be wound and a switch flipped to play.

I was the only one in the house at the time and I could see the bird and oven from where I was standing so I know no one living had done either. The bird suddenly stopped playing and the front door opened and closed. I thought it was my brother or my friend coming in, it was neither as they had left their glasses on the table outside and were in the alley playing.

I came to the only conclusion possible, that my father was letting me know that my brother was going to prison and that he would be watching out for him while he was there. Shortly after this mom called to let me know and I told her I already knew and explained what happened. Needless to say, she didn't believe me. I believe he was also there to say his good byes as my brother and I were never allowed in the hospital room with him while he lay dying. Some stupid hospital rule back then.

This story is for you Dad. Know that you are loved and missed greatly.

A Thing on a Bridge,Australia,Non Human Entities,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Non Human Entities :: A Thing on a Bridge

I live in the rural town of Port Hedland, Western Australia, and this is what happened on my walk. It was two Saturdays ago, on the 12th of August. I was walking alone at about 5:30 in the afternoon. I would normally have been walking my dog Charlie at this time, but she'd had an eye infection that kept her from sleeping and didn't seem up to the exercise.

Port Hedland is a coastal town near the northern end of Australia, and is prone to heavy rain from cyclones. The annual torrents require an extensive system of ditches running through the town to drain water off the roads. There also tends to be a lot of empty land between blocks of houses, massively overgrown with weeds that are only occasionally burned or trimmed away by the council.

I was walking along a narrow concrete bridge when I heard heavy breathing from the ditch below me. First I thought it was a drunk. Then I remembered the time I was jogging through a park (with my dog this time) and realized that I was running straight towards a large feral-looking mongrel dog, who was poking out of the yellow scrub and baring more and more teeth as I approached. We forget how close we are to nature.

I hurried along the bridge and looked under it after retreating to a respectful distance. There was nothing there. More relaxed and curious now, I walked back onto the bridge to ponder the origin of the sound. It promptly resumed. This time I boldly leaned over the railing and looked right under the bridge. Again I saw nothing more suspicious than empty faded beer cans. I straightened up, and stinking hot breath blew in my ear.

It was fear that I felt. Pure fear. Using some fancier word could only cheapen the experience. I fell back, facing the source of the breath. There was nothing I could see, but the heavy panting continued, and I was well familiar with that rotten-flesh smell unique to the breath of a dog on a bloody diet.

Before I'd even realized I should be getting up there was sudden invisible pressure on my chest. I expected paws, but did not quite feel them. Even now I can't quite discern the shape of the force that held me, whether I was restrained by paws, claws, hands or a flat slate.

Vicious howling erupted in front of me. Thoughts of the dog filled my mind, until I couldn't even see where I really was. That killer mongrel peeking his nose out of the bush, coolly deciding how close he would allow me to come before he lunged. Unable to think straight, I imagined that this was what was supposed to have happened, that I had fluked my way out of some cosmic debt and now the collector was knocking. Then it was gone. I didn't move for some time.

I wanted to go back there. It took me four days to get the nerve to actually do it, but I knew I wanted to go back. I thought about it for a while and decided everything needed to be the same. I arrived at the bridge at 5:30 the next Wednesday, walked to the centre, and waited. After minutes of nothing I realized what had drawn the thing to me. I began to picture the dog once more, remembered the lip pulling back and the stained points behind. As nothing continued to happen I realized what was different from the first time. The memory no longer scared me.

I've thought about this, and realized a few things. The first time I crossed the bridge something - not a ghost in usual terms, I have no reason to believe it was ever human - created the breathing sound that I was free to ignore or interpret however I wished. It was only after I returned that the breath resembled a dog's. I think the thing offered me a chance to show it what I feared, and I did. I can think of two reasons why it acted as it did. Perhaps it wanted to help me exorcise my demons, so to speak, or in some way it wanted my fear for its own reasons.

We forget how close we are to nature, but maybe some pat of nature needs us a little closer.

Thirsty Ghost,South Africa,Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: Thirsty Ghost

I was 9yrs old when I got sent to boarding school. We were Catholic so naturally the school of choice was a covent school in a little farming town about 2hrs away from home. The school was beautiful at the foot of a mountain with plenty of space for young kids to run around! It was pretty strict, we even had ""play uniform"" powder blue dresses that we wore after school when it was play time. Every Sunday morning it was church and we would walk in line with our white dresses and stockings looking like angels! I hated every minute of it but as the weeks went by I eventually got used to it.

The older girls would tell us ghost stories about the dead priests that walked around the rose gardens at night and about the groups of nuns that would chant their prayers on the sports field while we were all asleep. I didn't believe much because I had never had anything that had really scared me and I was never allowed to watch scary movies so I was actually clueless about these things.

One night I couldn't really sleep and was tossing and turning for at least an hour or two, then I happened to turn away from the wall and there on the side of my bed was a man, with a long beard looking at me. You would think that I would have screamed but I didn't feel any fear at all. He spoke to me and asked for a glass of water. I got out of bed, he had moved to the door, put on my gown, took my cup and started walking to the bathroom. I got the water and came back and he was gone. I took of my gown, got back into bed and fell asleep.

In the morning I wanted to tell our dorm mistress but for some reason when I saw her I had forgotten. That night he came again with the same request and again I did the same procedure but when I came back he was gone again. I think this happened for like a whole week until eventually I remembered to tell my friend and she totally freaked and told the dorm mistress who dismissed it and said that it was ""Jesus"" and not a ghost.

The following weekend my mother fetched me for a home visit and I told her what was happening... She took me out of the school with immediate effect.

Till today I do not understand whether I was being haunted or was it just a bad dream, but every morning when I woke up I would always have a cup of water on my bedside to show that I had gone to get the water and it wasn't for me because the cup was still full.

Black Magic,India,Apparitions / Voices / Touches,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Apparitions / Voices / Touches :: Black Magic

T his has been the most dreadful experience in my life. I had never imagined I would see such a day. Me and one of my friends used to go to private tuition in a quite remote place. I have always heard of black magic stories but always took them for a joke. My grandmother and my mum always said that many people practiced black magic in my locality.

On that particular day, we saw some ten rupees coins in the middle of a crossroad. At that time we of course didn't bother about silly superstitions. We both picked them up, and nothing strange happened to us on our way. But I didn't know what was waiting for me in my room. At night, around 9:30, I was combing my hair when I felt someone playing with my hair. I didn't bother about that and thought that I was imagining things. But then I saw a white woman looking dreamingly in the mirror!

When I talked about it to my mother she immediately called the priest who did many rituals with a yellow lemon which significantly turned in a reddish type of colour. Then he asked me whether my hair was loose or not. And effectively it was. He said that it followed me by holding my hair. Then I realized that the stories about roaming spirits that my grandparents and parents used to narrate were in fact true.

Friendly Ghosts,Cyprus,Apparitions / Voices / Touches,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Apparitions / Voices / Touches :: Friendly Ghosts

H i, name is Marie, I'm 24 and I live on an island in the Mediterranean called Cyprus. I've had many ghost encounters, so here are a couple. I was about 10 years old, I was sleeping with my night lamp on, as always, because I always used to be afraid of the dark. I opened my eyes and at my door there was a man standing and staring at me smiling, he was tall and transparent, this is all I remember about him, I wasn't scared at all and we looked at each other for about 2 whole minutes and then he glided away.

The next day my little brother, who was 8, told me that when he had gone to the bathroom the previous night, he had seen a tall man smiling at him and waving and then he disappeared. Nobody had passed away in our family during that period but spirits always passed through our house and our parents always believed us, because me and my brother always had the same stories for them in the morning.

Last year, when I was still living at my mom's, I woke up again in the middle of the night and felt a presence in my bedroom, I wasn't scared because, as I said, I'm used to paranormal stuff. He started messing with my stash of papers on my desk and playing with my heater, I was tired and sleepy so I told him to be quiet and he left and as usual, like all of them do, he went to my brother's room and did the same. In the morning there was police all over the street and an ambulance, it turns out my neighbor who was a detective had been discovered dead for 48 hours and he was just trying to tell us to go find his body :) poor guy!

Group of my Experiences,"Indiana, United States",Psychic / Medium,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Psychic / Medium :: Group of my Experiences

H ello there, I'm 19 years old and I'm going to tell you all of the experiences I've had so far as much as I can.

A very strange thing happened when I was born, during that year we had a drought, if anyone is from indiana reading this, ask around. It's true at least that's what my mom told me. When I was born, I was born dead, I had no pulse, no breathing etc, just as they were going to officially declare me dead, I started to cry and breath. They said I was going to show signs of brain damage and stuff like that. Nope, not that I know yet. The creepy thing is my mom has had tried to have a child. The first 3 before me, died and stayed dead. I was born and up to recently, there were SUPPOSED to be 3 after me and all died during birth.

A lot of weird things started to kick in when I was 5. We lived next door to my grandparents until I was 7 or 8 and I always, no matter what time it was, walked over to my grandma and grandpa's house and asked them for lemonade. Note: The house was no more than 4 feet probably away. Well one day my grandpa was taking the trash out, about 3 in the morning, and it was really foggy, all I had on was a shirt, and undies, haha. I followed him for some reason, and he told me. ""CJ stay on the side walk, if you stay there and be a good boy, you'll get some coffee..."" I stayed on the side walk about 2 minutes after my grandpa said it, a car came driving by really quickly. I just had this feeling to go inside. When I did, I found out BOTH of my grandparents were just getting up to make some coffee. I asked my grandpa how he got back in the house so fast. ""I never went outside. I need to take out the trash though..."" He went outside then came back inside. ""Thank you CJ for taking out the trash..."" I was just a little surprised at first I thought it was just weird.

This is a day I'll remember, because my grandpa, who I loved a lot, he was like my best friend that was just made for me. He was sick in the hospital and I had opened up my last present and we went to the hospital to check up on him and my uncle was taping the visit. I had gotten the Jurassic park T-rex with the loud roar. I had been playing with it to make it go ""RAWR"" and well when I got to my grandpa's room it suddenly stopped working. I went ""Grandpa watch watch!"" I kept trying to make it work... It didn't work until I left his room and then it went ""RAWR"". About May, my grandfather passed away. I never thought about anything until I looked at the tape my uncle had when I was like 15. There was a white figure standing by my grandpa's bed watching over him.

This is a day like my grandpa's visit stays in my head. This is because it was the day my grandma passed away. I was asleep but I had a dream that grandma was in a white room and my mom was crying. I woke up with the feeling like I was going to cry and my mom was sitting on my bed. ""Hey boo... I have some bad news, grandma just passed away an hour ago..."" I felt so sad then my mom went. ""CJ she said, listen to the song..."" My mom and I didn't know what she meant but it was okay. At my grandma's funeral song. It was ""holes in the floor of heaven"" my mom had picked it randomly, and I didn't listen to the lyrics. When it said about watching while tears fell down or something like that, I felt like a great burden was lifted.

We moved from the house next to my grandparents' to a house that had bug problems and a dark basement. That's where all of my experiences got bad. My mom had a boyfriend and he was into the pokemon card game that JUST came out. Well he was nice and bought like 60 packs. He went ""CJ pick any 5 packs you want..."" Okay I did and I got the Charizard, Alakazam, Blastoise, Venusaur, but the last pack scared me, because I pulled Gengar (which is a mischievous ghost), at that same moment I saw the card, there was a really loud bang from the basement. We all thought it was the heater.

After that day, I didn't really like basements but I was told to go into the basement to get something, I forget what it is now. I went down there, I felt like a lot of stuff was watching me, but when both of my feet left the last step, it felt like tremendous amount of pressure was put on my body and I couldn't move, nor yell. After a few moments I felt like I could move I ran up stairs and it felt like someone grabbed my ankle. I tripped up stairs. I got up, ran out and shut the door. I yelled to my mom that something was down there and she checked it was nothing. My mom said my pants must've got caught by a nail or something.

We moved out of that house and into another house up a hill near a forest, with lots of houses around. My mom dumped the boyfriend, got married and the guy already had a child. Well, I didn't get along with him but we were outside, and were going to head out back to play. We saw this, huge wolf dog pure snow white. We screamed, as I turned around my step brother was inside and he shut and locked the door on me. I ran from the dog/wolf around the house and my mom unlocked the door as I ran inside the dog/wolf wasn't there anymore. It was so strange because we checked for tracks and there wasn't any.

I moved in with my dad's house. I hate this house. To explain why I hate this house, I need to tell you what happened to me when I was 8 years old. I slept upstairs in a bed next to the doors, the stairs were creaky and you couldn't sneak up there, I don't care if you were like a expert ninja. I was asleep, then suddenly woke up as I felt a dark like pressure against me, a really bad sick feeling. As this man walked up the stairs with no sound what so ever, this man was in a black cloak, red eyes, was about 5'11 maybe 6'4', I don't know. It walked around the upstairs as it stopped in front of my bed. It looked straight at me, I was scared, I pulled the covers over my head and was just really scared as I closed my eyes, the covers in spots were thin, I could see a long arm being stretched towards me, I just suddenly passed out. I woke up and found out my aunt had made a black cloak. The thing is, I wondered where the spirit was.

At my dad's house I saw a lot of ghosts, which ranged from a black kitten to a little boy, to a little girl with a pink dress on. What happened a lot is there was a guy I called the walker. I didn't mind him. He just creeped me out because he was someone at 1 AM, who wore black outfit, and walked from my dad's front door to the kitchen. However, they were just not harmful. There were the goblins, I think, small little black spirits. My first encounter with one was in the kitchen, I flicked on the light and it poofed. They liked to open the bathroom door and such, harmless but annoying things.

I appreciate the time, thank you, comment, if you don't believe me that's fine. I'll be posting up the rest of my stuff later. I'm going to take a nap though.

Woman Outside my Bedroom Window,"Pennsylvania, United States",Apparitions / Voices / Touches,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Apparitions / Voices / Touches :: Woman Outside my Bedroom Window

I just recently moved from a rancher house in the middle of the country to the middle of a widely populated area. In fact, this is just about a month since I moved in. One night last week, I was getting ready to go to bed, and I just happened to look out my bedroom window (which is on the second floor) and I saw a woman dressed in a white wedding gown standing at the foot of the driveway (the area where the driveway meets the road) just staring at me! I stared at her back waiting for something to happen, but she just stood absolutely still and continued staring. I decided to ignore it, so I went to bed.

Then I woke up early the next morning, at around 3:30am and looked out my window again, and the woman was STILL THERE! And she was standing as still as she was earlier, just staring at me. I decided to call the police and when they came, the woman wasn't there. But they did feel a cool draft around the area she was standing, and it was a very hot night.

Also, a couple nights after that, I looked out my window again and saw the woman gliding in the circle of the culdesac and stopped at my driveway. She glanced up at me and began staring at me again. But this time, after about 10 seconds, she smiled, her eyes turned black and soulless, and she waved at me and vanished into thin air.

To this day, I have never seen that woman again, and I have no idea who she is. I asked neighbors around the culdesac but they said they never heard anything about who she was. However, one person who lived quite close to us, but not a neighbor, listened to my description of the woman and said that she was a bride-to-be who died in a terrible car crash on her way to her wedding several years ago.

And that scared me to death, because I had just then realized that I had actually seen a ghost.

Return of Jerry,"Colorado, United States",Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: Return of Jerry

I 'm centercore, and it's been a long time since I posted anything on this site. I've just been having lotsa fun the past handful of months with my girlfriend and had no weird experiences lately... until tonight.

Around 12:00, I thought I heard my mom upstairs messing with the trash to take it out. I went up there, she was in bed, and nobody was there. Around 12:30, started feeling weird, like something was in the room with me. The cat got all freaked out and acting scared, and I kept hearing noises. Upstairs. So I came back down, and then at almost 1:00 I started feeling weird again, then finally heard a cough, then saw the shadow on the stairs and chased it. Of course it got to the top before I could. Then I heard it running across the kitchen into the family room, and when I looked, it was dark (but it was all night, it's always dark in this house) and the deck light was on, and I saw most likely jerry standing there on the deck. He was just standing there staring at me, but I couldn't tell what I was seeing exactly, since I'm not tired. Only a little bit tired, but not much. He was almost transparent, and blurry. As I got closer, he just sorta evaporated into the air, and nothing's happened since. I'm just sitting here waiting to see or hear something once I'm tired. I'll post more later if it does.

It's been a long time since I've experienced this crap, so for it to start happening now is weird. I have no idea why this goes on, why this. Thing. Picks certain times to do it, but I don't think it'll ever make sense. I don't wanna call it a ghost cause then it just sounds like I'm making crap up, but I don't know what to call this thing, or how to describe it. It looks like a man, about my height, a little bit shorter, tanktop, camo pants, almost bald, gray skin, freaky looking dead eyes, and he coughs like a heavy smoker, and lately I been hearing sneezing too, which I don't understand.

He causes lotsa weird shiat to happen, like hallucinations that I see, or hear, that ain't there. Nothing's ever touched me, or tried to hurt me, its only things that I see, so I really don't get it. I've seen alterations in my reflection in the mirror before, sometimes I see myself as jerry, but then instantly I'm me again. Or I'll see jerry standing in front of the mirror, then he goes away in a split second. Or I see blood dripping down the walls, but it's only in the reflection. Or I see a hand reaching around the corner, usually if I'm on the phone, or if I'm really tired, like in sleep paralysis, I see jerry look in my room, he actually opens the door a little bit, it's totally dark, and looks in my room. And I know it's him, because if it was mom she'd come in, and wouldn't do it at like 4:00 in the morning. Plus I've seen what look like bodies hanging from the ceiling in the dark part of the basement, and at first they look like bags hanging but then I see more clearly. Then its like they just evaporate. Or I might see a face in some random spot, like in the wall, just staring at me, but its like blurry and then vanishes. Doesn't evaporate, just instantly vanishes...

I've also seen a face in the tv, like it'll go to static and this weird, freaky, messed up face appears, like all deformed. Then it just goes away and the tv stays on static for like maybe ten minutes then it starts to be ok again. Lights flicker sometimes when the weather is sunny outside, which I guess I can't say has anything to do with jerry, but I have had my possessions messed with before, like I'll find something in a different spot than where I left it, and I know it ain't mom doing it because she would have no reason to, and I'll find stuff that I've been missing for like four years, in a totally random spot, and sometimes files will be gone from my computer, sometimes I'll find some of my beverage gone, sometimes a light will turn on that I didn't turn on.

Sometimes a door will open on its own, I mean I don't see it open, or see the light turn on, I don't see any of these things happen, I find em that way...

Then there's the weird phone calls, where it rings and some random messed up numbers appear as the phone number, which I know can't be a phone number. Such as ""666"", or ""9"", or ""43.63.46.54.7465.745.7"", and the id does not keep track of the call either. And if I answer, it's either static or some weird voice saying some totally random crap and then it cuts off. Or sometimes I'll hear papers being rattled, or garbage bags upstairs, or my fan will be turned off the next morning, and I know it can't be a power outage or my clock would be messed up too. Which it won't be. Just the fan turned off. And sometimes my computer won't turn on, its like somebody's holding it and keeping it off somehow. Sometimes I think I hear somebody walking behind me up the stairs, or down the stairs, and then I see a shadow heading back up or down in the opposite way I came from. I chase it, and nobody's there...

If I don't find a way to get rid of this, I'll get real pissed, because this has been going on for almost my entire life. I'm totally used to it by now, but that don't make it any less messed up and disturbing...

A Ghost that Holds You Down,Philippines,Old Hags / Night Attacks / Sleep Paralysis,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Old Hags / Night Attacks / Sleep Paralysis :: A Ghost that Holds You Down

I t was about a month ago when it happened to me... It was 11:33pm, I was already asleep, the room was so dark without a light peeping in, it was really warm that night. When someone or something got on the bed. It stopped moving for 3 minutes thinking that I was awake. It moved again now it was creeping on my legs until it got to the side of my neck. My body temperature was rising really high, I was sweating. It stopped moving for 3 minutes and then it started... The force of it was so strong like a man was holding me down. I struggled to get up but it kept pushing me down into a position it wanted me in. I got forced to lying on my back flat on the bed with my hands set far apart also my feet apart.

When a beam of light peeped through the window, I saw a man's face so handsome and charming and the silhouette of his body. I saw his mouth on the side of my neck like he was licking it. His hand on my hips and his legs in between mine. He was like raping me in bed! The motion of his body was too rapid to handle, he kept pressing into my body trying to hold me down. When mother opened the door, he disappeared... I went back to sleep and ignored the violent ghost. It happened for a week. I couldn't tell it to my mother, it might shock her too much.

I told my friend about that night, he told me that it was just one of my unfulfilled desires in my dreams. I couldn't reply to his statement, he might think I'm a paranoid girl.

It happened again, sunday, it did the same thing but while he was licking my neck he talked...

His force got stronger, disabling me to move anymore. He then tried to lift up my shirt and pull down my shorts... I couldn't stand it until I subconsciously recited God's expelling prayer...

Me: God... Forgive this exiled soul for it has strayed and abused its second chance, let it rest in your ever eternally peaceful kingdom lay it to redeem for the next life...

The ghost started screaming, tossing and turning in pain while I was reciting that. Ever since that night it disappeared, I started to go to church more often for God's protection...

I appreciate a discussion about this violent and perverting ghost...

The Unknown,Poland,Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: The Unknown

H i it's me again. I wanted to write about some things that I heard of. When I was at my grandma's place we were watching a TV show about ghosts. I decided to tease my grandmother about ghosts. I actually did not believe in them (then). She kind of looked at me and said ""I believe in them"". I started to laugh a little bit and asked her ""how do you know?"" she replied saying ""because I saw one"".

She told me that when she was a kid she and her brother had to go to a german school during the 2 world war (she was lucky to survive). She and her brother had to walk through the park which basically was a forest. One day they were coming back from school and saw a polish soldier on a small hill on a horse. They wanted to wave to him but were scared that if a german would see them they would be shot at the spot. The soldier stared at them for a little bit and decided to go down the hill so my grandma couldn't see him.

A week later or something like that she was walking back from school when she noticed the man again. But he wasn't quite visible. She could see the face but not the legs of the horse. She felt scared and ran all the way home. She told her mother about this (my great grandmother) and she was a little surprised because all the polish soldiers were in camps or dead. My grandmother told her mother that the man had a scar on his head. My great grandmother heard this and turned white. She got a picture of a soldier from the kitchen and asked if that's him. She said yes and my great grandmother began to cry. My grandmother found out a few weeks later that the soldier was her uncle who died at the beginning of the war. My grandmother's brother saw him 3 more times during that time and even tried talking with the soldier. Her brother told my grandmother that just about 10 years ago but even after all this time he didn't want to talk about it.

Another weird story that has happened in my family was told to me from my step brother (he is a year younger then me). 2 years ago he moved to London, England to get a job. He rented a house with his friend and moved in. The owners of the house lived downstairs and my brother with his friend lived upstairs. For the first few weeks some weird things happened. They always heard noises but they thought it was nothing.

My brother knew something was wrong. Every time he woke up his door would be open. He noticed that some things would be misplaced. He later would find them in very weird places. One night he woke up and saw a shadow in his room. He thought it was his imagination and went to bed but he quickly woke up because he heard someone breathing and he could smell something nasty but nothing was in his room.

The next day he went to his friend's room to have a talk. He told her what happened and she said that there is something in the house and they knew it was a ghost. She told him that one day she was reading a book and felt that someone was by her bed. She couldn't see him but she knew he was there. She told him to go away. A few seconds later a bunch of paper flew up into the air and fell on the floor. She ran out of the room. They both decided to invite the owners for dinner and ask them if the place was haunted (they didn't want to use exactly those words). The owners told them that they never heard anything about that but they did say that they have ben playing the Ouija board for almost a year. My brother was freaked and moved back to Poland. His friend stayed in London but moved out of the house very shortly after my brother moved out.

Another weird thing happened to me not long ago but I think I will write about it next time.

"The Two Little Boys of Williamsburg, Virginia","Virginia, United States",Ghost Tours & Haunted Hotels,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Ghost Tours & Haunted Hotels :: The Two Little Boys of Williamsburg, Virginia

H i, I haven't been on in months because I was sooo scared of these 2 ghosts, so it took me awhile to get over it. I live in New York and I go to a traveling camp. We went to in the beginning of the summer to Williamsburg, Virginia, as some of you ghost hunters or experts know, that's where the ""Scariest Haunted House in America"" is. And yes, I stood outside in front of it. But even before my group went to the house, I spotted 2 little ghosts.

Our tour guide was really dramatic so it sounded even scarier when he told us this story. We were walking down this old street in this little town with all these old looking houses from the American Revolution (sorry to do this to the British but, go America!) Anyway, our tour guide stopped in the middle of this road. He goes ""Anybody hear anything?"" We all go ""No, why?"" He says ""Well a long time ago there was this father who had a little boy about 6 years of age and a slave also about the same age. The boy and the slave always had fun with each other. One day the father died from a horrible disease and was buried in a little graveyard. The boy died a year later from the same disease and was buried on top of the father. For some reason they buried the slave boy, when he died a year later, on the little boy. So now when you walk down this street you can probably see 2 little boys, one African American and one American, holding hands and skipping. They have red glowing eyes and are floating 2 inches above the ground!"" I was so freaked out. I hoped I wouldn't see them, I really prayed.

But when we came back from the house and had to walk down the street again, I saw two little boys about 10 feet away from our group, one black and one white, holding hands, red eyes, and floating 2 inches above the ground. I couldn't move, I couldn't speak, I couldn't even grab my cell phone and take a picture, I was so freaked out that when I closed my eyes and opened them, the boys were gone and my friend tapped me on the shoulder. I jumped.

That night I couldn't sleep. We saw all these freaky things. In another story I'll tell you about the Haunted House, but for now, I'm only telling you about the boys.

If you go to Williamsburg, Virginia and go to this ghost tour, you'll learn that those little boys in 2006 have been seen over 6,000 times, now in 2007, they have already been seen 7,000 times.

Uncle Rocky part 3,Canada,Family / Friends Visits,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Family / Friends Visits :: Uncle Rocky part 3

H i, I thought maybe I could add a little more to my experiences I've had with my brother-in-law who passed away about 6 years ago and hangs around, keeping us company. Maybe it seems I've got an awful lot to say about it but it's an ongoing thing so maybe I'll have stories to tell for years to come!

Ever since we moved into this house (Rocky never got to visit here, he was killed just before we moved in) little things have been happening. Some things are just general things, like the fact that since we've lived here we have found coins (some other items too, which I'll tell too) everywhere. Mostly pennies. At first I never thought a thing about it, maybe a bit annoyed at my husband because I was always picking them up everywhere. Finally I sort of clued in that it wasn't hubby's money, I was finding it everywhere! First it was a penny in a pocket or the washing machine, nothing odd about that. Soon it was like they were multiplying. We would keep a penny on the top of the bathroom door frame (it's the type of lock that you can only lock and unlock from inside, unless you use something slotted to turn the lock mechanism from the out-side of the door).

At first my boys were too small to reach the coins up top (my 'keys' so to speak), so I always had a coin there so I could open the door to give them a holler when they'd been in the shower for way too long or the ""Mom, I'm out of soap"" type of emergencies. Pretty soon there were two coins, then three and the next thing I knew there was a whole row of coins all the way across the top of the frame. That's when I really clued in. You can find pennies everywhere in my house, on the table, under the table, ditto counters, windowsills, in my flower pots, in shoes when you go to put them on. Weird places.

Along those lines, my youngest son has found 2 watches on the ground, I found a heavy Italian gold, 24 karat bracelet in a pocket of a jacket that I bought at a second hand store. I gave that to my husband and he loved it, then one day he just couldn't find it anywhere. We looked and looked and never did find it. My oldest son found a gorgeous 14 karat diamond and emerald ring as he was walking home from school. I have found many less valuable baubles around the house such as pretty marbles, little pieces of gold chain, once a little stone that looked like a kid's play jewelry diamond (I only have 2 boys) and other sorts of shiny odd little things. I realize that all of those 'finds' can be explained away but to me it just seems too coincidental.

We still find pennies and weird little baubles all over the place but no more valuable items. Maybe we just had a lucky streak but either Rocky's dropping us pennies or we have a breeding pair around here somewhere! I like to think the 'gifts' were from Rocky, he always was a generous guy.

Thanks for reading and letting me share with you. I'll tell some more of my 'Rocky' story another time!

Helen Cemetary,"Texas, United States",Misc,"I have way to many experiences! And one happened today. August 27,2007, after I got off the bus, I happened to look, and I saw the shadow man I've been seeing lately cross the dang corner of the house as if he was going to the backyard! Oh and I could see fine on the corner and gate, so once he turned he disappeared!

Here's another one, one day I decided to go ahead and talk to them and see where they were buried. Here is what I found out, by the way, I wrote it all down. Lela was born in 1456 and died in 1855. I think they messed it up by accident, but who knows? She's buried in Helen Cemetary which creeps me out! I read this book called, ""Here comes Helen"", it had a huge church that is now a house and a burned down place near it, then a gigantic cemetery! That's a real place and it's in Texas. That's where Lela is buried.

Then Aelx was born in 1855 and died in 1856. He lived in Dallas. I have a family that lived on this very lot that I am living on for a while! They had 3 babies but they died. I was just amazed at how much information I got just by asking about 3 questions.

I went into the bathroom and forgot to turn on the light, so I decided to look in the mirror for some reason and saw a black figure behind me, it freaked me out! Next it was in the night and everyone was gone, so suddenly I felt the urge to look down and pet a cat. I looked down and saw nothing nor felt anything, but finally I gave in! I could sense a cat's form and started petting it like how I would pet any other cat. Then it just walked away and the feeling left! I have 2 ghost cats here, one is black the other is white. There are twins who own these cats and they like to come over here to play with their cats since they leave them here. Now let me see, gotta go and eat dinner soon!

Spitting Demons?,"Ohio, United States",Demons / Possessions / Exorcisms,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Demons / Possessions / Exorcisms :: Spitting Demons?

I am 44 years old. When I was about 4 or 5 years old I had an experience that I have tried to make sense of ever since. I had just gone to bed on a summer's night. I know it was summer because it was still light outside, probably about 8:30 p.m.

I had not been in bed long and I looked up to the the window above and to the left of my bed. I saw two figures in dark hooded robes. I could not see faces... Just blackness. Then the figures (one or both - I'm not sure) spit on me. I felt totally paralyzed. I didn't know what else to do, but as crazy as this may sound, I tried to spit back at the figures. At that point they disappeared.

I told my parents about it, but they insisted it was a bad dream. So I tried to convince myself that it must have been a nightmare for most of my life.

However, about 27 years later my pastor and I were having lunch and somehow the topic turned to the ""world of darkness,"" for lack of a more handy term. So I told him about my experience, and he pointed out some things that lead me to believe this was more than a dream.

First, this would have occurred around 1967-1968. It wasn't like it is today with all of the fantastic scary movies. In fact, TV was rather wholesome. It was unlikely that I saw something on TV that foreshadowed this and came out in a dream.

Second, people commonly report seeing hooded demons. How would I have known that at that age?

Third, in reference to spitting, my pastor said this is a very specific demonic activity, however he didn't know the meaning of it.

If anyone knows what the spitting was all about, I would appreciate your feedback.

Evil Dream,"Maryland, United States",Misc,"W ell I'm not really sure how to explain all of this but here it goes... Lately I have been having horrible dreams probably for the past 3 months, but last night was the worst yet.

I went to bed around 11:45 pm or something... And I had a dream that I was walking down a stairway and on the banister was a statue of a little boy who looked pretty innocent. I turned back around and he was moving... He had a blurry face, black eyes, and when he opened his mouth he looked horrendous. I ran away from him... And suddenly I was out with friends at some random house. I kept seeing flashes of this evil boy between people or out of the corner of my eye. Well then the scene changes and I'm in a haunted house with my best friend and this boy is in the house. It just seemed so real (like all of the over things I dream). In my dream I woke up to tell my boyfriend who was sleeping next to me... And I saw this little boy in the room. I just was tugging at my boyfriend and screaming slightly.

Well I woke up for real at 1:40 and was FREAKED out. I had never been so scared in my life. I woke up my boyfriend and told him about the dream and he said I had woke up at 12:15 am and told him once already that night. But I only vaguely remember waking up but I know I saw that evil boy. Once he told me that I kept looking around the room as if the boy was present... Which started to scare my boyfriend.

What I want to know is if this has happened to anyone else. The house is sort of old. I wonder if I did wake up and see the boy and maybe he's a ghost... And my memory blocked that and made it seem like the dream. Or if I was unconscious still dreaming and carrying a conversation with my boyfriend at the same time. I'm very confused and scared about the whole experience.

Guardian Angel?,"Virginia, United States",Misc,"I have an incredible story that occurred very recently too - I would like to share it because I believe in guardian angels. I decided to go racing against my friend in his WRX late one night. He pulled up next to me and told me to follow him to a spot he thought was suitable for us. Now, me being the idiot that I was (at the time) and I just bought the car recently. Not to mention, just learned stick in a matter of days in the very car I bought, so that was stupid period.

We both went on a light with no cars around us and he got the lead. As I kicked into 5th gear and almost red-lined it before shifting into 6th, my car boosted up to 120 mph and I started making it past him by half a car length. However, I noticed that he down-shifted or slowed down and at that split second, I noticed there was a bend up ahead and I knew I was going too fast. I tried to hit the breaks so that it gave me enough time to down-shift but something told me not to. All of a sudden, my steering while started shaking violently. As I tried to gripe it, my car went spinning out of control.

At that point, I was thinking in my head... ""Sh*t, I'm going to die here... God, please help me..."" Then it seemed as if I had someone giving me instructions helping me out, because I turned the steering wheel to the right, which caused the car to shift the other direction thus avoiding hitting my friend altogether. Instead, I received impact to the curb, which caused my tire to go out and I could hear the wheel scraping the road.

As I came to a stop a good 100 feet or so down the road, I ended up on the other side of the road (oncoming traffic), but luckily nobody was coming my direction save my friend, who did a U-Turn and pulled up next to me. He was exclaiming to me that I almost ended up hitting him if I spun the other direction. He was saying that - that was a load of bull and that I must have a lot of luck because he exclaimed to me that in that situation, to turn out the way it did, that was close to impossible.

Thinking about it clearly now, I recall the bend and the curb. Had I turned the steering wheel to avoid the curb, I would've have spun the opposite direction and the front of my car would've smacked right into the front of my friend. Also, if I had down-shifted then at red-line, I would've most likely blown my engine and my car would've been in the worst case scenario. I didn't think about it at the time, because I didn't know anything about cars or red-lining for that matter (at the time) since this was the first time for me getting a fast car. (I found out about this later after the accident when a different friend told me about red-lining)

I thank God and my Guardian Angel that was there that fateful night to save me. I have had other instances where I was close to encountering death but I'll save that for another time. I am curious to see if anyone has had someone watch over them and guide them in a dangerous situation.

Dreams of Spirits,United Kingdom,Misc,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Misc :: Dreams of Spirits

I don't know whether this is spirits contacting me or what! But I have the weirdest dreams, I dream every night and always remember them in the morning. I have got book after book of dream meanings but never does it tell me what my dreams mean.

I always have dreams about being chased by spirits, or a spirit wanting to show themselves too me. Is this just my wild imagination or are they trying to contact me through my dreams? Sometimes I wake up with the feeling of being watched, the other week my window just smashed and blades of glass went into the garden below! The scary thing was 5 minutes earlier we were all standing out there?

I also believe I have met my guardian angel in my dreams, I don't remember the name but I know it is a young man of around 21 with dark hair and blue eyes. I love that I go into a different world when I'm asleep, and sometimes I prefer to be in that world, but sometimes I wish that I could just block them out and have a restful nights sleep in darkness!

I know this isn't a ghost story as such, but I was wondering whether maybe someone could help me or at least tell me what is going on?

Is there anyone else out there who goes through the same thing I do every night they close their eyes?

A  Ghost Boy in the Car,Philippines,Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: A  Ghost Boy in the Car

I t was 8:30 in the morning, we got all up to go grocery shopping and buy supplies for my cousin's birthday. When we were all ready to leave, I was the first to get in the car (2nd hand mitsubishi Pajero) since I don't put on make-up. I was silently enjoying the car music. I didn't notice my aunt going up to the back seat. She claimed she saw a spiky-haired boy beside me looking at the opposite side to where my aunt was. She thought the boy was my youngest cousin, I only notice her saying ""Miguel, where's your brother?"" I looked at her wondering why she's calling me Miguel (Name: Denice). When the actual Miguel came up to the back seat, my aunt was shocked she saw the real Miguel. Looking back to the back seat where I was, she also got shocked the boy was no longer there.

Even before this happened, there were numerous counts of farts but no one was farting at all. Even if the car was 2nd hand, it was still running at a fine condition. We got scared each time we left on a trip with that car. My father even saw the boy in the back seat through the rear mirror. We were all threatened by this spiky-haired boy. We went on this trip just to bless the car to be protected from evil spirits. It never happened again, we never saw the boy nor notice one of his farting.

Is It Trying to Tell Me Something?,Cyprus,Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: Is It Trying to Tell Me Something?

I moved into an old house about 5 months ago, it was pretty damaged and the walls needed to get painted and all, it seemed so abandoned but I always love a challenge so I decided to take it and see if I could turn it into what I had visualized - a beautiful home for me and my boyfriend.

The first few nights we could hear footsteps and doors being slammed from day one! Every night my boyfriend kept waking me up to ask me if I could hear someone in the house, I would remain silent and could hear movement, especially coming from the spare bedroom, with time we both got used to it and stopped talking about it...

One day, we decided to go out of town for the day, we packed, locked the doors and windows and left, when we returned after about 7-8 hours the front door was wide open! It hadn't been violated or anything and nothing was missing from the house, we found that extremely strange but soon we forgot about the incident.

One of the girls I work with was at my house during the same week that that happened and we were sitting outside in the garden when she freaked out and said she saw a white figure pass by real fast in front of her eyes and confessed it wasn't the 1st time she'd seen it there, I believed her and after a few days I saw it too, standing behind another friend of mine who is also a believer and whenever she's around spirits, her eyes get watery. It was about a head taller than me and my friend and transparent and whitish, we felt him in the room for a while then he left us alone.

My boyfriend doesn't really believe in ghosts but I do because I've seen and dealt with plenty in my life since I was a kid, he says he believes my stories but he doesn't like getting deep into them.

A couple of weeks ago, my boyfriend was asleep, me and my friend Marianne were sitting in the small living room talking when all of a sudden we heard a door slam, running shower for a few seconds and the smell of deodorant had covered the whole house! Marianne said, my boyfriend must have been taking a shower, so I got up to check, there was nobody in the bathroom, so I went to the bedroom and tuned on the light, my boyfriend was asleep, I woke him up and asked him if he'd taken a shower or sprayed deodorant he swore he didn't and turned the other side to continue with his sleep, I went back to my friend and told her, she said I should check again, so I did, came back to sit on the couch and started hearing the sound of deodorant being sprayed, a fffshhhhh sound over and over and over again, it had gone up to my throat! I got up again and this time went to the spare bedroom that we have, the light was on, it was really misty and the smell was even more intense in there! I freaked out which is very unusual for me and decided to get the paper and search for a new home, I figured the spirit didn't want me there... My friend left and I sat in bed circling ads, at some point I got up and went to the bathroom when I got back my pen was broken! Was he/she trying to tell me not to move out?

I still feel a presence there but I don't see it anymore... What does everyone think? Do I have an earthbound ghost in my house?

The Pig,"Texas, United States",Pets / Animals,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Pets / Animals :: The Pig

M y father told me this story a few years ago about when he was younger. They lived in Waco Tx at the time out in the country. He told me about this pet pig he had out in the farm that his parents had. I would say he was about 14 or 15 at this time. He would tell me that he would come home and feed the pig and ""hang out"" with him in the barn area all day. He would even lay his head on its belly and they would both fall asleep for a few hours. This was when the pig was big but not a full adult. I have seen how big pigs can get and that would be scary to lay so close let alone the stench and rough hair.

About 3 years later, my dad got home and couldn't find his ""pet"" anymore. He waited for his dad to get home to ask him where he was. His dad told him that he had to kill him to put some ""food"" on the table. My dad was mad and could not face the fact of it all.

For the next few days my dad told me he wouldn't eat or speak to his dad.

One afternoon when my dad was just about to enter the driveway he looked over to where the pig feeder was and saw his Pig! He was pretty excited about it but knew his dad killed it. As he walked up to it, the closer he got to it he realized strange things. The pig never looked up at him as it ate. It was eating like it hadn't eaten in years. When he got close enough he saw that the eyes were staring at him and they were dark red like blood shot. The hair looked like it was burnt. He stopped in shock thinking it was going to charge at him at any minute. He then looked at the rest of the body to see that its back hooves were that of a horse. He didn't know what to think but felt like his heart stopped. He turned away toward the house. He told me he felt like he was running but wasn't. He never told his dad anything because of how strict he was. He would have gotten in trouble telling his something like that.

A few months later on a night they were all supposed to go to church, my dad told his parents that he wanted to stay because he wasn't feeling good. My grandpa said it was fine as long as he kept the old shotgun near him. He said ok and they left. After watching Tv for a few hours my dad then laid back on the recliner with the gun beside him. He fell asleep.

He was awoken by a strange feeling. He told me that he felt really druggy like he was still asleep. (Kinda like when your so tired and you get up to do something then fall back asleep. then the next morning you thought you were dreaming that? Kind of like that feeling.) He then continued to tell me that when he woke up he listened for something. He didn't know what but he was keeping real still and probably not breathing. The Tv was already off and the fan was still going but gently. He then heard in the distance a pig. But he had no pig. He said his heart started beating real quick and out of control as if he was having a panic attack. Just a few seconds later he heard like a knocking noise in the coat closet next to the front door just about 10 feet from where he was. He was scared but manage to fall asleep with the tv on about an hour later. He remembered that he was having a bad dream. Like he couldn't breath. He struggled to breath but couldn't. He then opened his eyes.

He told me that there on his chest was a small human/creature thing looking at him right in the eyes. The face all mangled up with a look of confusion on it. My dad jumped up pushing the entity off like someone shrugging a spider or something off of them. He then reached for his gun while the creature ran away like a chimp would back towards the closet. My dad already had his gun to his shoulders aiming for a good shot but remembered that he was shaky. Right when the door closed he fired a shot hitting the wall and the closet door at the same time.

He said that the gun he had could have blown someone's head clean off from where he was standing. He left the house until his parent got there from church. He had a lot of explaining to do about what happened. That's all I know of the story.

But I do believe in what he told me because he wouldn't lie about something like that. Many of you pass my stories as lies but I can assure you that with everything that has happened with my family in the past generations and with me now, I can believe something like that. But I do understand your thoughts and opinions for we are free to make our own judgments. It's hard to believe something if it sounds strange. Thanks. SR

The Scariest Haunted House in America,"Virginia, United States",Ghost Tours & Haunted Hotels,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Ghost Tours & Haunted Hotels :: The Scariest Haunted House in America

L ike I said in my other story, The Two Little Boys Of Williamsburg, Virginia , I live in New York and go to a traveling camp. We went on a ghost tour in Williamsburg and went to the Scariest Haunted House in America. We just stood in front of it looking at it while our overly dramatic tour guide told us all these stories about the master bedroom on the second floor. About nine people died in that one bedroom, eleven people died in the whole house, and one person managed to get away before anything happened to her. Well one of the stories is very true because you can see it for yourself.

The first time someone died it that house was when there was a family of one mother and eight children. Four of the children died. One died in that master bedroom, the other three died in the backyard. The child that died in the bedroom was one of the oldest. About 14 years old. He loved that bedroom. One night he was falling asleep in there. He was awoken at around 3:30 am to the sound of his bed rattling. He looked over is bed and there, staring straight at him, an old women rubbing her hands together with a smirk on her face (kinda like one of those evil villains in old movies when they are about to do something evil). He kept on starring at her, and she was starring at him. The women goes after a while ""I'm going to kill you..."" The boy jumps out of his bed and runs to the mirror and checks if the women has a reflection. She doesn't. The women kills the boy, in the master bedroom.

Everyone in my group was so scared. I was shaking. I was so scared that I just kept on starring that the master bedroom window. Then our tour guide said something that was so weird (not scary, weird) that it got me wondering. He said ""Now, if you look at the window of the master bedroom, you can sort of see a dim light..."" I looked, I can see it, I thought, so there's a light, not so exciting. Then our tour guide says ""Now remember, this house is from the 1800s, there was no electricity in the house..."" I was like, oh my god! Where is that light coming from! ""Last year, a couple of ghost hunters on halloween, with a camera crew, came into this house, up the stairs, and into the master bedroom. The camera showed maybe 200 fireflies flying in a circle around the room, mostly around the mirror..."" I wasn't scared, everyone else was, I wasn't though because I was still wondering why. Well I know why they were in only the master bedroom and not the rest of the house and why they were mostly flying around the mirror, but I don't know why they were still glowing and still in there.

Under the Stairs in the Basement,"Massachusetts, United States",Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: Under the Stairs in the Basement

O ne time my grandmother was looking for an old trunk full of her high school yearbook and diplomas, so she went downstairs into the basement. Her house didn't have a light in the basement at the time so it was fairly dark when she reached the bottom of the stairs. I remember she told me that there was a small white glowing figure of a little girl only a couple of feet away from her, she thought it might have been a practical joke my cousin played on her. But when my grandmother reached out to touch it the little figure let out a muffled cry and vanished immediately.

Ever since then my grandmother has a light in here basement but there is a always a space under the stairs that does not get hit by the light and my grandmother swears she still sees that little girl watching her every move, but when she turns around to look the figure disappears. ""She was wearing a long dress that dragged on the floor and was holding a ragged looking doll in her left hand"" said my grandmother, ""She was also full of sadness... I could feel it"" My grandmother got very frightened about living in that house so she moved into a tiny two-story building.

She told me things in her building were going smoothly until she saw that little girl's reflection in her bathroom mirror. My grandmother screamed so loud that she almost lost her voice. The glowing figure let out the same muffled cry and disappeared one more, but my grandmother knows in her head that the little girl is still watching her from every dark corner in the building, and at night my grandmother thinks she hears that muffled cry when its really just the wind... Or is it?

Fingerprints on the Shower Mirror,"Wisconsin, United States",Poltergeists / Physical Manifestations,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Poltergeists / Physical Manifestations :: Fingerprints on the Shower Mirror

E ven though I grew up in an old house, I haven't had any ghostly experiences of my own until a few months ago. I have lived alone at my Madison apartment for almost a year, and this is where my first ghostly experience occurred.

One day in March, I was taking a shower before I had to go to one of my lab classes. While I was in the shower I heard a squeaking sound, like somebody wiping off the mirror. Since it was very early and I was half asleep, I thought nothing of it until I got out of the shower and noticed fingerprints on the mirror. It was just like somebody had just come in to wipe their fingers on the mirror. The bathroom door was shut tight the entire time, and I would have heard the bathroom door open if somebody happened to come in. Both of the doors to my apartment were locked and had the chains on. I have a cat, but cats don't have fingers, and they can't open doors.

I asked my neighbors if the guy I subleased the apartment had mentioned anything weird going on in the apartment, and they told me that he hadn't. They also assured me that he hadn't done anything evil in the apartment. When I got to school I told a couple of my classmates about it, and they didn't give me any answers either. I don't think they believed me.

My Midnight Companions,Canada,Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: My Midnight Companions

T his is the account of a series of happenings that occurred in a small basement apartment in Fredericton, New Brunswick; the various encounters with the paranormal are spread out over several years from 1998-2006. The home was quite old, having been built during the 30's with two confirmed deaths in the house. The house is built on land that originally was part of a large farm estate, the house of which is just up the street, perhaps a remnant of this period lies in the back yard as there is this small stone structure that's almost overgrown with weeds, I found it almost bye accident, though I haven't a clue what is is or what it was.

1)The man in my basement: The very first year I lived in this basement apartment we had to redo the carpets and the floors and such, I being a carpenter performed the work for my landlord and had him put it against my (far too high) rent. It was one of these such days that I received the scariest message in my life; I was all alone in the basement painting, when I felt the air grow cold, and I felt as if someone had entered the room, now I had neither seen nor heard anything and none was expected to come, but I had the unshakable feeling that I was just not alone. So I got up from my work and moved towards the entrance when I was stopped by an invisible force... And I heard this hoarse whisper in my ear... GET OUUUT. I know that sounds cheesy and fictional... But I swear it happened. I could feel the warmth of his breath on my ear, my shoulder felt like there was a hand almost touching it... But not quite... I ran out of the house to take a breather and when I went back in I was perfectly fine.

2) One night I lay sleeping in my bed in the bedroom and I awoke to seeing this Victorian looking woman folding clothes or something in the corner of the room. She turned... Looked at me... And her eyes were... Like red and glowing... But not quite because I could see through her, it's indescribable.

I have a few other tales but they'll have to wait as I have some laundry to do, in another room of this basement.

Strange Happenings in my New House,Australia,Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: Strange Happenings in my New House

I have moved into a house on 8 acres and is about 15 years old. Firstly I had my beautiful dog hit by a car out on the road, then a week later my love bird died without warning. I was very upset by these happenings but moved on. I was standing out near the garage watching my husband chop wood and I smelt perfume. I was not wearing any that day. The night before the eclipse, our bedroom door squeaked on and off for a few minutes. There were no windows or doors open for any breeze to come through. I shrugged it off until the next day, when I thought I'd have a little snooze on the couch.

I awoke to find that I could not move my body. It was not scary, so I closed my eyes and fell back to sleep for a few more minutes. That has never happened to me in my life. This took place where I have felt cold spots on and off since moving in 4 weeks ago. I told my husband all of these things, and he is not one to believe in spirits, but he did mention one time he was sitting on the toilet and the blind shot up by itself. It is on of those ones you have to pull down first for it to go up. I'm here by myself everyday, yet a bit uneasy. Is it that maybe the house is all new to us and we are just discovering those different sounds? I don't know. But I have lived in many houses where I think spirits are but have not made themselves known to me.

It seems here there a a few strange happenings. I am a very lucky person but lately my days have had a lot of hiccups since being here. I am not one to back down from a ghost or spirit, but I'm wondering if I should be more aware of a presence in my new home?

Soft Cry of a Chicken,"Alabama, United States",Pets / Animals,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Pets / Animals :: Soft Cry of a Chicken

I t was the dead of winter when me and my friends, Adam Harris, Josh Craig, Ryan Wells, and Cagle decided we would go up to the old Pig Silos located on the top of York Mountain. The Silos have been closed for well over fifty years, but that doesn't mean anything has stopped up there, as we all found out that night...

We parked the car a good ways away, and crept through the night towards the fence we were going to hop over. We climbed the fence and entered the building where they used to slaughter pigs. I don't know why, but the smell of rotted meat was noticeable. We got bored up there because nothing was going on, say for a single knock from inside a cupboard, which I'm saying was most likely a mouse or something.

We headed down to the old chicken houses. And we heard a door slam. We were a little scared, because we thought someone was there, then we saw the double doors, rusted completely hanging on the hinges, one of the doors swung open as we walked close. Suddenly from inside the chicken houses, we heard the soft cry of a chicken... We couldn't explain it, because there hadn't been any chickens in the building for over 50 years. And as we walked away, as if wanting us to leave, the big rusted door slammed shut as we left.

H-E-B Ghost,"Texas, United States",Apparitions / Voices / Touches,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Apparitions / Voices / Touches :: H-E-B Ghost

H ello everybody, it's been a while since I've been on this site, due to school and stuff, I haven't had the time for internet but I have a story to tell that happened recently over the past few weeks. I was with my mom in the car, we had just picked up a pizza from Little Ceaser's and were heading to H-E-B to buy my little brother a cake, since it was his birthday.

We got off to choose the cake and you know, we were just inspecting all the cakes they had on sale, seeing which one was the cheapest but most appetizing. We finally both came to the choice of the small, rectangular chocolate cake for 8 bucks, had it decorated and all the stuff, and got ready to leave. I, for one, really needed to go visit mother nature, so I decided to use a restroom in the store.

I went into the bathroom, which for some reason was completely deserted and as creepily dark as halloween night, but this was an emergency so I had to be brave. I switched on the lights, did my thing and went to the sink to wash my hands. I turned on the faucet, washed my hands and I'm a girl, so I had to take a checking at myself in the mirror (don't all you girls out there do too?) I looked into it for about a minute and then I could just make out the shape of a person's body just standing a couple of feet away from me. I was paralyzed, I didn't know what to do until the person in the mirror started descending towards me slowly, at that I screamed and ran out of there faster than you can say, ""scared to hell!"".

This was the first experience that I had that had to do with me actually seeing something out of the normal. What do ya'll think? Do you think that it's me, being too obsessed about these things and then my head creating weird shapes? Did I just imagine this, or is there really the genuine spirit of a deceased person in that restroom? Any suggestions...

Someone's Upset,Canada,Photographs / Videos / EVP,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Photographs / Videos / EVP :: Someone's Upset

U pdate on my house happenings : Over the past couple of weeks, we haven't really noticed much other than a couple of digital pictures we took one night at our house party - there's two pictures with clear orbs in them. Since then not much has happened until last night.

We had some sad news yesterday when my room mate got home from job hunting, she called me around 3pm to let me know there was cops and an ambulance surrounding our little culdesac. Our neighbor passed away, from what we know of it was natural causes. It was sad news, so we stayed in for the evening keeping the noise down to pay our respects to his family that were still at his house all night.

Just as her and I were heading to bed, the boys were sleeping already in the basement, it was around midnight - we were both laying in bed and I heard a bang. I text messaged her to ask if it was her and if she was alright. She had heard it to, and thought it was me opening my window. No, my window was closed. It was fairly windy outside so we put it down to that and tried to relax. I felt a breeze come through my bedroom and the temperature cooled down quite a bit, giving me goose bumps. I panicked. We got worked up - she and I came flying out of our rooms after hearing this banging numerous times, and then we flew back into my room and sat on the bed, all lights on breathing heavily trying to come up with some sort of explanation. ""Maybe it's the gate, maybe it's the fence, maybe it's one of the boys downstairs tossing and turning..."" I texted our room mate downstairs to see if he was awake, no reply. Then I heard him snoring. Banging again. We look up at my window, and it's slightly broken, and it was wobbling. We sighed and felt stupid. My room mate then decided that we should leave my motion sensor web cam on all night and see if it picks up anything, we put the sensitivity to extremely high, so even if the slightest movement occurred it would kick in and start recording. We calmed down and went to sleep, with all of the lights in the house on.

I finally awoke around 7:00 a.m. And puttered around getting ready for work. I looked at the video and checked it, it picked up nothing other than our room mate downstairs coming up to make himself a sandwich to take to work in the morning (in which he forgot all wrapped in tinfoil on the counter). I poured myself a glass of milk, checked the drawers (one drawer and one cupboard keeps getting left open, and sometimes opening randomly when we're not home - but we've been trying to stay calm about it, ignoring that it could be something paranormal and putting it down to just plain forgetfulness - even though this particular drawer usually is never opened for anything as there's just a bunch of crap mail in there). Anyhow, nothing was out of the ordinary at all in the house, and I left as my cab showed up and wandered to work. It's 9:53 AM now, my room mate woke up at 9:20 - she texted me this: ""Okay, the drawer, the cupboard, and the pantry door is wide open. And our light fixture on our kitchen light is sitting on the floor...""

No one was home during the time that I had left, and my room mate was sleeping. And she woke up to this. I've decided we're not going to attempt trying to catch it all on video again, as I don't think it was appreciated. I'm not sure. I don't know what to do.

Bed Bugs,"Arizona, United States",Misc,"W hen I was in 1st grade (1990/1991?) I remember this one night I had fallen asleep. I woke back up sometime late that night. I wasn't scared or anything. Then, I felt like something might have touched my arm or my side under the blanket. I think it didn't worry me because nothing was there. The room was somewhat lit because my bed was next to a decent sized window and even with blinds the street light shined through some.

So I get under the sheets to sleep. I'm almost asleep and then I open my eyes and see (what I'd describe as) large crickets crawling on me. It's almost like I could feel them crawling on me too, that was the scary part! By large, I mean roughly 6 inches in length per cricket/insect. All over me, even my face.

I ripped the sheet off and jumped out of bed. I threw some toys at the bed. I yelled for my mom. She came out very pissed because I woke her up. Either I had turned the lights on or she had. When those lights came on I EXPECTED to see something there. I was convinced something was crawling on me. But I went and looked myself and there was nothing there or under the bed.

I even remember to this day how vividly real I thought the bugs were. I'm pretty sure they were crickets or something resembling such an insect but much larger than they normally would be. This happened in Phoenix, AZ. We never had a bug infestation and I haven't had a phobia of insects, so I don't know what really happened.

With as many as there were and their size I really honestly thought I would see them when the light came on, even when my mom came in I thought I would be able to prove what I saw but alas, nothing was there.

River Trail in the Jedediah Smith Wilderness Area,"California, United States",Apparitions / Voices / Touches,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Apparitions / Voices / Touches :: River Trail in the Jedediah Smith Wilderness Area

T he Jedediah Smith wilderness area and bike trail cuts a transverse swath through one of America's major metropolitan areas, within it lies 32 miles of parkway, and is one of Sacramento California's most beautiful attractions. It is also one of the most haunted.

An ancient stave of trees can be not only a site for a lovely riparian picnic, but also a place to hide the darkest of human actions. Conceivably, for every murder in the world that receives full justice, fifteen murders go without justice. Why wouldn't a victim long for justice? As a teenager here, I always knew better than to explore there alone or in darkness. Just too many stories...

It wasn't until I was 25 that I walked there at night. And that was only on the levy that skirted the area, mere feet away from lighted apartments, and in the company of man who would and could protect me.

The specific spot is just a mile of so east of the Watt Avenue bridge on the Rosemont side of the city. My partner was an amazing person, a native American from the Umatilla tribe and part Norwegian. He could literally catch wild animals with his bare hands and was sensitive enough just to pick a spot and pick up native arrowheads in the sand. Just so you know I was in very good hands that night.

My feelings of protection lent me enough energy to admire the sever and wild beauty around me. The moon was close to full and shone lithe on the river, the animals that lived therein were as loud as a garage band on J street, and the trees and brambles hid everyone of them.

Up ahead of us Rob and I noticed a woman walking toward us on the levy. She was alone and seemed to walk confidently and unafraid. Rob and I moved over on the levy path to give her space to pass. The lights of the apartments and the moon reflected off the paleness of her clothes.

Our conversation died away as she came closer and just seemed to fade - leaving behind whiteness, then a pale vapor - then nothing at all. We were so frightened we immediately left the trail and cut back through the apartments to get home, hurrying to get the area out of sight and behind us! Please, don't go there at night, remember that was just on the outskirts of the wilderness, imagine what is in its HEART!

Violent Entity,"Virginia, United States",Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: Violent Entity

I was about 7 years old when it all started to happen. I was thirsty and decided to go downstairs to the kitchen to get me something to drink. When I reached the tops of the stairs a hand shot out of the darkness and grabbed my throat and tightened around it. I stood there fearing that if I made a sound it would tighten its grip and choke me. After what seemed like ages the hand let go and disappeared. I ran downstairs to my parents bedroom, which happened to be the basement, and told them what happened. They told me to go back to bed.

So as I headed up the stairs I was punched in the back and fell down the stairs. I slept in the living room that night. The next five weeks I slept there and heard tapping on the inside of the windows and footsteps from the kitchen and lower bathrooms. The entity would show itself to me during this time. No one believed me except for my brother Will who saw the ghost just like I did. It never touched him but it scared him every night. He and I would wake up in the mornings with bruises all over our bodies.

Finally our parents had enough of our whining and we moved out of the house three months later and have never been bothered by the entity since then.

Ghost Soldier Comforting Me,Philippines,Psychic / Medium,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Psychic / Medium :: Ghost Soldier Comforting Me

I t happened in my traumatic childhood. I've only got shocked and remembered it when I saw someone on the ground with his face covered with blood after a traffic accident.

I was about 6 years old when this ghost visited me. I really wasn't aware of the fact that he was a ghost soldier smiling at me. I felt normal even though his face was covered in blood. I got the trauma from my father, constantly punishing me each time I made a mistake, hitting me with this roughly skinned leather belt. I often sought refuge just outside of the house at night... sitting there minding my own business when there was a man standing at the right in the range of my view. I just saw him, then he walked up to me with a comforting smile like he had this sympathetic intention from what I was going through with my father.

He would gently blow a cool breeze to comfort me after a beating from father. Even if I was still a child, I saw through him his past. He lived a poor and hard life but withstanding it with a smile and a strong but not blind optimism. He encouraged me just by that... He would sometimes sit beside me and look up at the stars, showing how beautiful all natural things were. It continued until I was 11, in the verge of much expanded understanding of life from that friendly ghost.

I thought to myself, maybe he left because now I understand everything... The suffering that I needed to go through, the burden I need to carry for a much lighter life.

ANY COMMENT APPRECIATED... Thank you for letting me convey this... The ghost's acts are now lifted from vain.

Dreams of Spirits 2,United Kingdom,Misc,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Misc :: Dreams of Spirits 2

I woke up late for work this morning so I had forgotten I had a dream, but it came back to me, I had another dream last night! So I thought I would write and tell you about it! My dreams jump a bit so I hope you can keep up with me.

First off I was in a seaside town somewhere, like Brighton or Southend, and I was visiting my sister who was working in some sort of deli, I spoke to her for a while and it started to rain so I decided to make my way home. I was living in a small block of flats and when I walked in through the communal doors, I felt something watching me, I went to go in the lift but couldn't get in and started to walk up the stairs, and I kept seeing this dark shadow appear then disappear, hiding round corners and in between stair ways.

Then suddenly I was in a small wooden house, and it wasn't in this country! I was with my sister and I was determined to make this house my home, but this shadow would not leave me alone, it kept pushing me and moving things! I remember I wanted to leave but it wouldn't let me!

This shadow is of a man, I know that much! And even though I may be in different places and different dreams, it's always the same ""thing"" that follows me!

I'm getting pretty freaked out! I don't really feel anything when I'm awake! Sometimes I will see small things from the corner of my eye but not sure whether it just me seeing things!

Something Calling my Name,Suriname,Apparitions / Voices / Touches,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Apparitions / Voices / Touches :: Something Calling my Name

T his happened to me a few years ago. Not really ghostly, but it scared me nonetheless. I was living with my partner in a new neighborhood. There weren't many people living in my street and there were no street lights yet.

My partner never took the keys to the house with him when he went to work. He always called for me when he came home. He worked nights, so he would wake me up between 12:00 and 1:00 am. Our bedroom was in the front, so from the bedroom window you could look right in the street.

One night, it was weekend, I had trouble falling asleep. I took a book and started reading. After half an hour or so I heard my partners voice, clear as day, calling my name behind the window adjacent to my bed. I did not react at once, because my partner had a noisy car (which I did not hear) and the porch made a rusty sound when you open it (which I also did not hear). But still I clearly heard his voice. I remained silent for I thought that if it was him he would call again. But he did not.

After another half an hour, or maybe longer, I suddenly heard the familiar noisy car coming up the drive way, the rusty porch being opened and my partner walking up to the bedroom window to call for me.

We related this to his mother and she said that something probably imitated him, since this is a 'ritual' he performs daily around the 'unholy hours'. Well, he broke that ritual at once, because ever since that incident he took his keys with him.

Violent Little Boy,"Washington, United States",Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: Violent Little Boy

I 'm 12 now, so I can remember this pretty clearly, when I was 2, I remember I was at my grandma's old house and I was in the room where all the toys were. I saw the door open and then close a little boy was standing right in front of me, he looked about 10, he had blue shorts on a green shirt and a baseball cap. He said his name was Billy, then he asked me if I wanted to play with a certain toy, I picked up a different toy and said I liked the one I had better. He got back up, took the toy out of my hand and hurled it across the room. I started to cry, I remember he put his hand over my mouth and told me to hush or he would smack me. I struggled to get up and get myself to the door. I yelled out ""I'm telling my dad!"" When he grabbed my arm, slapped me in the face and then scratched me. Then I saw an older man dressed in all black shake his head as if he was telling the boy to stop. The man lifted me and set me down and they both disappeared. And then that's when everyone walked in, my grandma was freaking and saying I had a slap mark and scratches! I never really had anything else happen there I never saw the boy again, but the man I saw a lot, he was nice, he talked to me sometimes though.

Grandma's Birthday,"South Dakota, United States",Family / Friends Visits,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Family / Friends Visits :: Grandma's Birthday

L et me start by saying me and my bestest life long friend are closer then sisters and we go to all of each others family events because that's just how close we are, her family is like my family my family is like her family and a couple of years ago, my grandma passed away due to cancer and every year on her birthday, we bring flowers to her grave.

Last year it was very last minute (sorry grandma), it was about 11:30-midnight by the time I remembered that we forgot to bring flowers out to the cemetery and I stood up and said we have to bring flowers to grandma's grave. Thank god walmart is open 24-7 and they don't ever close the gates to the cemetery she's buried in, because it's in the middle of nowhere, pretty much. We went and bought flowers and headed out there, back then I had this big old 91 buick lesabre it was just a big ol' boat of a car it was a total piece of crap and I mean that, those of you who know what they look like know that's a pretty solid car, heavy doors, etc.

Right when we got to the gate of the cemetery, my friend started flipping out, screaming about a lady in a black robe with a pale face and dark sunken in eyes standing by the gate. I looked back and didn't see anything, so I thought she might have just seen like the shadow of the car or something. We pulled up to my grandma's headstone (it's on the very end closest to the driveway) and my friend was like begging me just to bring the flowers out the next day, when it was light out, and I'm like, ""well were already here and my car is a gas guzzler"", I said ""whatever you saw is gone now and I don't think it wants to hurt us, so I'll be quick about it"" (normally the cemetery has a very friendly vibe but not that night, that night I had a very uneasy feeling), I asked if she wanted to come and put the flowers on grandma's grave with me and she said, ""just tell grandma happy birthday from me"", that's how I knew she was scared. Normally she would have came with me no matter what since this was like her grandma too.

So I finally got out of the car, flowers in hand, I left my car door open because I was a little freaked myself, I walked to my grandma's grave set down the flowers and said ""happy birthday grandma from the both of us"". Just as I stood and turned around, out of the corner of my eye I saw my car door slam shut, hard! My friend started screaming. No the car was not tilted, it was not on a hill and no, there was no wind that night, it was a perfect windless summer night.

I was in total shock that big ol Heavy car door couldn't have shut by itself, no way, it took a very hard shove to shut it so there's no way it could have just slammed shut like that! I froze, not knowing what to do, I couldn't move! Finally I got the courage to make a mad dash for the car, I grabbed the door handle which was freezing, which didn't make since because it was 80 degrees that night, I flung the car door open jumped in the car and threw it into drive (it was very cold in the car and my A/C didn't work). My poor friend was pale as a ghost herself and she just kept screaming ""go go go"" she says she was just sitting there watching me and the door just slammed shut and the steering wheel shook a little so she started screaming, just as we were pulling out of the cemetery we saw a very dark shadow by the end gate so we hauled a-- out of there and went straight home!

When we got home we told my mom what had happened and she said well maybe it was grandma's way of telling you to get home! (because I didn't have a driver's license at the time... naughty me)

Evil Granny,"North Carolina, United States",Family / Friends Visits,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Family / Friends Visits :: Evil Granny

O ne night, I was at my grandma's house with my mom. My mom was in bed and me and my brother were staying up late. It was like 3:30 am, when me and my brother were getting tired. So I decided to get a glass of warm milk to help me sleep while Courtney, my brother, went to his room.

When I was done. I went to the hallway to make my way to my room, when all of a sudden I saw a woman standing in the hallway. She looked like she was in her 30's or 40's, but the thing that freaked me out was the fact that I could see right through her. I wanted to move but I couldn't, I wanted to scream, but I couldn't. I just stood their frozen.

Just when I thought things couldn't get any freakier. I saw a smile slowly form on her face. Then she started walking towards me, walking became jogging then she was running with a devilish grin on her face. I just watched in horror. Then she ran faster and faster until she started screaming ""Run child run"". After that she started laughing like a devil or something. So I took her advice and I turned the other way and ran like hell. While I was running I was screaming my lungs out. I guess my mom heard me screaming, because I ran into her in the hall, scared as hell. I was just trembling in her arms the whole night with the sound of her laugh in my head.

That night my mom was crying because I was trembling so much. Finally she asked me what was wrong with me. So I told her everything, and the more I told, the more worried she got. Once I was done, she told me about her mom, and that was who I saw in the hallway.

From that day forward I would just tremble with the sight of that house.

Steve,"California, United States",Haunted Places,"I t was around 1:00 am and I had this strange feeling, so I turned over in my bed and opened my eyes. There was this white figure, five feet away, it became clearer by the second and soon I was able to make out eyes, nose, friendly smile, and most of the figure. It smiled at me and left.

I told my friends about it and they said they thought it was a ghost. I named him Steve. I still see or hear him around today but nothing like the first encounter. I was staying in a hotel in Savannah, Georgia and I was standing in the parlor eating chocolate kisses and I was about to go downstairs to the room and I saw a shadow on the wall that didn't move with mine. I knew I was alone so I assumed it was Steve. I started walking down the stairs and I hear creaks that the stairs had never made before and booming sounds followed me. They sounded like feet. I think that Steve was traveling with me that trip.

Later I heard that all sorts of weird things were happening around there. Mysterious mist in the graveyards, voices with no one speaking and (my favorite) a little girl giggling and pulling on your skirt when your alone. The town was said to be haunted and I knew that about a month before I came to town, they dug skeletons out of the walls of the room I was staying in.

I love that place and the Hotel was called the Foley House Inn.

Summer House in Madrid,Spain,Misc,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Misc :: Summer House in Madrid

A fter reading here for a bit I felt like sharing something quick just to know your opinion. I am 19 and used to live in my mom's house in Madrid (Spain), now I live in England, but still come to this house during summer... mainly because most my friends live in this area. It is not really an old house, it was built around 1940's during the end of the Spanish civil war, it's an 7 floor flat building, and I live in the 6th floor (in america I suppose you would say I live in the 7th but that's not really important). Let's say that a few things have happened...

I remember when I was about 10 or 11, one morning I woke up, probably around 3 am and remember not being able to move but feeling getting repeatedly slapped on my cheeks. It never happened again but I clearly remember my cheeks being bright red in the morning when I went to the toilet.

Other things that have happened is... well let's say that when I am not out, which is very rarely during the summer that I'm here, I spend time until very late on the internet and don't go to sleep until about 6 or 7 am. Every night at exactly 3 am I hear as if it was raining but when I go out to the terrace, there is no rain what so ever, it's always from 3AM to 4AM, every day with no exceptions.

Thirdly I also notice sounds of banging and scraping on the roof every night, when in fact, what is over me is the roof (the top floor is half the size of the other apartments and my room is to the side that is roof) and I can assure you that it could be the wind... But every single day?

That's really the end of what there is to say about this house. But I would like to mention that in the house I live in England (in Eastbourne, South East) is a typical Victorian building with 3 floors plus a basement and an attic. I know two people of my family have died there, and heard some stories which I find irrelevant and don't believe. In any case, what I will say is that my room is always freezing compared to the rest of the house (probably because it's the only one without double-glazing). But I can assure you that some places give me the chills and at night time I have to sleep with the TV on in order to go to sleep. There is also a few things that I haven't been told simply because they preferred not to about my room, probably joking but you never know it simply makes me scared... The funny thing is that I have never experienced anything happening there, except for scraping on the walls at night, but I assume that to be the wind anyway.

So in conclusion, what do you think? am I simply over-wound up about stuff that is nothing weird, or is there any paranormal logic to this?

Big White Light,Australia,Orbs / Lights / Mists,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Orbs / Lights / Mists :: Big White Light

I have another story which happened in 2000. My partner and I were in the kitchen doing the nightly dishes after putting the kids to bed. I was standing at the sink looking out of window where you can see other people's roof tops. About three or four houses down there was a white round fuzzy light (orb?), it was circling their roof top over and over again. Sometimes it hovered a bit, but would then start circling again. I called my partner over, and we stood and watched this light in amazement. I know your thinking it was a light from another source like a spot light or something, but we went outside and checked it out, and nothing could be seen to make this light happen.

The light just kept going in its weird way. We went back inside and watched out of the window for what seems like forever, and it didn't stop, change positions or falter in any way. It was still erratic in its movements. We did live three doors down from a cemetery, but I don't really know if that had anything to do with it. My partner and I think someone might have died there that night? I don't know, but we sure did not imagine this light. It was far too real, with no explanations. The more we stood and watched, the more I believed what I was seeing.

The Haunted Hallway,"California, United States",Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: The Haunted Hallway

T his story takes place in victorville, Ca, at a house in The beautiful Spring Valley Lake (on cresta blance court). I had moved to Victorville in late October 2005, and I knew NO ONE. The first day I had started school a girl named Michelle approached me and ever since we've been best friends, also the first day of school, I saw this guy and fell in love automatically.

It was several weeks before he even said a word to me thanks to a friend of his who I shared a class with, he over heard me talking about him and told him and so the guy (Jordan) approached me. We ended up going out several times but it wasn't until New Years that I went to his house for the first time. The house had the darkest and most depressing living room I've ever been in, it could be the brightest day on earth and that living room remained dark so everyone usually sat in the bright and happy dining/kitchen area. The house was set up as such (entire the front door to your right are french doors leading into a study which was turned into a bedroom, to your left was the dining area from the dining area, you could enter the kitchen but also if you kept straight from the front door you could enter the kitchen to your left, and to your right the hallway continued but if you kept straight a few steps you would be in the living room).

If you walked through the living room and go through the doors you would enter the (boom boom room) which was like a den but people slept in there... If you went right down the hallway from where it turns into the kitchen or living room you would continue down the hallway until you hit the linen closet where you would have to go left to the master bedroom and one of the bathrooms or right to another bedroom and the laundry room.

The first time I spent the night jordan and I slept in his room. I fell asleep before he did and woke up in the middle of the night. I saw someone sitting up in the corner, the room was dark but I could tell that they were looking at me. I thought it was one of his brothers who had stayed in the room with us or maybe jordan had fallen asleep in the corner. I looked beside me in the bed and jordan wasn't there so I looked down on the floor beside the bed and there was jordan sleeping. I looked up to the corner again and whoever it was had gone. The bedroom door was locked. I didn't want to seem crazy so I didn't mention this because although I knew they said the house was haunted, they always said it was the hallway.

Later when I would visit, whenever the door was locked, it would start to rattle real hard like someone was trying to break in. Jordan told me that it was probably the wind. I wanted to believe him but none of the windows in the bedroom were open and I don't think any wind would shake the door that hard. I got used to the door rattling and the chills while walking through the hallways and doors slamming shut. I just accepted that the house was haunted. Thankfully I didn't have to live there!

One day jordan had told me he experienced something really scary. He said he woke up one night to go get some water out of the kitchen, he said when he opened up the door in the middle of the hallway he saw his 18 month or so old niece standing there. It was really late in the night and he thought maybe she woke up to go to his mom's room or something but he wasn't going to just walk past her, so he said he went to pick her up and she disappeared leaving him in the hallway alone. He got scared and didn't even bother to get the water. I was there that night so when he came back in the room, he woke me up and together we walked to jeremy and taya's room (his nieces parents), it was the first room when you entered the house, we tried to push them open but the door were locked. This meaning jamya could not have been in the hallway. WE RAN BACK INTO THE ROOM, locked the door and told his mom everything when morning came.

She told us that several days beforehand she had experienced the same thing except that she always wakes up at the same time in the middle of the night and walks around the house checking on things. She said that when she started down the hallway to the kitchen she heard a baby crying and then she saw jamya standing there, as she got closer and was talking to her trying to comfort her, she smiled and disappeared. Tammy doesn't really get scared of this things so was just surprised, she too checked jeremy and taya's room and once again it was locked.

Every one in the house sort creeped out by this but what really did it was when tammy was cooking, one night, and if you were at the stove, if you looked to your right, you were looking straight down the hallway, which was also dark unless you had it light. Well jamya liked to play in the hallway so she was there and everyone else was scattered around the house when tammy said ""DINNERS READY"" jordan me and a few other people came from the boom boom room and some more people from the back of the house, we all seemed to get to the hallways right in time to see jamya slammed against the wall by something. We all stopped and stared. She stared in front of her and then her eyes followed something heading towards the kitchen. After that she wouldn't play in the hallway. We didn't talk about that ever again after that.

One day everyone was in the boom boom room. At this point I was living there too because my dad was arrested and he had been evicted from the apartment we were living in and I had no way home (I had moved there from out of state). I had just came from the bathroom and started down the hallway. At the end of the hallway was a mirror and I was looking at myself through it the whole time thinking about how terrible I looked at the point in time. Well as I was walking down the hallway, almost toward the middle I saw a dark tall figure of a man walking behind me, but not following me, he had walked from the area of tammy's room towards jordan's room. This scared the shiat out of me. I knew NO ONE ELSE was in that area of the house besides me and on top of that, no one else in the house was a tall shadowy figure. I ran into the boom boom room and told jordan everyone went back there and there was NO ONE.

Then on one more occasion Taya and I were the only ones in the house besides jamya. We sat there in the kitchen eating dinner at the point jamya was older barely two years old, but she could talk so well. She said to us ""That's girls here"" and pointed to the hallway. Taya and I looked and saw nothing but then several moments later we both got chills and that's when jamya said ""and that man's here too. He kill her he kill the girl"" and started smirking and giggling. She then took her fork and started stabbing at herself, not had just gently, and started talking saying things like ""he bad he a bad man he kill her mama he kill that girl"" and would point to the hallway. We moved jamya's chair so she couldn't see into the hallway anymore but the it started again she started saying ""she's scared because that man's going to get her and he in the hallway too..."" We had no choice but to believe jamya was seeing things in the hallway and that possibly was being possessed into telling us what she saw, because how could she know what words to use to tell us or even show us with her fork? She was only two... Taya and I were SOOO SCARED!

From that point on jamya continued to talk about that little girl and the man and tammy, jordan, jamya and myself would start to see him more and more. I started feeling at times evil jordan and I would start to argue more as would tammy and her boyfriend and then one day (at this point I was pregnant), I just flipped, jordan's brother justin had came into the dining room and started talking about how I was making a mess with the papers and as he went to pick them up' he knocked over my water. I just flipped out, I took the scissors which we VERY VERY VERY SHARP and throw them at him with all my force and thankfully he dodged and they missed him at less than and inch and hit the wall. Then I stormed out of the dining room and hit the hallway, I felt like someone had pushed me back and I fell backwards and before hitting the ground, deshay (their mom's boyfriend) caught me.

After that I left the house to stay with my grandma who had moved to california but a couple of hours away and I never went back... Although jordan would still call me and tell me stories, until they decided after too much happenings to just move. Jamya was being pushed around and assaulted more, the ghost was starting to appear to more of them and the front door would just open and close.

But I guess what really did it was when tammy was entertaining one day and after everyone had left (besides the people who lived there), she was cleaning up in the living room when jamya came into the living room wanting to be picked up, so tammy picked her up and started to head back towards the kitchen, when she said she felt like something had pushed the side of her and was falling in like slow motion. When she realized that she was falling into the glass coffee table, she said she knew that there was no nothing she could do, they were going to fall into the table, when they hit the ground, in a split second, the table moved, but not just a little bit, it zoomed right into the wall! And shattered...

That was it, they started packing that night and were gone. I know it doesn't seem like a lot of this stuff is possible but I experienced it and so did nine other people and we honestly believe the house is haunted. We never did any research on the house but I do think it would be a good idea to. I don't know what is is but it seems like every house they move into is haunted from the stories tammy would tell me, to the experiences at both the houses I would be in...

I'm going to post more stories on here though about more experiences... I think that perhaps I have the ability to see ghosts, however ONLY through reflections... Do anyone else think this same thing?

My Office Building,"Louisiana, United States",Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: My Office Building

I work for attorneys handling real estate. The company is made up of two separate buildings and houses all of 150 employees. The buildings that we are in are rumored to be an old hospital of some sort. The main office is said to be the actual hospital, and our smaller building off to the left was said to be the women's labor quarters. Now wether they were really split... I don't know.

I am in a room the size of a college classroom, not too big, but big enough for 9 cubicles (8x8). Only 7 of these cubicles are occupied. At times you can hear loud noises such as banging or hitting on the walls and often can hear babies cry. (we are not allowed to bring our children to work because of insurance purposes.) Many times I have heard what I thought was a coworker of mine talking on her phone and I look over or behind me and no one in our room is on the phone! My mouse will randomly move around my screen, and the funny thing is, I am not afraid.

Tuesday morning we came in at the usual time of 7:30am and the door to our room was locked. No one on this entire office had a key, we had no reason for one, our room was never locked and never had been. We had to call a locksmith to come and unlock the door. He arrived about an hour later and tried many tools to open the door and really had a rough time. He said it was very unusual that the door was so hard to open.

Finally he got it open and we all went in and sat at our desks and it was cold... Very cold... I could see my breath cold. It was never that cold in our room. As a matter of fact I have two fans at my desk because it does stay so hot. I don't know if this is in fact paranormal activity or if I am just crazy.

I have recently had a baby. I have been back to work for almost 2 months now and I don't know if I am having horrible separation anxiety and miss my baby so much I make myself believe I can hear her cry or if something has happened here and whatever or whoever it is is trying to get me to help them because I am the most recent ""new mother"" in our office. It is weird but amazing at the same time. I was never a believer and still not sure if I am, but whatever it is, wants something from me. I know it's not harmful, it's too pleasing to be. The voices of others talking on the phone and the feeling of being in here is too ""happy"" I could say. It's like comfort and heartache all at the same time. Like whatever happened here was not done out of anger or malice, but by accident.

Can someone please help me to figure out what is going on... Do I need a medium for the spirits or medication for me?

Seeing Ghost Only Through Reflections,"California, United States",Apparitions / Voices / Touches,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Apparitions / Voices / Touches :: Seeing Ghost Only Through Reflections

A s a child I had experienced many deaths of people in my family or just people who were close to me. Before they died I always would get a feeling or dreams and images and from that I was always scared of supernatural things or ghosts and spirits and wanted to be ignorant towards it. My mother had died so I lived with my grandma and our rooms were next to each other. I have always been afraid to sleep by myself so I used to ask my grandmother to keep her bedroom door open and I would keep my bedroom door open too so that I could feel close.

I was however still afraid because with my bedroom door open, something could easily get in but with it closed something could already be in there and I couldn't get out. Either way, I was terrified and always slept with this one specific teddy bear I called Mr.Fuzz. It was the last gift I ever got from my mother and I kept that teddy bear for many years. I don't remember what exactly happened to it and do somewhat miss it but in its later years, it started to look different, somewhat demonic, so I don't mind it being gone, he'd been replaced by my boyfriend of the last three years before I lost him.

One night and of all nights it was Halloween, my grandma had a guest over and she had shut her door for the night. I had to have been ten or eleven at this time and I had left my teddy bear at my aunt's house by mistake so the fact that her door was closed and that I did not have mr. fuzz kept me from falling asleep easily and staying asleep.

Well eventually in the middle of my tossing and turning I had woke up because I heard talking. I originally thought that the voices were coming from outside my window and assumed that maybe there were still halloweeners outside. I was afraid to look out my window and see there were still halloweeners there, I didn't want to see anyone dressed up scary because I was already scared without that to put on top of it.

The voices stopped for awhile and then started again. I reluctantly decided to look out my window I thought maybe I would ask these people to leave me alone. I peeked out of it and saw no one yet the voices continued, I then thought perhaps it was my grandma and her guest talking, until I laid back down in my bed. Now my bed was directly across from my closet which doors were mad of mirrors. As I lay back down in my bed I saw the reflection of three people standing there... Looking at me looking at me. Needless to say it scared the shiat out of me, I got scared and ran to my grandma's room, she didn't hear my come in and so I laid on the floor.

I couldn't sleep... And I wouldn't sleep in my room for days until I got my teddy bear back. To this day I'm not sure if the figures were actually in the mirror looking at me or actually next to me in my room and I was seeing them through the mirror because from later experiences, I've learned that the only time I see ghosts is through a reflection of something, even though I do feel strong presences at times. Well needless to say, I moved my bed in a direction different from the mirrors and I never saw these three ghosts again.

Ghost Soldier,"New York, United States",Psychic / Medium,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Psychic / Medium :: Ghost Soldier

E very since I was a little kid in california, I've always seen, heard, or felt weird things. When I got older I looked back into my past as a child and decided that everything I had seen, was just my overactive imagination. But I was wrong, I started to discover a whole other realm to all these happenings. Just like a lot of people I know, I constantly see things out of the corner of my eye. I thought that was normal but whenever I passed by a cemetery or some building or certain area, I always got these feelings that weren't of my own.

I would feel angry, then sad, and then depressed or confused. Lots of different emotions poured into me when I'm around a lot of, well I guess you could say spirits or ghosts. I have many ghost stories but my most recent one is where I currently reside. I live on post in Fort Drum, New York. I've been seeing weird things in my room that were extremely strange to me, such as little balls that float along the wall. These balls come in different colors to, I've seen them like this fiery color or like the static from a t.v.

Also, every now and then I'll see something black crawl up my leg, or run across the ground and there about the size of a small cat. The balls I see are a little bigger than a golf ball. I've also seen a shadow pacing across the top of my lights in my room. But one day I was sitting at my computer and I felt someone standing behind me and I looked and there was a soldier in uniform standing behind me looking at me and seemed faint. I could see through him, he wasn't solid looking like the others.

The funny thing was I found out, a couple days after I saw him, that he was a soldier that used to live in my room, but he committed suicide out in his car. I had this guy's old room. Now I see things everyday in this room. I'm used to seeing things because you can see so much of something strange and then just get used to the fact that you can see things.

So I've been living my whole life with the unexplainable and I'm here, now, to ask why?, how? and is it normal to see things?

My Granny,"West Virginia, United States",Family / Friends Visits,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Family / Friends Visits :: My Granny

W hen I was 15yrs old my granny passed away at my uncle's house. About two weeks before she passed away, I was getting ready for school in my bedroom, looking in the mirror. Over my shoulder I saw my grandfather who had passed away eight months before. I never thought anything of it because I have seen many figures before this time that stay with me at all times, until I was told that on the day that my granny died, she told my aunt that he was waiting for her.

She said that she felt his presence frequently and would talk to him at hours at a time, bickering like they have done for years. On the day of her funeral, my youngest aunt was sitting in a recliner at my uncle's house, crying. I knelt down beside her and the area around her was ice cold. I instantly knew it was my granny for some reason. I felt that she wanted my aunt to know that she was there for her and to give her comfort. When my aunt was told of this, it helped reassure her during her grieving.

Then after I had my daughter, I was living at my uncle's house and every night you could hear my granny singing my daughter to sleep. My daughter would also look into spaces at times and gurgle like babies do when they are being played with (anyone who is around babies will understand).

One day my husband and I were sitting on our bed discussing something and on his thigh you could make out the imprint of a hand. I felt for some reason after I calmed down that she was showing me that she approved of my husband. At certain times you can hear different things in my uncle's house that let you know that she is still around. Usually it is when someone needs reassurance of some kind.

Children who Play with Ghosts,"California, United States",Children Who See Spirits,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Children Who See Spirits :: Children who Play with Ghosts

W hile living with the father of my child I've experiences several haunting occasions. The first and scariest happened at the first house we lived in, eventually we all got enough and moved into the second house. I didn't not live there in the beginning but before they moved again I had for several months. At this point our daughter, who was born early, was a year old. She was just learning to walk and the house was pretty big and she loved the space to practice. They had been living in the house for an entire year and have not experienced anything. I would come to visit and unlike the other house, I didn't mind being left home alone until after they had officially lived there for a year and also after grandma died and julian (my boyfriend's youngest brother, 17) had been shot in the head twice and almost died. I began to feel presences and experience cold spots in the house (I'll post more stories about some of the things that have gone on later.)

My daughter was just learning to walk and she would walk back and fourth from the hallway to the back rooms and so on. I had been sitting in the living room one day and she got to practicing, it was a couple of minutes before I realized that she was gone and I went to look for her. I found her standing in the doorway to Tammy (my boyfriend's moms) room. She was looking up at something smiling and laughing, I of course looked around and saw nothing, tammy was asleep in her bed and no one else was home. I brought my daughter back into the living room. On several occasions, I would find her ""playing"" in the doorway to tammy's room and and finally accepted that she had acquired a ghost playmate, but seeing as how she couldn't talk, I will never know. I didn't think that this ghost was harmful but it still scared me and I never wanted to be home alone.

After a while my daughter was able to walk and run and one day her cousin Jamya was there and they were playing. They ran from the front living room to the hallway, chasing each other, laughing, just having fun. I was cooking and watching them from the kitchen. I noticed that they had BOTH stopped playing and where standing in the living room, staring at something, I looked and watched them both turn their heads, look past me and into the hall, they started to laugh again and followed after it. I called for jamya to come to me and asked her why they had stopped playing and what were they looking at? She simply responded ""that boy, he so crazy"" and laughed and ran off.

Eventually andrea would not play in Tammy's doorway anymore but instead had a fascination with the living room. We had two living rooms in the house, the front living room where the experience with jamya and andrea occurred was nicely decorated with photos, white couches, a bar, a chinese table, statues and such. No one was ever in there. The second was more comfortable and everyone gathered there. Andrea would just get up and walk into the front living room and always she would head towards the bar and open it (how she knew how to do this I do not know) but she would open it, and three times, would grab the wine glasses and break them. We eventually found a way to keep her out of it but she would still try.

Then one day while I was in the kitchen I looked out the window in the front room and saw someone in the kitchen behind me, it was taller than me and dark and walked past me and disappeared. I looked in the hallway and saw my friend William there, I asked him to come here and walk where I see this thing at. I watched him walking in the same direction as the spirit and knew instinctly that this couldn't not have been him because his reflection clearly showed him as he was wearing white and what I saw was black. Tammy also started to say she saw someone in that living room.

Finally one day it was just my boyfriend and I in the house. He was in the back room sleeping and I was watching tv in the second living room. I had heard a popping noise on and off and after ten minutes of it I went to check it. I found that it was coming from the laundry room, the dryer door was popping open. This was very odd because I was washing and drying clothes. I shut the door and restarted the dryer and walked out and was heading towards my bedroom to see if maybe jordan opened the door, when I heard it pop again, I walked back and the dryer door stood open. I asked whoever it was to stop playing games, I needed my clothes done, please, and I shut the door back. I didn't even have to start the dryer back this time it started on its own and I ran to my room and laid down with my boyfriend. After this I noticed that my daughter would go in the laundry room and started to play in there.

I do not understand exactly what is going on, why this ghost moves from room to room or if it's several different ghost or why my daughter feels so attracted to them, but I do know that it's creepy. Do you have children who play with ghosts?

Not Alone in my Dreams,"Hawaii, United States",Succubus / Incubus / Sexual Ghosts,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Succubus / Incubus / Sexual Ghosts :: Not Alone in my Dreams

I don't know where to start... Does anyone else hear that sound? The one that seems to pull you into your dreams, electricity maybe... Like an eerie buzzing you feel and hear when you realize that your body is not falling asleep and is not in a normal dream state. I know this sound so well. I welcome that creepy sound and the feeling of lift or tugging on my insides like something is lifting or turning me, it usually means that I am in for a night or travel or what I feel are visits. Yes visits...

It's been happening for awhile now, but not often. I remember all of them but to explain it in its entirety would just take to long. One experience begins like I described with the sound and the turning, but when I have the ""visitor"" dreams there is an unknown presence there with me, it picks me up and points me in different directions, and it frightens me, but I do not move. I know this is not my dream. My awareness of the situation, I am in bed, I am not in my bed, someone is moving me around. The ""visitor"" has only the outline of a shape but it is big and I feel that this energy is been around forever and has knowledge of everything.

There is a sexual energy also and usually it has its way with me, not always to my disliking. It is not sexual intercourse it is more like a energy force with no boundaries, going under my skin and touching all my nerves with one brush. I can feel it around me sometimes it is heavy on me. It is not here out of curiosity, it is doing a job, it seems, examining me, like I belong to it or something, It is so hard to explain.

The first time it happened I woke up gasping for air and in a panic. I had drifted off for only a few minute in the middle of the day while in the mountains camping with some friends, but they were all out hiking. It was more disturbing then any nightmare, it haunted me for weeks and then I put it out of my mind. Since that time it has happened about six times, always the same thing, pointing me and turning me in the air as I feel weightless when this happens and although it doesn't hurt me I can feel its power and it is a dark energy and sometimes I get scared.

Last night was the last time it happened, I tried to move a little during the examination only to feel pressure on the limbs that moved. I was so awake that I could feel one of my cats jump on the bed next to me where I was laying, I was scared and I felt sick, I started to say the lords prayer out of curiosity and fear but it did nothing, I didn't even get through half of it. I don't know why I am even writing this, the details are so vivid in my mind. I don't really mind when it happens, it fascinates me and I want to stay in my dream even if I am scared.

A Sign that He Can Still Sense Me?,"Virginia, United States",Family / Friends Visits,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Family / Friends Visits :: A Sign that He Can Still Sense Me?

I n 1998, one of my best friends (Billy), passed away from a car accident. We met at work and we became close friends after my boyfriend (Dave) of 6 years passed away from a car accident that involved alcohol. About 6 months after his funeral, I decided to meet up with a friend for a drink after work. She actually knew Billy for several years and we actually met through him.

At the bar, we were just reminiscing about the good times we had with him. Billy worked in our IT department. I told her he used to come in early and do things to my computer/telephone just so I could discover them in the mornings and open a ticket so one of their people, Billy, would have to call and come down to troubleshoot the issues. He also used to send me daily emails saying ""good morning beautiful"". I smiled every time I received them. Well, during me and Leanna's conversation about him, I received a page. Yes, this was back in the days when we carried pagers. The page displayed my direct work line. It was 8pm and no one stays that late at the office. And why would someone call my from my work desk? I called my work number and there was no answer.

The next morning, I asked my co-worker that sat directly next to me if she had paged me from my desk. She said NO. Who paged me... Was it Billy?

Very Little People,Mexico,Non Human Entities,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Non Human Entities :: Very Little People

F or many of the people who come from Mexico you know that Mexico is just filled with ghost stories and myths. For all of you who don't know... Well now you know. There are many many stories and myths told in the town where my parents are from. I have heard about many of them through my parents who have heard these stories from the older women who used to sit around together outside of their houses in the evening telling these supposed ghost stories. One that I heard in particular from my grandmother really caught my interest. This did not happen to me mind you, but I would really appreciate some comments and feed back on this.

My grandma said that when she was little, her mother used to tell her about these tiny little people as in Thumbelina kind of people that were supposedly mischievous and would always steal small personal objects in your house if you weren't careful. Now she said they weren't harmful at all but that they always came when you weren't looking. She blamed the loss of many objects on these little people. My grandmother of course wasn't one to easily believe in such things, until one day later on in her life, she said she happened to come across one.

She said she was just sitting in her house one day (for those of you not familiar with a mexican house, usually the house has a type of court or patio right in the middle where it is open so there is sun and the sky coming in) and she had her eyes closed, just relaxing, when she felt a tug on her pants on one of her legs. She ignored it and kept her eyes close. Again she felt a tug on her pants and she thought it was like a cat or something and when she opened her eyes her shoe on one of her feet were gone. Later that day she found the shoe down where the animals were, by this big door she has leading to a big yard and the town river.

Well this happened again the next day and she said she was determined to catch that cat, only this time after the second tug she opened her eyes and said ""I got you!"" and to her surprise it was a tiny little man almost like a fairy only without any wings or anything. He was running with her shoe! But then he dropped it. She would also tell me that sometimes when they would eat or have dinner they would sometimes leave tortillas on the table in a cloth and later they wouldn't be there any more. One time one of my aunts saw one and ran out of the house across the street to the neighbors house.

Now this isn't my story. But for some reason I feel that there are all types of different things we don't understand and cannot explain. I was wondering if anyone could give me any information on what these little people could be or if they even exist. The two people, my grandma and my aunt had these experiences at different times my grandma having hers first had not told anyone about it until my aunt told her story. Could it be that they both saw the same thing?

Group of my Experiences 2,"Indiana, United States",Psychic / Medium,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Psychic / Medium :: Group of my Experiences 2

H ello there, it's me again, I'm back due to popular demand , ha ha just kidding well here is the rest of my life's experiences so far. Also note this: I don't do drugs, or drink, I made that a personal life long rule of mine, but I am not a religious person, I believe if anything can happen, it will happen. I was baptized but I was kind of forced to, more on that later.

Here is one of the freakiest years of my life. I had written down and noticed a lot of these weird things happening, and I normally looked at my hand for guidance or inspiration. I had to go get baptized one night, as I touched the holy water when I entered and winced because it felt like a slight burning feeling. I shrugged it off because our town's water isn't the best. It was my turn to get my head dunk in the church in this like small sink. I get my head in and suddenly, it's just that I felt like my forehead was on fire. I got up and had a headache. In the morning after that night, I looked at my hands, and noticed that the veins and arties in my hands formed pentagrams. I was a bit freaked out by this so I decided not to go to church because I was pretty sure they did something wrong. Nowadays, I enjoy the marks because people are creeped out a little. Take a nice look at my hand in the palm.

I have nothing except I hear bangings, voices, and I am starting to see shadows and stuff that's not really there.

Here are the two most weird things that happened in my life. The first one happened about a week or so, my mom got me an air soft gun you know for fun, to play with. Well, I went to anime club (which is at a friend's house) with the gun loaded up in a clip, because I was going to show it off. After we played and stuff, I was ready to leave so I called my mom and asked her if she could come get me she told me to call and have my dad try. I called my dad and he was asleep, I called my mom and I begged her to come get me but she said she couldn't and the house wasn't too far so I could walk. (it was fairly close by I just don't like walking streets at night.)

I sighed and me and my friends were talking about our strange experiences and such, and one made (fake) evil warding talismans and wanted me to take one. I said no thank you, as I left I put my air soft gun in my pocket, why I didn't know it just felt like it'd make me feel safe. As I about got home, I was passing by a house I pass all the time, I heard a dog growl and bark as this pure black, almost shadow dog, it started towards me, I got under the street lamp, and pulled out the ground. It was going to attack me and I shot the shadow dog with the air soft gun and that made it worse, so I unloaded the entire clip into the shadow dog, I was yelling/screaming at the time too because I was scared. Suddenly the dog whimpered with the last shot and seemed to vanish. I ran like heck home which was like 5 doors away. I came back in the morning to find my pellets which were bright yellow, there was NO pellets on the ground or anywhere. I asked the neighbors if they heard  an airsoft gun firing, or a dog. They all said no. From that night on I carry a weapon of any type on me at night.

About 2-3 weeks after the dog incident. My friends at anime club wanted to check out this grave at the cemetery. When we got there, I just didn't feel right. We got there, never stepping on the grass because it's rude. I saw these 2 red lights and shadows running along the graves in the shape of dogs. I whispered to my friends. ""We are being hunted... 2 lights..."" My friends couldn't see them and said I was making stuff up. Well we went along the back and was going to head in, there was 5 others plus me, 2 stayed behind, and there was two paths left or right. I started down the left and felt really bad, sick, so I yelled I was going to the right side.

When I did my friends turned around and say that I was still following them on the left path and they couldn't see me on the right path. They said I have a ""I'm going to kill you..."" look on my face and walked towards them with presence. As I was walking on the right path, I didn't want to be alone so I ran back to the left path and the moment I started down the left path, the other me which we all assumed was a shadow doppelganger vanished. They asked me if I was following them, I replied. ""No...I was on the right side and then came back just now..."" They just looked at each other as we left and got on the path to the main entrance, the two ""friends"" that were behind ran up laying that they pee-d on some grave back by the tree as we heard a large howl like a werewolf type howl. We all ran off. That next morning I came carrying a bucket and a sponge and I cleaned up the grave they talked about. I found that really disrespectful and yelled at them, none of my friends had ever seen me that mad.

What hasn't happened, I've seen things, heard lots of bangs, strange dreams, etc.

Save-a-lot Grocery store - I was with my friends from the anime club - the two people, and with new people. Well I was over by the bread and freezer alise as I stopped, along with one of my friends, I stopped and turned around. I could see the outline of a person standing by the bread watching us. As I waved, my friend approached me and said. ""They seemed nice..."" I blinked and laughed a little, I came to find out my friend was like me in a way.

My Dad's house - I was playing with my dog, when I noticed I had a cut on my wrist, I saw the blood and went ""Oh fun, I'm bleeding...ow...ow...ow..."" I got a cloth and wrapped it up, in 18 minutes it healed up, later that night it started to form the scab tissue for it to ""completely heal..."" The strange this is the cut looks like a bite mark, one small fang, and a large one, my dog didn't bite my wrist... So... What did?

The Hallway - This isn't paranormal, but it's just weird, and kind of annoying. Down my hall way, I have a 2nd door to the outside and a blanket covering the window. Light shined in somehow, and I was watching the hall way as the light got covered up by a shadow inside the house. I looked at the blanket which wasn't moving. I just yelled down the hall. ""I prefer light right now do it when my dad is home!"" the shadow seemed to leave as light came in, when my dad came home and started to his room which is past the door, the shadow covered up the light right as he started down. I saw it and just kind of shook my head.

That's about it, I thank you for sharing, please read, and comment. I will submit stories as strange stuff happens. I hope you enjoy my stories and believe me, if not hey that's fine, Those are your choices ^_^

A Knocking in the Closet Cabinet,"Alabama, United States",Ghost Hunting,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Ghost Hunting :: A Knocking in the Closet Cabinet

I t had been a slow week for our little ghost hunting group, when one of our group members told us about this old cabin him and his family used to live in located in Jefferson County. He told us both of his great grandparents had died inside the house, but after he talked to his mom about it, we found out three others had died in there as well.

Josh continued to tell us about what would happen in the house. He said one day he was home alone, and he had made himself a hamburger and left it to cool on the counter, when he came back to get it, a bite had been taken out of it. Then he told us about the cold... Every room in the house was freezing, as we found out the night we stayed there. It was roughly 10:00 at night when we finally made it to the cabin. I stared at it for a moment. Then we realized the doors were locked, leaving yours truly with the task of climbing in through a window to unlock the doors. I stopped and looked around when I got in there... It was dark, and quiet, too quiet, that, ""What the hell happens next..."" kind of quiet.

I ran and unlocked the doors and everyone else came in. Not much happened to begin with, but after we stepped outside for a few minutes to check stuff out, something happened... We came back in and sat in the living room in a big circle with the lights out. We tried talking to the spirits, but nothing was happening. I decided to go and take another look at the kitchen, which all of us had been in earlier, and all of us had left at the same exact time. I come into the hallway and freeze... Every cabinet door stood wide open, even the fridge stood wide open. Everyone came and checked it out, and we ruled out the possibility that it was one of us.

Me and former member Sean decided to stay in the kitchen and try and talk to it. The other 4 members split into pairs of two and went to different rooms. ME and sean stood there for a good five minutes with nothing happening, until both Josh and Adam ran into the kitchen excitedly. They told us that the closet cabinet in the back room was rocking back and forth, and that the vase on the top didn't move with it. They said when it stopped, they tried to recreate it, but the vase moved with it when they tried. So we switched rooms, and me and sean went to the back room. We tried once again talking to it, saying stuff like, ""If you're here, can you give us a sign of your presence?"" sure enough, we got a sign. We were standing about 4 feet away from the closet cabinet, the only light on it was the moon shining in the window next too it, and we hear a knock from the inside, we're like, ""Woah!"" Suddenly, whatever knocked on it punched the inside, so hard that the door actually flexed as if being punched from the inside.

We said some words that would make a sailor blush, then we walked over there to find that there was nothing inside it all, it was empty. Suddenly from the living room we heard josh crying, so we ran to check on him. He sat there, tears rolling down his face as he told us he could hear his great grandfather talking to him...

Jack the Ripper Tour,France,Ghost Tours & Haunted Hotels,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Ghost Tours & Haunted Hotels :: Jack the Ripper Tour

W hen I was visiting my friend in London, we decided to go on a Jack the Ripper tour. So the next morning we decided to sign up for the tour. We decided to go around 11:00 p.m. At the end some people who were on the tour were talking about the restricted area. So my friend and I thought, let's wait until everyone leaves and we'll go in the restricted area.

Finally, after everyone was gone, we went in the restricted area. We took a few pictures by the fireplace and we left. A couple of days later I flew home. After about 1 week I got the pictures developed. I looked and saw a figure of a man standing by the fire place and it was said that the room was haunted by Jack the Ripper's ghost. So I go to my house and showed my Fiance. Then we went to our friend's house. We showed him the pictures. But when we showed him the phone rang like it did in London. So he thought that was weird. He picked up the phone and there was a lady with a British accent. But she said that he called her. My Fiance and

Then the next night our television kept turning on. But the weird thing is it would turn on to shows about the tour. All of these weird things kept happening until finally my Fiance said we had to burn these pictures so we did and all of these weird things stopped.

Ghost at Six Flags Great Adventure Amusement Park,"New Jersey, United States",Apparitions / Voices / Touches,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Apparitions / Voices / Touches :: Ghost at Six Flags Great Adventure Amusement Park

M y boyfriend and I went to Six Flags Great Adventure amusement park yesterday, when we came back to wait for our bus in the parking lot, we were early so we decided to watch Kingda Ka and the Superman coasters to take some pictures. After taking pictures, we were leaning on a white plastic division blocker for cars when my boyfriend kept looking next to him while we were talking. Then from out the corner of my eye I ""saw"" some young white dude in age from 17-23yrs old, about 6'1 standing next to me. He had a curly red or brownish afro and was wearing a red shirt (like a red, black, white lumber jack).

I asked my boyfriend if he saw someone standing next to me he said ""No, but I thought I saw someone SITTING next to me"". Come to find out we saw the same guy, he described him with blue jeans and old black and white converses with a red shirt. Something you would wear in the 80's and 90's, old school gear.

So today I found this on the web: On August 16, 1981, 20-year-old park employee Scott Tyler of Middletown fell from the Rolling Thunder & 8 teenagers who died in the haunted house fire in 1984... I know there are many more deaths probably... I wouldn't be surprised if I seen Scott Tyler but I need a pic of him to tell.

But who ever that was, I know they were a ghost and won't be forgotten by me. I look forward to seeing them again at Fright Fest, since the ghost didn't threaten us, it just seem to be hanging out like it was ""chilling'"" with us. For if it was him (Scott Tyler) I kind of understand why it was next to u,s I'm 21 and my boyfriend is 22, we are around the same age as him when he died.

My Haunted Holiday,United Kingdom,Apparitions / Voices / Touches,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Apparitions / Voices / Touches :: My Haunted Holiday

A few weeks ago me and my mum decided that we should go to my uncle's house for a week, because we didn't have the money to go abroad.

My uncle lives with his wife, Samantha, five month old daughter Paige and very well trained dog Piper.

In the living room they have a window seat at the foot of the couch which is where the encounter took place. One night I was watching tv whilst everyone else was asleep upstairs and Piper was asleep on the floor next to the couch, when suddenly she awoke with a start and started barking at the window seat.

I didn't see anything at first but then I saw it. There was a teenage girl who looked around 15 or 16 years old wearing a vest and shorts, covered in cuts and bruises, she looked at me and I just laid there scared stiff and then I noticed there was blood dripping from her left wrist then she disappeared.

I ran up to my mum's room and told her what happened. Guess what, she thought I was lying until the morning when our uncle told us the people who they had bought the house had a daughter who had committed suicide because of child abuse. Samantha said that she sometimes sees her in Paige's room and the bathroom.

The Four Shadows,United Kingdom,Misc,"M y mom was working at a nursing home at the time. There was a very ill man. And three nurses were in the room. The man was restless and was talking to someone/thing. Sun light was shining through the window when my mom and her friends looked up, there were four shadows instead of three, but it could not be the mans because he was lying down. Maybe someone had come to escort him to the other side, he died shortly after.

When my mom told me this, I went straight to my friend at school and said ""katie you won't believe it!"" and we made a ghost club and that's why I use this web site all the time, I love ghost stories.

I will write another: when I was little, my dad was on nights and I was with my mom in the bed and she locked the door and the windows, not one was open and my mom said one night she heard our wind chimes clanging not in a violent way but in a gentle way.

I will write another now: I was in the kitchen talking to my mom and it did not scare me but a cup fell off the side board and we quite often smell cigarettes when nobody smokes at all. When ever I go on holiday, I always see a black scottie dog, it's not scary but weird. And mom was the doing the house work and when she went up stairs our bedroom lamps were on.

I can't think of a real explanation for these things so that shows that ghosts are real.

Office Block,Spain,Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: Office Block

T his is 100% true, it didn't happen to me, but I can assure you that I've heard if from various sources and think it's interesting to share. The office block where my mother works (I rather not disclose the company name, but I can assure you, that you all know it and have used their products if you have a car), is a relatively new building, constructed under 20 years ago, very modern, all glass on the outside. During its construction, one of the builders putting a windows on the 3rd floor fell out of the building and died.

There are security guards in this building, 24 hours a day, 365 days a year. Keep in mind this is the main office for the Mediterranean sector of one of the most important worldwide companies. During the months after summer (September, October...) at night every day during night watch, guards seem to find the same window that the dead worker was putting in to be open, with an office chair next to it. After moving the chair and closing the window, they find the same thing to happen again in the next watch, another interesting fact is that you need key-cards to access the lifts and they seem to also move up and down constantly being called by and to different floors all by them selves.

Many security staff has left their job because of this, and the head of security seems to reject actually inspecting the 3rd floor. How do I know this? Well I know a few of my mother's work colleagues and she is head of human resources and is a type of person who wouldn't lie about these things, so I know if from her.

The Lady,"Indiana, United States",Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: The Lady

I grew up in a house that was over 100 years old. It had been built from a pre-existing barn, so it was surely older than that. While I was growing up, my babysitters would mention that our house was ""creepy"", and that they'd heard strange noises late at night before my parents came home. I had accepted that doors opening by themselves and strange, unexplained noises were just things that happened in an old house. My opinion changed as I grew older.

One morning, when I was 16 or 17, I was sitting on my bed looking out the windows of my room, when out of the corner of my eye I saw a woman standing there looking at me. She wore a long dark dress with poofy sleeves and her hair was pulled back in a bun. When I turned to look at her, she was gone. Once I heard a woman whisper my name in my ear. Thinking it was my mom home from work, I turned around, but no one was there. I would also clearly hear footsteps come down the hall, into my room and stop next to me. Unsettling. I also heard what sounded like women laughing downstairs. I was alone in the house. I mentioned this to my Mom, but laughed it off. My self doubt changed one summer night when my friends were over.

I had told my mom and some of my friends about what I was hearing and seeing. My mother actually told me that she believed me and said that I was lucky for experiencing something special. I had grown used to the Lady and would sometimes talk to her when I was alone. It made me feel stupid, but I always felt like she was close, and listening. She felt motherly to me. Comfortingly, it felt like she was watching over us. I remember asking her to help me find a missing soccer ball. I had looked all over my room at least 3 times and was going all through the house when out of desperation, I said ""Lady, could you please help me find my ball?"". I chuckled under my breath and thought that I must be going insane. But when I went up to my room, there it was sitting in the middle of my bed. I couldn't believe it. I would catch her peeking in my room to check up on me, I guess.

I never told my sister about the Lady. She was 12 at the time, and I didn't want to scare her. It turned out that she had also met the Lady and my sister hadn't shared my feelings. My girlfriend at the time and some other friends were over one night. We had the lights out and were watching a movie called, ""The House"". It was a cheesy, ghost movie. The movie was about a guy that inherits his grandmother's house. It's haunted she says and tells him to leave. She is standing on a chair with a noose around her neck. She then disappears. She was wearing a long, black dress and her hair is pulled back in a bun. My sister is instantly hysterical. Crying, ""The lady, the lady!"" I looked at her and immediately it dawned on me. She must have seen the Lady too. It sent a shock through me, because now I couldn't deny the reality of what I was experiencing. Later, I gently asked my sister what she had seen or heard. She told me of seeing a woman in a long, black dress walking across her room and disappearing. She'd even heard the sound of the woman's dress brushing the floor. This was incredible! I wasn't crazy! I had assumed all this time that it was my imagination.

Some of my friends became obsessed with trying to see or hear the Lady. They would come over when my parents were out and we would sit in my room being very quiet trying to hear something. I don't remember anything happening that wasn't explainable as something normal. One night, we made a Ouija board out of an old mirror that I'd found in the basement. We used pieces of paper and a shot glass. The glass started moving around, answering our questions. It gave us a name of ""A.J..."" for the name of the Lady. It spelled out that she knew me and that she had died from pneumonia in the 1800's. I can't remember all of the details. I should've written everything down. But in the back of my mind, I suspected one my friends was pushing the glass. I let them freak each other out. I knew that the Lady would never harm us in any way. I wish that I had researched the history of the house to see if there had ever been an ""A.J..."" associated with it.

I graduated from high school and moved out of my childhood home. I felt a sadness and guilt. I wasn't only leaving my parents behind, but also the Lady. I never felt her after I'd left. She is probably still there. My parents have since divorced and moved away. Sometimes, when I come back to my hometown I go by to see the old house. It sat vacant for a long time. I would look in the front-room windows and remember Christmas's and birthday parties. I swear that I felt her staring back at me from the other side of the glass. I hope that the new family living there now has a small child that the Lady can watch over and help them find their toys.

I'm Being Followed by a Ghost,"Missouri, United States",A Haunted Life,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: A Haunted Life :: I'm Being Followed by a Ghost

I was in the 3rd grade when this happened to me and I will never forget it! I was in class and needed to use the rest room so I ask for permission from my teacher and went downstairs to the bathroom. When I walked in as I was passing the stalls I caught out of the corner of my eye a black shape about the same size as myself. I was terrified! I stopped and went to look back and there was nothing there. I left immediately.

A week or so later I went with my class to wash our hands for lunch. I had to go to the bathroom so I went into the first stall while everyone else went on to lunch. I could see on the floor in the stall next to me a pair of tennis shoes and jeans, I thought it was my buddy so I reached out with my foot to kick at his foot, just messing around, I kept reaching but could never get to the foot, I looked back under once more to find nothing there and I had been in the bathroom by myself the whole time.

Soon after having these experiences I started seeing more and more. But not just at school at home too. I live with my mom and little brother. We had been in the house for a few months and I started hearing whisperings and seeing both black and white images floating in and out of the bedrooms, but always disappearing at the doorways.

Then one night I was laying in bed trying to go to sleep when all of a sudden I felt like something was laying on me and I couldn't breathe. My mom came in and tried to help me, she prayed with me and gave me the bible to keep under my pillow. Whatever it was left me alone for the night but seeing the shadows continued.

A couple of months ago my mom had to have surgery on her neck so we had to move in with my aunt and uncle. I swear this thing or things moved right along with me! I'm still seeing the shadowy figures and hearing things.

Is it possible for something to follow you? Because that's what I feel like is happening. I'd really like to tell it to leave me the heck alone but for some reason I don't think that that is going to help. Any suggestions?

Resolving Ghosts' Unfinished Business,"Pennsylvania, United States",Psychic / Medium,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Psychic / Medium :: Resolving Ghosts' Unfinished Business

F or as long as I can remember, I've dreamt mainly of people I don't even know. Some children, some adults, etc. They always came to just me (night or day) and would never leave me alone. At first I didn't know what to make of it all - maybe I was over imaginative or there was something wrong with me? I kept seeing death, war and blood in my dreams - they really bothered me. I became almost afraid to go to sleep and couldn't get my ""imaginary friends"" out of my mind as a child.

I didn't realize back then that they weren't so ""imaginary"" because neither of my parents were the slightest bit open minded to spirituality (and still aren't) and no one took what I saw seriously. My mom thought there was something mentally wrong with me and my dad was just furious I was always up late and talking to ""myself"". But they just kept coming back.

My mom once (when I was about two) told me she saw me fine one minute, the next falling down a flight of stairs as though tripped by some invisible force. (I often have nightmares about falling now) I can't remember, but she says I cracked my skull and had to go to hospital... but strangely, didn't feel any pain. Not everyone I saw was meaning to cause harm. One ghost in particular, Danny, kept visiting me over and over again. I really enjoyed his company.

When I was about seven my little sister was born. That was the time I dreamt of seeing two little blond girls I had never met. After a few years, my sister told me she had a lot of imaginary friends of her own, one of which was named Chloe. Chloe visited her the most often. I, meanwhile, couldn't help but wonder if I was really seeing spirits/ghosts or if I was just crazy. One day at school (when I was either twelve or thirteen) the lights started flickering throughout the entire school - and no one but me to this day knows why. I could have sworn I saw some figures phase out of the room from the corner of my eye right before it happened. Objects in my room were never where I left them and my lights at home kept flickering - even after I changed the bulb. I didn't think they were imaginary, but wanted to make sure.

I soon told my sister how weird it was to see all the lights at school flicker. She smiled and told me: ""Oh, that was just Chloe and her friends, Ellie and Grace."" When she went to describe Chloe's friends, I found those were the girls from my recent dreams! My sister also mentioned Chloe had a brother named Danny. I was stunned to hear her describe him exactly as I had seen him - red hair, hazel eyes, sixteen, etc. My little sister and I talk a lot about spirits and ghosts now. I've found a lot of protection spells and kept talking to Tiffany, my guardian angel. She constantly guides, heals and helps me and was the reason I felt no pain when I fell down the stairs.

Since then, I've been crossing ghosts over, but have found that once they're crossed over, they aren't always reincarnated. Some come back as spirits. I crossed Danny over, but he still comes to visit me. My abilities keep getting stronger through practice and I often set aside time just to meditate, visit the graveyard, etc. Whatever it takes. When I visited the Akashic Records I read that I had always been meant to resolve ghosts' unfinished business. I'm so grateful for this gift and the chance to make a difference!

Crying Teddy Bear,Canada,Psychic / Medium,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Psychic / Medium :: Crying Teddy Bear

S ince I was about 14 until 16 (I'm 24 now), I slept with this teddy bear almost every night because I could always feel the presence of ghosts in my room so it made me feel a little less alone and a little less afraid. It might sound childish but loads of things happened that scared me, such as seeing a shadow rise from the floor, being strangled by a ghost, hearing pig sounds, etc. On a nightly basis it would just be footsteps or a presence though (by the way has anyone heard a very faint electrical sound, or a sound like someone walking on carpet even if there's no carpet there, when you feel a presence?)

I think that because of this stress, I became so attached to my teddy bear so I poured my energy into it; I felt like I just wanted to hide inside the bear. My best friend at the time who could also communicate with spirits (but was really creepy) picked up my teddy bear one day and I knew he could feel something from it. That night like always I fell asleep holding it. But I woke up in the middle of the night to feel something wet against my face. My teddy bear was wet! I figured I'd been crying in my sleep, but I touched my eyes and they were totally dry. I touched around different parts of the bear to see where it was coming from, and only under the eyes were wet! Needless to say that was the last night I slept with a teddy bear!

On another note I was in an antique shop a few weeks ago and although most of the merchandise is really expensive, I saw a traditional Japanese doll (its kneeling down wearing a hat and kimono) for $15. It's 50 years old and is traditionally given to celebrate the birth of a baby girl. The doll could easily be called scary-looking but it has a good ""aura"" if you will. I have really come to believe that dolls are vessels for our emotions and thoughts, which sometimes come to life.

I wondered though, if we can influence dolls like this what about people? I wonder if people can be possessed by the emotions of the living and dead?

The Silent Watcher,United Kingdom,Orbs / Lights / Mists,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Orbs / Lights / Mists :: The Silent Watcher

M y Aunt who lives in the outskirts of Britain, lives with her husband, daughter, and son and law. I go to her house every summer for two weeks. I am normally the last one to go to bed every night. I let the dog out, and while I am making sure he stayed near the house, I spot a light coming from the wood, which is located by the house. I quickly call back the little dog. I go to bed thinking that I must have just been tired.

But as I am drifting off, I feel someone watching me. I look around the room. No one is there. ""Rubbish..."" says my uncle, after telling him what I had experienced the night before. ""But Uncle, I know what I saw!"" I said. ""They're is no one in that bloody wood!"" He had never believed in ghosts. It then felt like every night someone was watching me fall to sleep. I soon started begging my older cousins to let me sleep with them at night. My cousin in law soon got tired of it. ""Fine. Tonight I will take your place. I will go to bed at the same time. I will let out the dog at the same time. If I experience any thing, you will be believed...""

That night, I went to bed with my cousin Amanda. I woke up to a loud blood wrenching scream that pierced the night. I looked up at the clock that was on the bed side. It was exactly midnight. Amanda jumped up and grabbed the gun that she keeps under the bed. I ran behind her, throwing on my night gown that I normally wear over my pajamas. What we see, stop us in our tracks. A huge glowing orb was hovering by the toaster in the kitchen. As we saw it, it slowly disappeared.

I got home the next day. The next summer, I went over again for another two weeks. My older Cousin had died. He was the older brother off Amanda. His name was Scott. He died of cancer. That night, I had a strange dream. I was sitting in a room full of light. Scott walked in, and said, ""You are watched by god little one. You will no longer be bothered by the demon from hell..."" He said. "" I will watch over you for the rest of your days. You are chosen to be my angel..."" I woke with a start.

Down at the end of the bed, a light was shining down with no apparent source. He stood there looking at me with a huge smile. "" I am your guardian Angel young one. I love you..."" Tears where flowing from my eyes..."" I will miss you..."" I said. He held out his hand as though to take me with him as he slowly disappeared. I love you. He mouthed. Then he was gone.

I was afraid to tell anyone about what happened. I was afraid that they would call me crazy. I have always believed in ghosts since then.

Francis,Canada,Psychic / Medium,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Psychic / Medium :: Francis

T his is kind of a continuation of The Man in my Bed . Just to recap from last time, I had a near-death experience when I was 14; since a few months before, there was about 6 good spirits who were frequently around me, as well as some bad entities from time to time. The group of spirits often ""trained"" me; I would do lots of crazy martial arts or soar close to the earth or use my mind to harm entities in my dreams. (It was really fun!)

A month after the near-death experience I moved from the old farmhouse to a suburb of Toronto. For 6 months the spirits weren't around me, but then they slowly started reappearing in my life. I communicated with them like before but tried to balance it with being a ""normal"" teenager.

One day at my new high school, I noticed a guy following me. There was something strange about him. I went into the bathroom and when I came out my friend told me that the guy asked him about me and wanted to talk to me. So I approached him and he seemed normal, but I got strange vibes from him, as if he was into the paranormal too (I'm sure you guys know what I mean, how sometimes you can ""recognize"" one of your own!)

The first week he just talked about computers and school, but then talk shifted to ghosts. I knew it! He could also communicate with ghosts. As a sidenote, 2 months earlier his best friend died from a brain tumour; he was buried in the graveyard around the corner from my house so sometimes me, him (Francis), and his group of friends (who were the sweetest people, and had no idea about our interest in ghosts) went there to visit his grave.

Sometimes I would wonder if I was crazy; sure, we'd all experience things: stuff moving on its own, or being misplaced in strange positions, hearing noises, doorknobs shaking... But what about ""hearing"" and ""seeing"" them? How could I tell if it was real or all in my head? It felt like playing back a memory; you see and hear it in your head, but it feels like its ""broadcasted"" from outside of me.

I had a walk-in closet that I called my Ouija Room. We put a ouija board, a fake human skull, and gravestone-shaped candles on an old antique treasure chest, posters of 36 Mafia or Bone Thugs (who we always listened to because we could relate to their stories about spirits) and fake spider webs around the room. We would sometimes sit in there and meditate or contact spirits. I was used to communicating with ghosts by telepathy so that even if I was in a conversation with a living person, they wouldn't know that I was also talking to a ghost.

I noticed a regular spirit, about 12 years old called ""Smalls"" was acting scared because of a woman spirit he didn't know. Suddenly Francis said ""your friend seems scared of that woman."" THAT was when I knew for sure it wasn't all in my head. He described to me exactly what I saw and heard.

Another time our friends went by the lake to relax. I wandered off alone and was thinking of mermaids; wouldn't it be nice if they were real, I thought. He walked up to me and looked at the water. He said, ""They're real, you know.""

In the meantime, I still kept getting dreams about Keith but he was always different from the other spirits. I could call on any of my spirits at any time and they would come, but not him. Usually in my dreams I was looking for him without any luck, but even when I did find him I could only see the back of him or see him briefly through a crowd, or there would be a glass wall between us. More than dreams of him, I have been dreaming of the same shopping mall since I was a child. I'm almost always running around looking for him. Maybe 3 times in 10 years (having at least one dream every 2 months) I talked to him. When I did he said he loved me, and wonders if we can be together when I die. Another time he gave me a teddybear and told me he wants to see me as an old grandmother with lots of kids. The first time, when I was about 15, he showed me how to cook some grapefruit.

Something was different about him. I just felt a really strong longing and connection with him. I couldn't do anything about it though, I wanted to search for his grave or relatives but didn't know where to start, I had no money for travel or a private investigator. I needed closure but there was nothing I could do, so in the meanwhile...

Francis was creeping me out. I had a dream that a white cat was at our back door, and my sister let it in. It came into my room and started talking to me, I forget what it said but it was really suspicious and creeped me out. But it felt SO real. The next day at school we were walking down the hallway and I mentioned: ""Last night I had a weird dream.""

Well that creeped me out. Plus he wanted to be my boyfriend, even proposed to me in the cemetery one night. But I just didn't have those feelings for him. I had a boyfriend who was living in Florida, and when I tried to call him I would get REALLY nauseous, I had to go outside in the middle of winter to get fresh air. I went to my friends mother who is a ""maroon"" (descendant of slaves in Jamaica who escaped into the mountains, usually know how to tell fortunes and whatnot). This friend didn't know about Francis; when I got my reading she said my best friend has a voodoo doll of me and my boyfriend. She told me how to break the spell, and it worked to an extent but sometimes I still had nightmares that Francis was chasing me. Creepy!

Derby Ghost Lady,"Kentucky, United States",Apparitions / Voices / Touches,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Apparitions / Voices / Touches :: Derby Ghost Lady

I was playing a video game one night a few years ago and around 10:30 pm one night in the living room of my house and I thought I'd take a break and get a bowl of cereal, so I went to the kitchen and made a bowl, and as I was starting back into the living room, I seen a figure of a person sitting in the love seat with there legs crossed. I figured it was just my mom but when I got closer and seen the person better, I noticed that it wasn't my mom, but a young lady maybe in her late 20's or early 30's, with old fashion outfit on that looked like someone would wear at a Kentucky Derby horse race, or in a old western movie. She had a fancy derby type hat on and a really nice looking dress. I turned away for a second just to see if anyone else was in the room with me but no one else was there.

When I looked back at the love seat, she was gone. She never really looked at me, but she was looking toward a display case by the wall in the corner of the room. My mom and me collect old things we find at yard sales and online sometimes. I didn't think about it until now, but maybe she was looking at something in the display case that might use to be hers.

I do live in Kentucky but about two hours from where they have the Kentucky derby. I haven't seen her anymore since then.

Ghost Attack in Dream,Canada,Old Hags / Night Attacks / Sleep Paralysis,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Old Hags / Night Attacks / Sleep Paralysis :: Ghost Attack in Dream

I had a dream last night where I was back in my childhood room and asleep. I was attacked by an invisible force. At first it was gentle - slowly pushing and pulling at my arms. Then it got more violent and pushed me around the room and held me down - pushed me up against the wall and twisted me around the room. I was tangled up in the blankets from the bed as well, but it didn't matter to this entity. It wasn't just holding on to my arms as I could feel pressure all over my whole body at different times.

This went on for a little while and then I was able to find my voice and call for my dad - screaming in between shouts for him. My dad never did come to my rescue in the dream as I woke up before he could. To top it all off, the whole time I KNEW I was dreaming. This all felt like it was happening to me in real life, even though I was in my own bed and not moving. I finally woke up enough to come out of the dream and then shortly after that I thought I felt something grab my ankle while I was awake. I was terrified.

This has happened to me before, but not in the same context as this dream I just had - it's always different. Can anyone shed light on this. It's very scary. I was still scared after I got up, but my wonderful cat hung out with me until I felt better.

I often get feelings that something or someone is watching me. It's been that way for years. I don't know if it's my overactive imagination or not.

The Widow,Cyprus,Apparitions / Voices / Touches,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Apparitions / Voices / Touches :: The Widow

A couple of years ago when I first moved out of my mother's house, I was moving my things to my apartment slowly, like a couple of things a day until I had moved all the big stuff like bed, study, couch and I was left with the little things like books etc. I decided to get a couple of days off to take the rest of my stuff so one morning, as I was packing the last of my things, I decided to take a break and smoke one last cigarette on my parents' porch. I sat on the chair with my legs between my arms and I was smoking and watching the street.

As I was about to put off my cigarette, I saw our neighbour, an old lady who always wore black (tradition in Cyprus after someone's husband dies) coming from her back yard towards the front door, I tried to wave at her because I hadn't seen her in a long time but she never turned her head up to see me, so I thought, oh well, I'll say hello another time and I went inside to carry on with my business.

That afternoon, my mother and I were having our usual coffee and I told her that I'd seen our neighbour earlier that day, she asked me which neighbour I was talking about, and I explain that it was the one who lives across the street from us, that widow! She started looking at me in a weird way, so I said ""what""? She asks me if I was sure and I said ""yeah 100% why?""

She told me that she had died weeks ago! So it couldn't be that I saw her... I swore to her and I asked her why she hadn't told me that the neighbour had died when she died, she said that she thought she had told me... And we weren't that close with her so maybe it slipped her mind. The good thing is that she believed me, but that was the only time I saw her.

The Strange Room,"Nebraska, United States",Poltergeists / Physical Manifestations,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Poltergeists / Physical Manifestations :: The Strange Room

I just returned from a business trip to Kansas City Missouri. The seminar I attended was at a very old but lovely hotel in the area. I chose to stay in the same hotel to keep the expenses down for the clinic, you know, not have to get a rental vehicle or transportation. The rooms were absolutely lovely and very clean. I felt very comfortable there.

My first night, there was a problem with the air conditioning. In my room it reached 93 Fahrenheit. No way to open a window for a breeze either as these are all sealed. So, it was a very restless night.

The second night, the air conditioning was repaired and it was very comfortable. As I returned to my room later in the evening after going for a walk, I was very tired having not slept much the night before. I have traveled pretty regularly with my career, so hotels do not bother me. I generally do not have a problem sleeping, especially after some good fresh air from a walk.

As I lay down to go to sleep, I was relaxed, looking forward to the next day sessions and a good night's sleep. I remember looking at the bed side clock; it was 11:30 PM. I clicked off the remote for the television and probably was fast asleep before laying the remote back down. I awoke to knocking at 2:00 AM. It took a moment for me to orient to where I was when I awoke. I got up from the bed and was making my way to the door of the room to peer through the peep hole. There was nothing there.

As the fog of sleep cleared a bit, I chalked the noises up to dreaming and lay back down to sleep. Just as I closed my eyes, the knocking sounded again, but it wasn't coming from the door. It was coming from the wall behind the bed. I got up and went around the wall, the bath room was on the other side and there was nothing there. I thought about it briefly and decided that the hotel was full of visitors as there were many seminars being held there. The knocking was surely echoing from the hall or other rooms. I lay back down.

By this time I was wide awake. And thought that I needed to relax and get comfortable. I was exhausted and needed to rest to be alert for morning. I sat up in bed to arrange the pillows. I was just sitting there for a moment fussing with the pillows and blankets/ I was ready to lie back down, and the glass I had left on the night table across the room moved. It didn't just slide. It lifted off the table about 2 inches, moved to the right about 4 inches and sat back down gently on the end table. I thought, 'Okay, that was strange.'

I lay back down and closed my eyes, willing myself to relax. Again, I heard knocking. From the same area as before. I sat up and looked around. Now there were 2 glasses sitting on the night stand, but they were moved about 18 inches from where I had left the one glass before.

I heard a faint giggle, probably female. I don't think it was in the hallway as it didn't sound muffled faint, it sounded more of a whisper. I thought to myself that I could not afford to miss a night's sleep, whatever was going on, I needed to sleep. I turned on the television lowly and lay back down.

I awoke at about 4:15 AM to more knocking. By this time I was disgusted. I got up, used the restroom and went back to bed. As I laid back down, I looked across the room. Now the 2 glasses were on the floor. I went over picked up the glasses, moved them onto a desk across the room, as I was doing this I was mumbling how I wasn't putting up with this tonight I was tired and that was that. There were 3 very sharp raps behind the bed and then nothing, or at least nothing that woke me up.

Ouija Board and More Weird Happenings,"New York, United States",Ouija Board / Seances,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Ouija Board / Seances :: Ouija Board and More Weird Happenings

R ecently, I went on vacation and during the week I was away, my friend, Paige, cared for my cat, dog, and house. A few days ago, when I came back, Paige came over to hang out, and she brought up that two days after we left, Paige came to my house and the radio and the TV upstairs were both on, blasting music and sound. She didn't leave either of them on the day before, and neither did we when we left.

I don't own a Ouija board, but we searched ""How to Make Your Own Ouija Board"" and found a good web site. We followed the steps, using a magnifying glass as the pointer. I was really skeptical, at first, because it wasn't a real Ouija board. We asked, ""Is anyone there?"". For the first second, nothing happened. But then it started to shake and slowly move to ""Yes"". I looked at Paige, but I could tell by her face that she wasn't moving it, and I most certainly wasn't! Plus, there's a difference when you're moving it and a ghost - or whatever we were talking to - is! It told us his name was Ron, he has a sister named Agatha, and he died in a fire. We were getting different dates every time and it was hard to understand them. The real question was, were we really talking to someone?

Since we used the Ouija board, other weird things have been happening, not just the usual. The other night, I was laying in bed, and it felt like someone was sitting on my bed. I looked to see if it was my dog or cat, and it wasn't. I could see the imprint of someone sitting there.

I was doing my hair in my mirror and I heard my bed creak, like someone was getting on it. I looked, and, again, no one was there.

Also, I got a charm bracelet while on vacation. I would put it on my wrist so that I could hook it myself, but every time I got close to the clasp, it would fall, which would make no sense. Finally, I expected maybe the ghost (if there is one) was doing it. I said, ""Stop it, please!"" The next time I tried, I got it on. Also, I bought 2 necklaces the other day at the mall, and both of them broke without explanation. The chain would crack. I wasn't sure why this was happening. Is it because I threw out the makeshift Ouija board?

Does anyone know how a Ouija board works? Or why this is happening? It hasn't been anything serious - yet.

Spirit Entering my Body while Asleep and Vivid Dreams,"North Carolina, United States",Misc,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Misc :: Spirit Entering my Body while Asleep and Vivid Dreams

I 've all ways thought of myself as a regular guy, and did guy things. I go the work each day, and after work when I have time, I would play ball, and hang out with the fellows, and drink beer you know, normal stuff. At the end of the day from time to time I couldn't help, but to think about my nights...

I had fallen asleep one night like any other night, and almost immediately I found myself sitting in the back of a car. At the time it seemed so real to me, but there I was sitting in the passenger rear the car was moving and, there were three shadows in the car just sitting there motionless: I tried to make out who they were, their faces were unrecognizable, that is when sixth sense kicked in and, the only way for me to explain to you. It's like closing your eyes and, feeling a presence, if someone is standing next to you.

I felt the presences of my dead Grandfather at the wheel, and my dead Grandmother seating in front of me, and my dead Father was beside me in this car. As I looked around I could see that it was night and, a vividly clear night it was. It seemed that I could see for miles when my attention focused back on the three spirits that were setting in the car they were sitting there still, and motionless; Fear had sat in and, I panicked and, screamed out to them ""LET ME OUT"" and, the car pulled over, to a corner and, I jumped out.

Now as I stood there on the curb of the street I noticed something else, the streets were wet, and the smell of rain was in the air, as I walked toward a light pole the street gleaned like diamonds, I then felt a feeling of false security, or you can say that I was happy to be out of that car but, in the back of my mind I knew I was on the other side and could not get back on shear will alone. What I really thought was, I had died and, was alone in another world. Of all the thoughts that were racing through my mind I felt that I had to move on to find a way out of this living nightmare.

Turning toward a small shop that I had spotted on the opposite corner I walked in and, there was only one man inside, at the time not, knowing what to say to this guy, I started small talk asking him about the place as I looked around and, it appeared to by an antique store and, it smelled just like it looked OLD. As I started out the man asked me if I wanted to buy something for my home. I was thinking to myself at this point, I don't know where my home was and, It was like I had lost all memories of my life and, I surely did not know there I was. No! I said as I was walking out but, changed my mind when I saw two familiar figures standing at the other end of the store.

With an intense stare they were standing there motionless; and, left no doubt in my mind it was my Grandmother and Grandfather looking at me and, that man was trying to keep me in the store well... He was my dead Father's spirit. All I could think of, it was time to run so, I ran out the place and, I wasted no time to get back on the street. Now! Where will I go I thought to myself? There was a parking lot across the street so, I went back to where I had started. At a distance I saw a bar and, there were two maybe three people standing in front as, if they were waiting on me to walk over there. NO! I thought to myself I had to get out of this nightmare! So, I ran, again and found myself looking back at a man standing in front of this bar with that same intense look just like the others in the store. I then approached an alley! ""I'm safe"" I thought after cutting through the alley onto another street. Looking up then down this street ""I'm safe, I'm safe thinking to myself as I looked up, and down this empty street. That's when I noticed there only apartments on this street,

I walked up to the nearest door that I had come to and, without knocking I walked in. Oh my God in Heaven where am I? The smell, the place smelled like an old, wool military blanket. There I stood waiting for my eyes to adjust to the poor lighting. Directly across from me was the living room and a very skinny old man lying on a sofa, he appeared to be lifeless at first. Then the old man suddenly jumping, from the sofa and ran at me saying ""You don't know how to speak when you come into someone's house?"" Scared I knocked the old man to the floor; he gotten up as quick as he went down and in my face before I could react. Maybe only six to eight inches from my face he stood. The face! He had NO face; and the eyes less sockets sent my mind into shock.

I was more frightened then I was scared and out of fear I dug deep inside myself for the courage to ask this corpse who he was? Standing in my face he said ""I am your uncle"" Then he stepped back in silence, my mind started racing again, I knew who he was, he was the spirit of my dead Father. Then I asked him. ""How can you see me you haven't many eyes?"" ""How can you speak you haven't a mouth""? As I took two steps back the thoughts of running was on my mind once more.

Now! I'm thinking very hard at, this point nothing is making sense to me now. I'm dead for sure. Then out of the corner of my eye she just appeared. A little girl manifested out of nowhere and walked then stood between the corpse and myself, saying nothing, she just stood there for maybe a minute in silence. I then studied her very closely what she was wearing, and her face and, everything I could take in to give a clue of who she was. I looked into her pale white face and her eyes had shown, a lot of sadness and I felt sadness and I felt distress and the feeling of being trapped and helpless. This little girl was feeling all of these things and I felt sorrow.

My attention fell back on what she was wearing, she was clothed in a yellow dress with a big rounded white collar a dress that could that could have quite possibly came out of the forties or fifties era. The two blonde pony tails on the sides of her head swayed as, she turned, and quietly walked away right through the front door, literally.

My attention fell back on the old man I guess it was time for jokes, the old man asked me for a glass of water. To me there was nothing funny about the situation I was in as, I stood there for maybe a few seconds or more when I decided to find the kitchen. Before I reached the kitchen I noticed a curtain covering a closet pulled, back the curtain and looked inside and the smell, wow! It was like those cloths, they had appeared to be there for a very long time maybe fifty years. Someone then gently grabbed me by the shoulder. First I thought it was the old man when I turned to look a woman in a soft voice. ""You're not supposed to look in there"" She could have been around sixty years old. ""The Glasses are in the sink"" she said.

That was the very last of this ordeal before awakening. I've tried to make heads or tails of all this and I'm quite sure that this is called dream interruption and it is caused by a spirit that has entered the body and mind through the soul while the person is sleeping and, in a semi-subconscious state.

Waking Up with Bites and Scratches,"Florida, United States",Misc,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Misc :: Waking Up with Bites and Scratches

I 'm new here, but I would say that I'm not new to the paranormal. Since I was quite young I have had a large number of strange unexplainable feelings and experiences that I cannot even begin to recount. But recently things have been happening to me personally (in the past it's been observations... Seeing things or hearing things, but it never felt as if whatever I was seeing was trying to communicate with me), and frankly it is beginning to worrying me.

So, these are the two stories I would like to share with you all today. Any advice or answers or comments will be greatly appreciated.

Recently I have been having a lot of trouble sleeping. Two nights ago, I was taking my dog outside to go to the bathroom at around 3am, and I was still fully awake at the time. Nothing was out of the ordinary at first, but then my dog stopped still and sat down, making a faint whining sound. This was not entirely unusual for him, so I didn't pay it much attention and walked forward, telling him to hurry up and do his business.

I noticed it was cold out, which is certainly odd for Florida at this time of year. But again, I wrote it off, since I knew there had been a storm that day and thought maybe it had just brought cold air. A couple minutes later, I noticed the form of a person standing near the man-made pond diagonally left from my house. I squinted my eyes to see better, thinking maybe it was one of my neighbors was outside. It seemed the person was staring at me, though I could see no eyes or specific facial features, I felt I was being watched. But as I walked forward to inspect further, it disappeared.

Now, I'm not positive it was something paranormal... But something just didn't feel right about the whole thing, so I just thought I'd share it here.

But on another topic, I could use some help. My problem as of late is that I sometimes wake up with scratches, cuts, and swollen bites (like insect bites). I have checked every possible explanation, and I can't find anything that could be causing it. Just to be sure I wasn't out of my mind, I invited my friend over to my house about a month ago to spend the night. She and I slept in the same room, and I woke up with small swollen bites and scratches on my arms and back, but she was not scratched or bitten. I don't understand. What is happening to me? I mean, I've felt things weren't always right in this house before, but this is the first time anything like this has happened. I should say in the interest of full disclosure, that I have heard strange things and seen figures in my house before, but as I said at the beginning of this message, I never felt before that they were trying to harm me or communicate with me.

Strange occurrences like this have become common themes lately for me, and I'm not scared, but I am confused and a little worried. What is going on? And will it get worse?

People in the Garage,"Missouri, United States",Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: People in the Garage

T his creeps me out even thinking about it 17 years later... But here is my story of ""the people in the garage..."" from the time I was 6 until I was 8 my family lived in this little old farmhouse right next to both of my grandmothers. When I was a very small child, 2 little girls lived there with their parents, we played and went trick or treating together, fun times. The family split up and the girls had no contact with the father, who always seemed very nice - they all moved out, we move in. A weird situation for that family, I'm sure.

I remember being scared in their bedroom, but I don't remember why. When my family moved into this house, the room the girls shared was my bedroom. I hated playing by myself in that house, and my parents room was especially spooky. I would always close their door if it was open, and we shared a bathroom that could be accessed from either bedroom - I always made sure those doors were closed, too.

We had a scary little cellar, and just a bunch of weird outbuildings and things typical of old rural farmhouses. Everyone was uncomfortable, there was a weird feeling in that house, always. No one really said anything, though until after my brother was born.

I was 7 years old, we shared a room when he was born. My mom came in to check on him one night, and I was SPEAKING FRENCH in my sleep! I still don't speak french - so it's not like I could control it! My mom asked me the next morning what I dreamed about, and I told her ""the people in the garage. They always talk like that..."" very creepy - I guess I told her more than once about them - and I vaguely remember a woman with dark hair and red lipstick, but that's it.

We moved out VERY soon after that, and the father of those 2 girls moved back in, by himself. He started fixing up the house, he even got a puppy from us when our dog had puppies... A few months later, people started noticing no one had seen him in a while, someone decided to go over there and it looked like no one had cared for the dog in a while, which was very unusual for him.

So, someone decided to investigate - and found his body in the GARAGE! He had shot himself in the head - in the garage - and had been there about 2 weeks before anyone found him.

On a happy note, my grandma took in the dog who lived another 15 years...

The Little Girl Won't Leave Him Alone,Mexico,Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: The Little Girl Won't Leave Him Alone

T his is a recent story. This happened to my cousin's soon to be husband. We were sitting in my living room yesterday watching TV, when there was a little segment on this show having to do with the supernatural. My cousin and I started to discuss the segment and what it was about and somehow we got into a conversation about things that we had heard happened to people in our family as well as to us.

Well she told me that her husband has an aunt and she used to play the Ouija board all the time and she said that all of a sudden a little girl would start to appear to her and wouldn't leave her alone, so she asked him if he could help her burn the board to get rid of it. Turns out it wasn't such a good idea. My cousin said that they would be in his grandma's house (because that was where they were staying at the time) and he would not be able to sleep at night. Every single night around midnight he would feel the need to take a walk.

One day my cousin told him that she wanted to take a walk with him. He told her no. Then she said that she wanted to go with him to accompany him and he just wouldn't let her. As a matter of fact he locked her in the room to keep her from going with him. Then one day he told her not to let him go out to take walks no matter what he did. She asked him why and he finally told her that he kept seeing the same little girl his aunt was seeing, that she was scary and had torn and tattered clothes and she was purpleish and she kept calling him and calling him. My cousin insisted that he was dreaming, having the feeling that he wasn't.

One day his grandma was praying and he ran out and she asked him why he was leaving and he wouldn't respond. Then later on at night my cousin locked the door to the room and around midnight they heard a knocking at the door to the room. My cousin was about to answer it when her husband told her not to. She said ""well what if it's your grandma?"" And he said, ""No it's not her trust me just don't open the door to anyone"". Again they would hear knocking at the door and again he would tell her not to open it. Then his grandma came to the door and was calling them and asking them if they had knocked on their door because it sounded like someone was trying to knock the door down and they told her they hadn't. Finally his grandma decided to do a type of religious ritual where a person sort of massages the whole body while praying into the ""posessed"" person's ear to ward off any evil spirit.

My cousin said that sometimes they had to have two people holding him down because he would start yelling and screaming terribly. He would warn others to get away because the little girl was getting angry. My cousin said eventually things stopped happening but that he still wakes up in the middle of the night telling her that he dreamt about the little girl.

My question is what does this little girl want from him? How can he get rid of her permanently? He is my age, 20 years old, this is a big burden for him to carry and who knows how long he will continue to carry it. I want to know if there is any way to help?

Family Reunions Are Not Always Fun,"Missouri, United States",Psychic / Medium,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Psychic / Medium :: Family Reunions Are Not Always Fun

T his always happens to me. First off, I used to work in nursing homes, and whenever someone died, I would always have a dream about that person. Not even that they died, just they were a significant part of my dream. Even when I was on vacation in chicago for a week and someone died suddenly at work, I had a dream about them. Weird.

Onto the family stuff. I keep having dreams where I'm going somewhere with or being visited by my grandma or aunt. Sometimes both. But my aunt has been dead for 14 years, and my grandma for 3 years. Usually these dreams are not scary, its just perfectly normal in dreamland to go shopping with the dead. And I know they are dead in these dreams, but it's not weird. But every once in a while I will have a dream where they are gross and corpsey, and it IS scary. It's like I'm somewhere I shouldn't be, or else they are. Sometimes they will warn me about stuff, or tell me to ""take care of myself""  they don't wish me any harm, but I go to hug them goodbye and they are skeletons!

Another time, in a totally isolated incident, I was visited by ""extended"" family (as in from the 1840's). This was right after I had my son, like everyone was coming to see the baby. I had the most horrible chill in my spine, so bad it woke me up, but I was paralyzed and could hear people talking about my baby. This was terrifying, but that's the only time that has happened.

Have You Ever Seen a Ghost Sitting in a Restaurant?,"New York, United States",Family / Friends Visits,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Family / Friends Visits :: Have You Ever Seen a Ghost Sitting in a Restaurant?

I went to my friend's house over the weekend to sleep over. My other friend was invited so we all went out to Ruby Tuesday's. We talked, ordered our food, went to the salad bar, and sat right back down. But in those five minutes when all of that happened, I could have sworn I saw someone that I saw recently like ten minutes ago.

I know, your thinking, ""She probably just saw someone in a car who was happening to go to the same restaurant..."" Hello, remember, this is a ghost experience!

Before we left my friend's house she showed me a picture of one of her uncles. He was maybe 90 or so. Looked pretty old. Sort of short and bald. So when we sat down at the table and was talking, I could see a man who looked exactly like her uncle at the table just few sections down. When we ordered our food, I looked at him again and saw him again but a little different. He looked see through. I wanted to point him out but I didn't want to say anything rude if it wasn't actually him. When we went up for the salad bar, I watched the ghostly man get up and walk over to my friend (she's the one who has the uncle). She hates salad so she just sat there. But the guy was sort of talking to her. She didn't know what he was saying, or even know that he was there. Then he sat at his seat again. When I sat down I looked over to see if he was there, but he vanished!

After we left I didn't see any more strange things. But 2 days later, I was on AIM (AOL Instant Messenger) my friend IMs me and says ""Do you know my uncle?"" I said no. She says ""Oh, well, he died on Saturday. At night. He was about 90 and I haven't seen him in 3-4 years..."" Although I was sad about her loss in the family, I was shocked!

Like I heard in many other stories about an occurrence like this, I still thought it was shocking!

Who Were the Drake's Really?,"New Jersey, United States",Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: Who Were the Drake's Really?

S ince El Coyote was visited by TSPRGHOSTS , we've had many guests come in and inquire about our 'residents'. You get used to that after a while. Most people love the stories that we've experienced and want to hear more but nothing prepared me for what a contractor and his wife told me after they asked about what we've experienced.

Two towns over from us is Chester, NJ. You can feel its history by driving through it. The buildings are old and immaculately preserved. Chester was first established on the intersection of two major Lenape Indian trails. These trails were used for hundreds of years before Chester became 'official' in 1799.

In 1810, Mr. Zephania Drake and his son Jacob erected the The Brick House. It was used as a stagecoach stop when mining had begun and immigrants came into work.

Over the next century or so, mining cooled and Chester became a sleepy little town. The Brick House closed its rooms and became a restaurant only. The Publik House. Craft shops popped up next to Taylor's Ice Cream, Halloween parades, antiques etc.

Over the last year give or take, it had been closed. Here's where the contractor comes in. He asks about Coyote and dances the issue. Then he tells me and Billy. Apparently, the inn was in horrible disrepair. The new owners wanted to raze it, the historical society wanted to save it. It led to late hours, after closing with just him, his wife, and the electrician to figure out whether the building could be saved or not.

One night, they went upstairs to where the rooms used to be. Digging in, they found oil lamps, candle sconces and a bible with Zephania's name in it. Old stuff! Beds and all. His wife quoted me the psalm from the bible but I can't remember it. When they came back downstairs, all the tables in the dining room were upset. Chairs were knocked over, silverware was strewn about. Doors were opened and the dining rooms were freezing.

Despite that, (I'm sure they were more than intrigued) they decided to stay on the job. Late night again, the contractor was alone reviewing whatever contractors review and he heard footsteps upstairs. He went to investigate but as he hit the stairs he felt something move straight through him. He told us he lost his breath. It was like being hit in the stomach with a bat. He told us of voices he heard when when they passed through him, a girl's voice. There were no words, just a female pitch and then nausea.

After that, he called it quits. I guess they found someone else to restore it. It's there today although the decor is starker and attempting to be more chic. Good news! They reopened the rooms.

So? Who were the Drake's? I've HEARD that Mr. D junior was not such a gentleman. I HEARD of his likings for young lithuanian immigrant girls that came to work for him. I've HEARD of one dying in his employ. However, despite recent research I could not find any evidence of such happenings.

Indian trails? Maybe burial grounds? Murdered girls? Just once I would love to know the stories behind these places. I plan on staying there soon. Maybe one day my nonbeliever hubby will get it.

Tall Dark Figure with a Small Leaf-like Clasp,"Indiana, United States",Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: Tall Dark Figure with a Small Leaf-like Clasp

I n 2004 we moved to a little town about 20 miles south of where we had already lived. The first year there was uneventful other than the strange noises and voices. But that isn't what I'm going to tell you about. It starts about halfway through the second year of living in this house.

One night I was going to bed and all was fine, from my bed I could see the light outline the door from the hallway. I fell asleep around 11pm. Around 2am I wake up and notice that the light was still on in the hall way, but I couldn't see all of the light. As my eyes were adjusting to the room I noticed that there was a tall ""man"" standing in front of my door and that was blocking the light. It was staring at me. All I could notice was that it had black hair and it was wearing a black hooded cloak. I also noticed that it had a small leaf-like clasp holding the cloak on. The clasp glowed with an unnatural light.

As this thing stood there staring at me I lay there frozen in terror. The thing started to raise its hand towards me and walk towards me in bed. Just as it took its first step my bedroom door swings open and hits it and it turns into smoke and floats up to and through the ceiling. In the doorway stands my younger sister. She asks me what I wanted and I told her I didn't say anything and she said I called her name. Then she turned to walk away and turned back and said that she was going to ask me something but that she forgot. And she went back into the living room and finished watching her movie. I couldn't sleep the rest of the night.

The second encounter happened about 3 or 4 nights ago. This is an entire 3 years later. My room is now in the basement. I was sleeping and I wake up around 3am and as my eyes focus I notice a tall dark figure standing by my closet staring at me and I notice that it had the same clasp as the one 3 or 4 years ago. This time, not as freaked out, but still slightly frozen, I sit up in bed. This thing is still looking at me so I grab my phone which has a built in flashlight and I turn it on him and he turns into smoke again and floats up through the ceiling. I quickly turn the light on in my room and see that it was 3 in the morning. I stayed up the rest of that night.

if anyone out there has any info about what this thing is and why it is haunting me I would much appreciate it.

My Haunted House,Poland,Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: My Haunted House

H i everybody it's me again. I live in a house in Poland that was built by my father and my grandfather. It is a big house and has a lot of windows and doors and a lot of antiques. I believe in the paranormal and for about two years I have been learning more about the paranormal (a lot from you guys and ladies). I just learned maybe 2 months ago that my house is haunted!

I watched a lot of ghost tv shows and read a lot of books and was freaked about it but I never realized that weird things were happening in my house. I have been living in that house for 10 years and a lot of strange activities have happened during that time. I believe that my house is haunted maybe because my mother died in that house from cancer and that we were kind of forced to move into that house. My Father wanted to live there very much with my mom and me being 14, I could not live anywhere without my parents (We moved from Canada).

The first experience I had was just maybe 3 weeks from moving in. I was hearing someone walking up the stairs but never seen anyone there. I thought then it was mice. I remember watching tv one day and it was maybe around 3:00 pm so it was daytime. I had the door to my living room slightly open and I noticed that the door swang open very fast. I thought that someone opened a window but nobody was in the house. I thought that the door would slam against the wall and as it got just about a couple of inches to the wall, it just stopped and started to close but very slowly. I was shocked but to tell you the truth I laughed a little bit and stopped thinking about it.

Some time later, I don't remember, maybe a year or 2, I went to a bar with a couple of friends. We sat there and watched a football game and had 2 beers. Nothing more! I took a shower and decided to go to bed. I fell asleep but something woke me up in the middle of the night. I looked up and saw a black shadow coming up to my bed. His hands were ready to choke me. I felt so scared that I tried to scream but I couldn't, but I just put the blanket over my head. And waited for a while and then decided to see if that shadow was there but it wasn't.

I was freaked and decided to sleep with the light on. My sister laughed at me because I was already 17. My wife actually told me the house was haunted. She said that she went outside on day to feed the dogs. When she was coming back to the house she noticed that all of the windows were wide and were opening and closing. She swore that when she left the house everything was closed. I thought that maybe she forgot to close one of the windows. I actually didn't, I think it was a ghost.

But the scariest thing happened 2 months ago that made me believe that my house was haunted. My wife and sister in law were watching a ghost tv show. I love teasing my wife about ghosts and she kept telling me to shut up. While we were watching the ghost tv show, my sister in law said she has to go to the washroom. She came back and we started to watch another episode when suddenly something smashed. We were all freaked. We decided not to move for at least 5 minutes.

After that I decided to check it out. I opened the door to the washroom and the mirror fell off the wall. I don't think there is a way that it would fall by itself. Nothing weird has happened lately but a week ago my step mother and dad decided to go and visit my sister in Canada (she moved back). He took some pictures of the house because he bought a lot of antiques and made the house look so nice. I was looking at the pictures and noticed that on some pictures there are orbs. And on one picture there are 3 orbs. I don't know if this could be made by a reflection or something but I do believe these are orbs.

I believe that some of you think this is a real haunted house but it's still hard to believe in it. Is it possible? Do you think it could be my mom? I'm catholic and I believe she is waiting for me in heaven not at home. But is it possible?

Slumber Party Scares,"Illinois, United States",Apparitions / Voices / Touches,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Apparitions / Voices / Touches :: Slumber Party Scares

T his story took place when I was about 14. I'm 22 now and the memory still scares the crap out of me. My friend had a huge slumber party for her birthday. Her house was very old and was rumored to once be part of the underground railroad. Her attic was a series of rooms that mirrored here downstairs except for one that had a whole cut out of the floor. It looked like a tunnel led from it and went about 3 feet back before it was blocked off with rubble and bricks. She would always tell us stories of weird stuff that happened in her house. Her room had the stairs to the attic attached to it and she would hear sounds coming from up there like people walking around and once her electric keyboard that was up there went off on its own. It was playing ""Oh Susanna"" on repeat which is kind of strange because here name is Susan.

We, being a bunch of teenage girls, decided to play that silly game ""Light As A Feather, Stiff As A Board"". We were all sitting around in a circle with candles concentrating on getting this girl to float when the stuff hit the fan so to speak. All at once the room we were in dropped in temperature and the candles all flicked at once, like there was a breeze in the room which there wasn't. We all screamed and jumped up. We all piled on her couch (there were at least 10 of us so you can imagine.)

That's when we heard a loud boom come from the coat closet / entryway connected to the room we were sitting in. Almost at the same second a dark shadow ran around the wrap around porch. We watched it move through the windows and at one point it passed right by where we were all sitting. We didn't hear the sound of anyone running though which was odd. It stopped at the front door and that's when we realized that the door wasn't locked. Not that it would have really mattered.

But still I decided to be the brave one of the ones on top of the pile of girls and jumped up and ran and locked the door. When I did this I could clearly see out the window and no one was there, human at least. I flicked on the lights on the way back to the couch and slowly we got our nerves back. Eventually we opened the door the the coat room / entry way and saw that her coat wrack had been knocked over by something. None of us slept that night and needless to say I never spent the night at her house again.

The Mysterious Hotel Ghost,"Kentucky, United States",Apparitions / Voices / Touches,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Apparitions / Voices / Touches :: The Mysterious Hotel Ghost

I n Kentucky there is a bar in the city I visited in. It was a very popular bar too. I was age 12 at the time. It was a bar that lets anyone in. I was leaving the bar heading to the parking lot and I felt someone following me, I even heard the footsteps too. I quickly turned back, I expected someone to be behind me but I thought I was hearing things, I got in my friend's car to go to the hotel I was saying in and I felt a touch on my right shoulder. I told my friend to stop touching me but she said it wasn't her.

I went home and ran upstairs to go to bed. I looked in my bed and I saw someone in it, I ran downstairs to my mom's room but she was too tired to answer me. We stayed in a fancy hotel room, it had one big room where you sleep and a small tv, a little kitchen with a mini fridge, a small wooden table, a window, a bathroom and that's about it. I have felt experiences in that hotel like the visitor. Someone came in the hotel at night and just watched us sleep.

I do know my cousin has been gone about 2 years now and left his old cap here, I have been keeping it a while. Do you think that has anything to do with it? Will you be able to give me advice? Well if you do happen to thanks.

Saturday Morning Cartoons,"Texas, United States",Non Human Entities,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Non Human Entities :: Saturday Morning Cartoons

W hen I was a young child the best thing in the world was waking up early on Saturday morning for cartoons. At 6 o'clock on Saturday the first thing that they would show was ""Mr. Peppermint"" along with his right hand puppet Muffin and after that was over, they would start showing the good stuff like He-man and Transformers. Clearly I was a child in the era of good cartoons before pokemon took over the world.

The child in me loves to sleep and I was no different when I really was a child but I loved my cartoons and would wake up early without an alarm clock on Saturday to partake. One morning this ritual placed me in a strange situation coming face to face with something in a rear bedroom of our house. Being the first person awake that morning and being only 5 or 6 years old at the time, being stealthy was important because if Mom or Dad caught me they would send me back to bed and I would miss some of my shows! I remember getting out of bed and creeping down the hallway to our front room where the television was located. Turning on the television and finding the right channel for Mr. Peppermint to be doing this thing.

I watched Mr. Peppermint and muffin argue for a few minutes and then heard a soft noise coming from the rear of the house. I don't know why but I went back down the hall towards my bedroom but I did and looked further down the hall towards an unused bedroom at the very end. I thought that I heard something moving in there and since I did have a small dog, I thought maybe Phoenix was in there.

I walked into the darkened room and to my horror saw a bright green mass with a face floating above the furniture in the room. My parents had been using this room for storage since me and my brother were at that time young enough to share a room. The mass turned towards me and had this startled expression as if I had scared him. I assume from the face that it was a male but after all these years I don't remember specifics about the face. I ran for my bedroom and got back in bed and did what all little kids do when they are terrified and pulled the covers over my head. If you pull the covers over your head it stops any monsters from being able to touch you through the ""blankie-forcefield"".

I stayed there for hours until I heard my parents get up and they asked me if I had turned on the television because it was still on in the living room. This is how I know that I really did get up out of bed and was not dreaming because I had turned on the television. I don't know what I saw that morning but it was not mean or dangerous it just was there and appeared to afraid of little old me.

Dark Messenger,Australia,Apparitions / Voices / Touches,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Apparitions / Voices / Touches :: Dark Messenger

I 'm a registered nurse doing a lot of night shifts. One evening when I just finished my last night shift in a hospital out of town, I was resting on my couch in living room and knitting a jacket for my son. When I lifted my head up (as if I was feeling someone inside the room), I saw a black shadow of a young man coming through the door and came very close to me and went straight out of window. I was stunned what I saw, and of course scared.

I went out of the living room to call my husband, but my husband was gone out long before, I couldn't came back to the house, and sat outside on the balcony waiting for my husband. When my husband returned from outside, I told him about the ghost, he said a couple of night ago he also felt that someone was lurking around the room, although he couldn't see the ghost, he thought there were possums or nocturnal animals on the roof of the house.

Two weeks later a car crushed into the tree right in front of our house and the occupant and the driver were instantly killed in this car crush. I thought maybe the ghost was trying to tell us that something nasty was going to happen by lurking around the room.

The Crazy Ghost,"Kentucky, United States",Poltergeists / Physical Manifestations,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Poltergeists / Physical Manifestations :: The Crazy Ghost

O nce when I was home alone, I was going to sleep and I saw a shadow of someone dancing in my room, I turned to look back but I saw nothing but my window. About a week later I was startled by it again but this time it was a different story. I was in the kitchen with my mother and we both had to use the bathroom, and then when I came out, first I saw all the drawers open, all the cabinets were open too. When I rushed to tell my mother, we came back, everything was closed. No one in the house (for right now that is) could reach the top cabinet.

This all started happening every year... Then every month, every week now every day. I don't know how to stop it all. Once when we went camping in our woods (no bears there) we packed a full pack of beer. We all were tired, we had a busy say. I woke up at 3:15 because it was so cold, I'm not used to sleeping out of my home. I saw this see through guy with full black drinking our beer! I told him to go away then he disappeared... with the beer. I've tried talking to him but he runs off somewhere I'm really getting sick of him bothering me. I really think he's harmless but he's a real pain. He acts like a 5 year old child. He starts messing about in my room at night.

He is sitting there crying sometimes, but he looks at the age of 16.

Don't Mess with Ouija Boards,"Colorado, United States",Ouija Board / Seances,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Ouija Board / Seances :: Don't Mess with Ouija Boards

M y family bought a middle class home in Arvada Colorado in the mid 1970's. The house was normal and had no activity up until my sister and I became teenagers in the mid 1980's. That was about the time that my parents got a divorce and my sister and I got interested in Ouija boards.

One Summer night in 1985 we decided to invite some friends over to use the ouija board to find out if it was just a game or not. We figured the only way to get it to move was that one of us would be moving it. We really didn't believe that it would work. Well at first it didn't. We almost gave up and most of us had stood up and started to walk away when the pointer moved on its own. My sister's friend, being the only one left sitting by it, let out a loud scream and told all of us to come back and sit back down before it stopped. Well we started to get all types of answers after that.

The friend that was left sitting there started to ask really stupid questions trying to make it mad or something. The last question she asked was if he could prove he really existed would he rape her that night. Not really believing that it was all real. That night as she walked home from our house someone or something jumped out of the bushes and threw her down to the ground. He/It held her down and ripped her clothes off and raped her.

We woke up the next morning to the phone ringing tell us that she was in the hospital and had been beaten almost to death. The doctor had told her that they did a rape kit on her and found that she had been raped but they were not sure by what. There was no evidence left behind and it did not seem like a typical rape. They could not explain it. The only thing she ever told us about it was that it was a figure and she could not see a face or really a form.

After that we had strange occurrences in our house for everyday until we moved about 8 years later. For some reason though we have talked to the new neighbors and they have not had one experience there. Like it was only there because of our energy. That I have never been able to explain.

The Haunting at Riverside Park,"Wisconsin, United States",Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: The Haunting at Riverside Park

M y family moved to a house located 2 blocks from Riverside Park in Wausau, WI in 1989... The summer before I was to enter the second grade. Being that the park was close, the neighborhood kids and I spent most of our summer vacation there - playing tag, fishing, and bike riding. There is a bridge that connects the main park to another section called Ferns Island, obviously the name because that area is surrounded by water. The water, of course, is jet black... either polluted or evil. The kids refused to go to that section of the park because it's the most haunted.

The story went that hundreds of years ago, a witch inhabited the park area... There was a boy who was fishing in the area and fell in river then drowned. The townspeople blamed the witch and burnt her tiny hut. A bloody battle rose between the witch and the townspeople. Bodies of those townspeople were thrown in the river... Finally when the battle ended, the townspeople buried the dead and left that area... The witch disappeared but its spirit still roamed the park. (I never investigated the story to confirm it's originality.)

My cousins had an experience at Riverside once. One night the cousins were hanging out with friends in the parking lot, standing outside their cars and talking. The only source of light was the vehicle headlights. All the park lights were dead. Gang members once infested the park and the city just gave up on cleaning it up. The group heard slurping sounds and splashing water. They looked toward the river and saw a dark figure hunched over near the riverbank as if peeling and eating something. The figure turned around and a pair of red eyes looked stared back at them. As the figure walked closer, the group jumped into their cars and drove off, never looking back. They told this story to my father. The next morning my father went to investigate. He came back with a report that there were open crayfish shells and a decaying fish on the riverbank but nothing more.

The next story comes from my older brother - CK. CK worked the second shift and he got off work at midnight. Having such a work schedule, for weeks he hasn't seen his buddies. So during one of his breaks, he called his friends and set up a time to hang out that night after work. They choose Riverside to meet up since it was close to where the friends lived and his workplace.

After CK got off work, he drove pass IGA, a supermarket, where he saw his buddies in the parking lot loading beer to the back trunk of their car. CK waved to them, the guys waved back. CK went to Riverside to wait for the guys. He parked close to the riverbank, rolled down the driver's side window about an inch then pulled down his seat and laid down looking at the night sky in his car. All of a sudden he sees a woman with flowing blonde hair running past his car. She then came up to his window and tapped on it. CK got up and asked her what she wanted. At first CK thought the woman was a victim of rape because her clothes were ripped and her hair was distressed.

The woman was in hysterical mode and crying, she slid her fingers through the driver's window opening and told CK, ""Everyone's dying, you have to help me! An old witch is down there, she's killing everyone, she killed my family, it's so bloody down there."" She wiggled her fingers toward CK.

Thinking she's just another nut, CK quickly closed his window... The woman jumped back. CK then backed out of the parking lot. Just as he was doing so, his buddies drove in the parking lot and the woman walked in-between the vehicles just as they were passing each other. CK got out of his car and ran toward his friends. The woman was nowhere to be found. ""Did you see her? Tell me you saw her!"" CK shouted at his friends. ""Who?"" they asked... ""That woman, she ran right in between our cars just as you guys were coming in,"" CK said. ""We didn't see anyone..."" was the guys' response.

Then CK said, ""Man, what took you guys so long? You guys were just at IGA, it only takes 2 minutes to get here."" The guys looked at each other and said, ""What are you talking about? We were NEVER at IGA, we came from the East side. We had to go pick up some stuff at my house."" CK and the guys looked at each other and left home. They never, ever met up at Riverside again.

Sitting on Top of Me,"Washington, United States",Old Hags / Night Attacks / Sleep Paralysis,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Old Hags / Night Attacks / Sleep Paralysis :: Sitting on Top of Me

I always believed that ghost exists but I never wanted to see one. I was always afraid I would get so scared, I'd have a heart attack or something. This happened to me when I lived with my son's dad. My son was just born a couple months before this happened and we were under a lot of stress being young parents and all. We lived in a house that was separated into three, so there was another person living beside us and another one lived upstairs.

I didn't have a crib for my son yet so I let him sleep in the living room on the couch since that was the closest thing we had to a bed besides our bed. We put a baby monitor in the living room right by him so we could hear him cry from our room which happened to be the furthest one from the living room.

One night we woke up to him crying (or what we thought was him). I rushed into the living room (like I normally do every night) to find him fast asleep which was really odd because I had just heard a baby crying. I didn't think anything of it and returned to my room. The crying on the monitor had also stop. I went to lay down next to Bobby (my son's dad) when we heard crying again. He told me to go check on the baby while he stayed in the room to see where that cry was coming from. I checked the living room but my son was asleep and it was quiet. I went back to the room and we listened to the cry. It sounded like a mechanical baby because it kept crying and crying over again with the same tone of cry. It had that really sad cry then it just stopped.

We climbed back into bed trying to figure out what it could have been. Bobby thought it could've been someone with a mechanical baby standing outside the living room window trying to lure us out there or it could be a baby ghost spirit or maybe our monitor was intercepting with someonelse's. When he mentioned the ghost part my heart started pounding really fast and I started sweating. I was so scared thinking about it, I was so sure a ghost was just going to pop out in front of me or something but he told me not to be scared otherwise I will see the ghost.

After that I got my son a crib and put him in the other room across from us and never used that monitor again. A couple months later I had a scary dream and I tried to wake up from it by opening my eyes. I finally got my eyes opened and sat up. The room was dark but there was light coming from the kitchen and the door was open because Bobby liked to stay up late playing video games in the living room.

I got out of the bed and started walking towards it but my head was tilted to the side and I couldn't straighten it. It was like my neck was broken and I was walking around with my head sideways like a corpse. I got scared and realized I must have been dreaming. Then I tried opening my eyes again to wake up and it worked. I woke up and just like in my dream the door was open and the kitchen light was on. I ran into the living room and to make sure Bobby was there and told him what had happened.

The next morning I woke up to what looked like Bobby sitting on top of me. I couldn't move or speak. He just sat there looking down at me but I knew it wasn't Bobby because behind his eyes I saw nothing. It was like there was no soul behind it so I struggled and tried to move and finally I woke up. Again everything looked exactly like it had when I saw him.

During those experiences I was undergoing a lot of stress and I don't know if that's what triggered it, but I've never had an experience since that.

Old Grandma,"California, United States",Family / Friends Visits,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Family / Friends Visits :: Old Grandma

M y sisters and brother, my parents and I were in the kitchen watching television, it was about 10:30 pm at the time. Just the past week, my grandma had died from ""eating ice cream"" they said. She had suffered from stomach freeze instead of brain freeze. After the funeral on saturday, my family and I have been seeing strange things and hearing weird noises late at night. (Back to the day where my whole family was together watching TV).

My dad had told us all to go to bed because it was late. Usually every night my dad would shake his key chain to scare my little brother so he would go to sleep. But that night, it wasn't exactly what we thought it was. The first time was my dad shaking his key chain because us girls were talking and laughing. I was about 5 or 6 years old at the time! Me and my sisters were cracking up jokes and laughing and having fun.

First time my dad shook his keys, my little brother got scared and went to sleep right away! My mom and my sisters and my little brother and I slept on a mattress (King size) my dad slept on a single bed because he didn't want to be distracted! After me and my sister were done laughing and joking, and were getting tire and ready to sleep. Everyone had fallen asleep except me, I'm always the last one to fall asleep even today still.

I was just about to close my eyes and getting myself comfortable when I heard the keys jingling. My dad was asleep, I heard him snoring, but I asked him to stop shaking his keys because everyone was asleep already. But my dad gave a replied, ""I'm not shaking my keys..."" I thought he was joking and ask him again. But he gave me the same replied. I was frighten a little so I woke my older sister up, she told me she was asleep but she could still hear the keys jingling.

I finally fell asleep, and now my older sister was up. We sleep right below the window and it was open so it was cold. My older sister pulled the blanket over out feet, but then, all of a sudden the blanket when right up not covering our feet. I was REALLY scared now. Me and my sister again cover the blanket over feet again, this time the blanket didn't go up, instead someone was tickling our feet. We both thought it was our dad and asked him to stop. But he gave us a replied, ""I'm not tickling your feet, I'm sleeping all the way over here..."" Me and my sister were really, really scared. I mean scared to death!

I was too scared to get up and look around so I decided to go under the blankets and curl up. My older sister however, got up in a sitting position and looked around, she told me, she didn't see anything at first. But then when she was about to lay back down, she saw it. It was there at the end of the mattress. It was there smiling and waving at my sister. She was wearing hmong clothes, a traditional outfit for new year and also when they die. She had blood dripping on one side of her mouth and her teeth were red. My sister said, her hair was long and black and messy. Just when the ghost was about to the climb on the bed, my sister screamed very loud and woke EVERY one up. I was so scared that I cried, but I wasn't the only one. My younger sisters and my little brother had cried too. We all told my parents what we saw that night. My parents went to their house and ask grandpa to take a look, and he told us that grandma had came to visit because she misses us!

Dufferin Avenue,Canada,Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: Dufferin Avenue

I live in one of the oldest incorporated cities in canada, founded by loyalists. My City is not estranged from despair what with being a city upon the harbor that has seen many fatalities and lonely hearts waiting for the loves of their lives to return. My City has also been victim to a fire that has wiped out the entire portion of our uptown area. So it's no small wonder that 80% of the homes here are several 100 years old.

With that being said, it should come to no surprise that I have lived in many ""haunted"" houses. For as long as I can remember I've been hypersensitive to the paranormal. I've had psychics tell me I in my last life was a psychic who used my abilities selfishly so as she explained it, (remarkably correct I might add) my abilities in my past life were like a running tap, meaning I could use it whenever I wanted, and unfortunately in this life my tap only leaks every once in a while. I have dreams that turn into events or conversations weeks or years later, and I also feel emotions of certain energies around me.

When I was eight my family and I had moved into a duplex that was owned by a pair of rich 80 year old brothers as an escape from their wives, they'd call it. We rented the attic, the top floor, the workshop and the basement. We moved in february after a severe ice storm that put my city in pause, so feeling cold in that house only seemed normal. The first night I was setting up my books and toys in my new room when I heard my hangers in my closest move by themselves and stop as soon as I looked at them. I had hung a grocery bag on my door handle for junk and when I turned around to put trash in it the bag had been taken off the door knob and laid on the floor, ends tied. I didn't think much of it at the time, I never felt threatened.

Years passed in that house and I always saw flashes of light walk across my hallway, footsteps at night on the stairs and attic, my back door rattling when there was no wind and whispers. I felt several spirits in that house, one mainly in the washroom. I always felt the presence of an older woman who seemed very lonely and upset. When I would be in there, I would find my eyes tearing up in sadness for no apparent reason, even when I was the happiest I could be.

My little sister was born when I was twelve, I took another bedroom (for about a week) on my first night in that room that was seldom used. I felt a tingling sensation in my toes that coursed through my body almost feeling as though I was paralyzed. When I felt someone sit on my bed. I could feel that this presence was not that of the woman I always felt, she was comforting. This presence who I always assumed was named ray seemed not to be evil, but frustrated and a trickster. The cupboards in the kitchen would be open etc. But one day ray got angry. A friend of mine was with me in the kitchen, and was walking by my cats water dish, when from two feet away from her feet, the dish exploded with the force of it being thrown against the wall without ever being touched.

We had to move from that home when I was sixteen due to the death of the home owners, when my skeptical parents began to experience things. When packing up the attic my mother felt a hand press on her shoulder and no one was home, footsteps on the stairs and a goodbye whispered as she left. I never felt comfortable in that house especially in the attic, kitchen and the bedroom I stayed in that night...

But I did find out that there was an old lady who had lived in our home before us, who had died in the bathroom. And there was a ray that had also lived there as well. When we moved that day I thought that my ghost stories would end... I couldn't have been more wrong.

Gloustershire Cathedral,United Kingdom,Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: Gloustershire Cathedral

W e as a family decided, as many other families tend to do, to go on a family outing. Three generations decided on Gloustershire cathedral. Almost straight away wandering about the cloisters, three of us heard singing. Monk singing. At first we threw it off as practice but while in the cafe we were assured that no such practice was taking place that day.

We were joined later by our daughter and her baby son who was in a bit of a panic. She had seen blood. Again in the cloisters on one of the stone benches. So we went with her to put her mind at ease and see if anyone had had an accident. Well of course we arrived at the said bench, no blood. So we wandered up the cloisters again. Again we all heard the singing and then we saw the blood appear from on a stone bench, a pool as fresh as you like. What was bizarre was that it was dripping from an over head gargoyle. Scary stuff. Bewildered we carried on our visit with no acceptable conclusion.

Same day we visited Littledene hall in Gloustershire, well reputed for its ghosts, we were unprepared for what we were about to experience. First the babies all of a year old became very upset in the room that is said to be poltergeist. A light appeared from behind the wooden wall paneling that was very disturbing. The grandmother could not take the eerie air and went outside to the fishponds with the two small children.

The father and the daughter investigated the bedroom which I think was the red bedroom. Nothing untoward to start, until the father decided to poke his nose in a cupboard built into the wood wall paneling, after finding several books, footsteps could be heard behind both of them. And then a feeling of being on board a rocking boat. Both lost their balance and left the room sick.

A few weeks later the house changed hands. And the family could not go back and relive the experience. We as a family would be ever so grateful if anyone else had similar experiences in these two locations?

The Man Who Was Not There,United Kingdom,Apparitions / Voices / Touches,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Apparitions / Voices / Touches :: The Man Who Was Not There

I was at work at an RAF camp during the summer, my office door was left open to allow the air to circulate due to it being stuffy because it was a hot day. I glanced up just in time to see a very smart Naval officer pass my door and go towards the office across the corridor... It could only have been this office because after that there was a brick wall and a dead end. He gave me the most dazzling smile which made my heart quicken up. He was about 25yrs old and very handsome. I didn't see him leave, so after about 15 minutes I went in to the other office and asked the clerk working there who this man was. She said there had not been anyone but her in the office all morning!

I cannot explain this, he looked as solid as anyone else, no different from anyone else, yet the clerk said she had seen no-one enter or leave the office. I knew that the HQ building was supposed to be haunted, but not by a Naval officer, by an RAF officer, and I had not believed it until that day.

I do believe that there is something after death, but what I am not sure. I firmly believe that we all have a spirit and that if we deliberately set out to harm someone then we will harm our own spirit. I think that given the right circumstances things happen that cannot be explained, so many people have seen things that this cannot be dismissed as bunk. When there is tragedy people seem to be able to project themselves, this was demonstrated in WWII when mothers saw their sons and yet they were thousands of miles apart.

My Cousin and the Ouija Board,"Nebraska, United States",Ouija Board / Seances,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Ouija Board / Seances :: My Cousin and the Ouija Board

A ny of you who have read my comments to others can tell I am absolutely against Ouija boards. I had not posted this story yet because, well, it has taken me some time to put it into words. My husband who is a staunch un-believer in spirits and entities (although he feels UFO's are a possibility - go figure) even had experiences with this and tightens up when ever this event is brought up by anyone.

This happened about 3 years ago. My teenage son was having a sleep over with my cousin's son pretty close to the same age. They spent a lot of time together, along with 2 other boys their age. They never were trouble makers or anything, just liked to get together at one of the houses on non-school nights, stay up and watch movies and play video games.

My cousin called me at home at about 9:30 PM just frantic. I could hardly understand what she was saying. I did make put that she wanted me to come over immediately and I could hear all the boys in the back ground talking and being loud, as if they were stressed or excited. It was -8 degrees Fahrenheit so needless to say I wasn't looking forward to leaving the house but she just kept shouting that I needed to get over there.

I bundled up quickly and headed over to their house. It was only about a 5 minute drive, so my car didn't even really have a chance to warm up at all. As I pulled up into the duplex, I noticed my sister's car, 2 other cousins' cars and the people renting the opposite side of the duplex were all outside. I thought ""Oh, no. A fire! Oh hope no one was hurt!""

I jumped out of the truck and bounded up the stairs. My cousin kept saying it is down there, it is down there - all the while pointing to the basement stairs. I asked what was down they and she wouldn't answer. She was white as a sheet.

I had the boys lead me downstairs and explain what was going on. The boys indicated that they had just put a rocking chair in the room and while they were playing video games they kept hearing whispering. Thinking it was each other they let it go on for a while. Finally, one of the boys got disgusted because it was interrupting their concentration. He turned around to hush the other boys and saw a figure in the rocking chair. The figure was dark but had a red tinged glow around the chair. My nephew let out a gasp and all of the boys turned around... Here sat this thing with the area of his face directed at the group of boys. As the boys were focused on the being in the chair, it leaned forward and hissed ""GET OUT"". The boys jumped up as fast as they could to get out there. As the boys left the being jumped out of the chair and hovered about an inch from the ceiling.

When the boys returned to my cousin, she went down stairs and experienced the same Entity. As she got down into the basement, the thing jumped out at her and hissed ""GET OUT"". She was up the stairs so fast she said her feet did not touch the stairs.

A family friend came over and brought an Ouija board. Up until this point, I had never used one and didn't know much about them. The only thing I though was that they were a bunch of hog wash. We all went into the basement (except the boys, they wanted nothing to do with the basement at all) and began using the Ouija board. We asked if we were alone, it said no. We asked if the spirit wanted to communicate with us, it said no. We asked what the spirit wanted from us and it very plainly spelled out ""DIE"", then the pointer began spinning. We were all up the stairs in a flash. I was the last one up. I turned and looked down the stairs and near the rocker I could se a shadow of human shape hunched way over with greenish pointed teeth and orange eyes. It began to move towards the stairs and I took the last four steps in one leap. I screamed down the stairs, ""you are not welcome in this house, in the name of God and all that is Holy, go back to where you came from. If you can not return, you must not in the name of God pass this door!""

It was 2:00 AM at this time. My cousin and her family came and slept on the hide a bed and air mattresses at my house. We left the basement door firmly locked when we left.

Next morning, we went to my cousin's church and consulted a priest. He said he would meet us at the house in and hour. We feed the kids, took all the kids back to my house, picked up our husbands and headed to her house. We did not enter until the priest arrived, although my husband thought this ridiculous.

When we entered the house, the Ouija board that we had left locked in the basement was in the middle of the living room floor with the pointer dead center in the middle of it. The basement door which we had firmly latched was wide open as were several of the drawers and doors in the kitchen. The television was on and the bathroom shower was on. The priest tried to make light of the situation with some levity, he said ""well at least it is a clean evil, it took a shower."" None of us laughed.

My cousin and I went outside. I am not sure if there was an exorcism or what, my husband stayed in the house with the priest as did her husband. They were in there for about 1/2 hour. They then went to the back of the house, placed the Ouija board, pointer and box to the board in a metal trash can and burned it. After burning it, the priest sprinkled holy water over the ashes which continued to hiss and sputter (I don't think that was all from the heat). The priest said he did what he could but now might be a good time to relocate and find a different house. My cousins moved two days later, actually spending the nights at my house. The basement door had deep gashes in it both inside and out from top to bottom. As they were moving into the new house, the rocking chair had been placed in the garage until they could figure out where they wanted it. I was walking by the garage and looked over at the chair and saw a man, tall and lean, wearing a faded red t-shirt, black ball cap and jeans sitting there rocking. I assumed it was one of my cousin's friends who had come to help move taking a break. When I went back in the house, I asked my cousin who he was. She said that no one else had come to help move except for family.

They gave that chair away to her sister who thought this was all a hoax. On the 3rd day she had the chair, she walked by her sitting room and saw a young man described exactly as I had seen rocking in the chair. The chair was burned that night in the metal can. Some holy water the priest had left sprinkled on top just for good measure. Again, hissing and sputtering.

All my husband will tell me about being in that house with the priest is there where actions and sounds coming from everywhere and you couldn't pin point a location because it would move. He stated there was something ""not human"" in there in it was none to happy to be interrupted. I asked if it left. He said he wasn't sure but wasn't in a hurry to go back and find out. He will not talk about it any more.

The Night Before my Exam,India,Misc,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Misc :: The Night Before my Exam

I am a resident of a city called Kolkata in the state of West Bengal in India. This is the strangest fact I have ever come across about my house. A fairly new house built on a marshland, this house was about 7 years old. My dad and myself literally stood and watched the house being built. There were no strange things going on. I had spent numerous nights alone in that house watching TV or sometimes even drinking beer. I am a pretty normal guy with pretty normal habits.

The night I am speaking about is 8th June, 2004 - the night before my Programming Language (Visual C++) paper for my 2nd semester in college. I have always studied in a group after joining college and since my house was the largest, my friends used to come, stay and study at my house. That night there were 5 of us -- Saurav, Arnab Das, Arijit, Joydeep and myself. Starting at 12 am, we continued well until 2:30 am.

It was then when everything started going wrong. We heard a dog suddenly howl. It, being summer here at that time, was not normal for the dog to howl because of cold or hunger because it gets plenty around our areas. The eeriest thing about this howl was it started from one end of the street and went on to the other, and, let me remind you, this howl came from only one dog. We went outside to check and felt a cold wind blow just around us. Somehow, I was convinced that beyond us, the weather was fairly warm, only the immediate surrounding was unusually cold. We went inside and start studying again, the doors and windows kept open.

Suddenly, Arnab Das, in the middle of studying, looked up outside the window right behind me and kept staring outside blankly. It was as if someone was standing there and scaring the shiat out of Arnab (excuse my language). His eyes were turning pale and we could feel that something was going wrong. I repeatedly talked to him wanting to know what happened and all he did was stare.

A few seconds later he fell down as if someone pushed him and closed his eyes. When he opened them again, believe me, I would have been scared to death seeing those eyes. They did not have eyeballs, they were pale yellow with red nerves all over the pupil. His body was cold and he was shivering. We did not understand what to do and tried calling my mom and dad, but it was as if someone had cut us out from the entire world. We were screaming but in vain.

I was seated next to Arnab with my back to an iron almirah. Usually hot air comes out when you breathe, however, when arnab let out a nasty, long breath, it passed my left hand and my hand was freezing. When I looked to my right, between where I had hung 3 of my suits, I could see a figure of a middle aged lady with long hair. It was so pale that I could not make her face out. She circled around all of us but neither did she harm us nor did she communicate with us. Also, a very strange fact is, there was a mosquito coil which was burning, it went out as if someone threw water on it. None of us moved as you can understand, so it was strange.

Now, after some time, I do not know how much, this lady seemed to fade out of my room, out the window beside my bed. To my astonishment, now it seemed that something or being was encircling our entire house and that cold air was out of our room but we could feel that the air was surrounding our house. I tried to fight the feeling as we had to study for our exam. Pretending to be brave enough to get up, I did so and went to my computer.

A computer cannot go to the BIOS screen unless you press a button. My computer started up and went straight to the BIOS, showed me a demon as a background, the monitor flickered twice and it shut itself off. I am a tech myself so I knew this was not normal failures, tried the same thrice with the same result. The fourth time, it came back on normally with my normal desktop background. Well, we were terrified throughout the night and I personally shut all the doors and windows although all of us were certain that the thing was right there outside, maybe, waiting for us to open the windows again.

Gradually time passed on and it was 5:30 was the first ray of sunlight shone up in my room through the window. This gave us another strange shock. Remember I told you that the mosquito coil went out. The moment the sun rays reached the coil, it started burning again.

We have shifted from that house now and until date I have not come across anything strange or supernatural... Trust me guys... I was scared to almost death... I did not get an explanation of what happened neither did my friends... Can you tell me what went wrong?

A few months ago, I was about to take a shower. I needed another bar of soap, so I went and grabbed a new bar out of the drawer. I pulled it out of the box and set it on a shelf in the shower. A little while after I had been in the shower, I reached up to grab the soap. When I pulled it down from the shelf, I realized that was not in the shape it had originally been in. The more I examined it, I realized it looked like a large hand had grabbed the new bar and squeezed it really hard. It was totally smashed. I freaked out and started crying. I called my husband and told him what had happened. He laughed it off, until he got home and looked at it. The hand print was even bigger than his! So I threw the soap out.

I tried forgetting about the soap. A couple days later, I was in the shower and I had the radio in the bathroom with me. I had the volume turned up loud, so I could hear it while I showered. My phone rang, so I reached out and grabbed my cell phone. Right before I answered it, my radio turned itself all the way down!

A few months passed without anything else happening. Then one night, I was in the kitchen fixing dinner. I put dinner in the oven and set the timer for about an hour. I walked away and got on the computer while I was waiting. An hour or so later, the timer goes off. I walk back in the kitchen and open the oven to find that it has been shut off! I know for a fact that I did NOT touch it after I turned it on! There was nobody else in the house with me! How did the dial for the oven turn off all by itself!?

Most recently, it was about 7:00 AM, I was laying in bed not wanting to get up. Every time my alarm would go off, I would hit snooze and just lay there. After about an hour of that, it was getting late and I still needed to get ready for work. I knew that if I laid in bed any longer, I would end up being late. I closed my eyes for a minute. All of a sudden, I heard the voice of my uncle and felt someone smack my forehead. My eyes popped open to see that nobody was there. The crazy part is, my uncle has been dead for 10 years!

Ghost Girl Following,Sweden,Apparitions / Voices / Touches,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Apparitions / Voices / Touches :: Ghost Girl Following

I n the past vacations, I and my family went to Stockholm to visit my uncles and cousins. I stayed in the outskirts of Stockholm in my aunt's house. One day we went on a field trip into the centre of Sweden. On the way we saw a 15-year-old girl that had a bad leg, so my mother told her if she wanted a ride until the village we were going to. She said ok.

We then passed by an old cemetery and when we turned backwards to see the girl, she was gone. We could not understand what was happening because there was no sound of the door opening or closing and we were going at 180 kilometers per hour and my mother and I hurried to the village.

When we arrived at the village I felt hungry and told my mother if we could eat in a traditional Swedish restaurant and we did. While we were eating, I looked forward, and saw a girl. She seemed a lot like the girl we found on the road but I thought: ""No, it can't be that girl"". We paid the woman in the restaurant for the food and took a walk in the countryside.

There, we were walking and we could not stop thinking about the girl. I then sensed that someone was following me and my mother, so I looked around and there was nothing. This was really weird and scary. It was I think 6 pm and we decided to return to the city.

In the way back I still felt that someone was following us. So I told my mom to hurry up because it was getting dark and we were told by the townspeople that the road is not so secure at night.

We were on the road back to Stockholm and I took a glance on the mirror and saw the girl who we took that day before. I blinked and she was not there. I thought I was getting crazy or I was imagining things.

When we arrived at home my aunt said that her best friend's daughter had died in the morning this day in a camp she was with her friends near the spot we took the girl. She said we had to go to the funeral and something very strange happened. We saw the coffin and a photo was placed on top of it. I called my mother so she could see the picture and we both realized that the girl that was in that coffin was the same girl we both picked up on the road that day in the morning.

I really don't understand this thing and I think about it all the time. It is very strange what happened that day! I hope someone can explain this to me.

It Wasn't the Dog,"Texas, United States",Pets / Animals,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Pets / Animals :: It Wasn't the Dog

W hen I was about twelve maybe thirteen years old, I was sitting in my mother's room watching her television lounging. My mother's room has a bathroom adjacent and the door was closed tightly. I started hearing something pounding on the bathroom door like a dog might if trapped. We had two inside dogs and one outside dog at the time so I thought that Bogie, my border collie, had somehow trapped herself in there and was trying to get out.

The pounding on the door was very loud and scared me very badly because I thought that I was alone in the room. I couldn't remember either of the inside dogs coming into the room to be with me. I figured that one of them went to sleep in the bathroom prior to the door being closed and had woke up and wanted out.

I got up to let the dog out of the bathroom because I didn't want her/him to be freaking out locked in there having a puppy coronary. It was very cold near that door, which was very odd considering I live in Texas and it is hotter than dog snot on most days. As I approached the door Bogie (my dog) walked into the room and stopped right next to me at my feet looking at the bathroom door and growling. Realizing that there could not have been anyone else in the bathroom, the dog and I ran like hell into the kitchen where everybody else in the household was helping prepare dinner at the time (I know I was being lazy).

My mother asked me why I had been banging on the door, which means she heard the noise. I told her that I had not and what had happened but she blamed my over active imagination and believed that I was trying to scare my younger brothers, who were looking at me like I had lost my mind. It should be noted that the other inside dog was sitting at my younger brother's feet begging for spaghetti and our outside dog was outside enjoying the warm Texas sunshine. I will admit to nothing but I did enjoy scaring my kid brothers once in awhile.

However this time I had not been trying to scare anyone least of all myself. I still wonder what would have happened if I opened that door because I got a angry vibe from whatever it was on the other side. It wasn't like the green mass with a face that I saw when I was 5 or 6, see Saturday morning cartoons for that story.

There's Always Something Going On,"Alaska, United States",Misc,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Misc :: There's Always Something Going On

H ello again, dear friends. I regret that it has been so long since I have submitted anything to you, but life gets in the way you know? I've decided to put together a collection of what happened while I've been away from you all. So, here it is.

This first one has been happening for a while. Every night, when I get home, I would see this creature at the side of my house, half hidden in shadow. I say creature because it wasn't humanlike, more animalistic. It could have been a bear, but I kept trying to get a closer look and it would either just disappear or run away and vanish. Well, a good friend of mine told me to get a flashlight and see if it was transparent or solid.

I did and the light went through the thing, but it didn't illuminate its shape at all, I just saw the light on my neighbors house behind it. It just disappeared right in front of me. Then my friend posed a theory. I recalled this dog who lived down the street from my house. I only saw him once and that was when I returned him to his home after he ran away. I pet him and took him home only to see his owner beat him with a shovel. I felt bad for the dog, whose name was Maximus, but there wasn't anything I could do since I had no proof of the abuse.

Maximus was never seen again and a new puppy showed up outside the house. I assumed that he's run away again but now I think he's dead and his spirit is haunting me. My buddy thinks that it could be because I was nice to him and he wants to make sure I'm safe.

The next incident, I'm not entirely sure is supernatural in nature, so I'll just let you decide. I was in the shower, and I'd just gotten over a fever, so I was pretty tired... well, I felt like I was being pushed to sleep, but I resisted. I looked down and saw blood in the water. Curious as to where it was coming from, I bent down and then it started going down my leg. I lifted my hand and saw a huge, gaping wound on my wrist! There was so much blood slowly oozing out that it was black in color. In a sort of shock, I lifted my other hand and saw and identical wound. I freaked, screamed, cried, and grabbed a towel that I pressed between my wrists as hard as I could to stop the bleeding. I sat in the tub and wept.

Then I woke up sitting in the tub with the shower running still. I had the towel pressed between my wrists and there was fresh blood on the towel, but there wasn't any evidence of the wounds on my wrists! Any ideas as to what may have caused this? Supernatural or not? Guess that's for you to decide.

The final thing happened last night around eleven. I heard my name being whispered angrily and then I sat up and was slapped across the face. Not too pleasant. But that's all that's happened. I hope you read and have any insights.

Kangaroo... in Texas?,"Texas, United States",Pets / Animals,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Pets / Animals :: Kangaroo... in Texas?

W hen my brothers were about 10 years old and 8 years old respectively they had been playing in my mother's room in a large cardboard box that they had turned into a fort. We were the kind of kids that could turn sofa cushions, bed sheets and a cardboard boxes into a mission control station worthy of nasa. This drove our mother crazy but our father thought it was cute so we got away with this on a regular basis.

That evening the hallway light had been turned off to ""save"" electricity, which is something my mother was famous for doing (and still does). My brothers were joking around and playing at being astronauts when suddenly I heard them both scream and duck for cover knocking over several things.

Being twelve whole years old I considered myself far too mature and sophisticated to play fort with my infant brothers so I had been reading in my bedroom on the other side of the hallway. I came into the room all authoritarian and asked them what was wrong and they said that they saw a ""kangaroo"" jumping down the hallway. I told them to stop playing around but they continued saying that they saw ""a kangaroo"" jumping down the hall looking like a shadow but definitely not a human shadow. I asked them it if could have been either of our dogs but they told me the ""kangaroo"" had been standing on its rear legs jumping down the hallway pausing once to ""look at them"" (How a shadow looks at you I don't know) and then continuing towards my room.

I never saw what they saw but they were adamant and refused to leave the hall light off ever again.

Yogurt Trip Gone Bad,"Texas, United States",Poltergeists / Physical Manifestations,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Poltergeists / Physical Manifestations :: Yogurt Trip Gone Bad

O ur house growing up was not necessarily haunted but my family members were always having strange experiences from time to time that lead us to wonder if we were a little more perceptive than the average joe as far as the supernatural. We were the only family who lived in the house we grew up in so there were no residual entities that I knew about. Leading me to believe that we are just prone to experience things outside of the normal.

When my youngest brother was about 7 years old he had walked into the kitchen to get a yogurt snack. I remember the yogurt snacks because they were those pricey yogurts in a plastic package that you could squeeze out and eat without a spoon. My younger brother was gone a few minutes and we thought nothing of this because he probably got side tracked. Suddenly he was running back in utter terror into the back bedroom where my other brother and myself were sitting and screamed that the cabinet doors had been slamming open and shut while he was in the kitchen.

My brother and myself had heard something slam repeatedly while my younger brother was out of the room but being that he was about 7 years old we just assumed he dropped something or couldn't find was he was looking for.

My brother and me were not afraid of much except our parents arguing (they divorced shortly thereafter) and decided to check out the kitchen. Of course we took our baseball bats and guard dog Bogie because you have to go armed into dangerous situation. Looking back on this I guess the extra emotional atmosphere probably added strength to whatever it was that wanted our attention. This was in the middle of the day and it was bright outside (not scary) so we went back into the kitchen and could find nothing out of place.

My little brother swears he saw those cabinets open and close but with no evidence we couldn't prove anything other than of course that he was a dork.

The White Lady Moved in With Us,Philippines,Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: The White Lady Moved in With Us

W hen I was in college, my parents decided to move to a new house in Quezon City. The house my parents wanted to move in was a townhouse located inside a compound. The house looked decent enough to live in, but when I first saw it, I couldn't help but feel that there was something wrong with it.

When we moved in, I was able to speak with one of the old tenants in the compound, I asked him if there was anything strange going on in the area. The man mentioned that a lot of people have seen a white lady walking around the compound late at night. Nobody knows when she started appearing but as far as anyone can remember, she has always been spotted there.

I spent a few nights waiting outside our house wanting to see if this was true, but nothing happened, I asked my neighbor if the stories were true, all he could tell me was that there hasn't been a sighting for weeks, nobody sees her anymore. Eventually I forgot about the stories.

A few months later, strange things started to happen inside our house. Water faucets would turn off by themselves, lights would either turn on or off and the dogs would often jump around as if playing with an invisible friend. One time my mom got so angry with me for coming home late that stormed inside my room and started reprimanding me. As my mom was lecturing me about being responsible and stuff, the TV and the radio suddenly turned on and started switching channels rapidly. My mom just gave me a weird look and left my room immediately.

One evening a friend of mine went over to visit, since I always come home late, my mom allowed him to go wait for me inside my room. While he was laying in my bed browsing through one of my books, he saw the distinct figure of a woman sitting inside one of my large cabinets staring at him. My friend ran out of the house without saying goodbye to my parents. He only told me about the incident two days later when I invited him for a sleep over.

The ghost never really bothered us that much so we just let her be. Needless to say, every visitor that we had only came by once. None of them wanted to return to the house after spending time there. A lot of them told us that they would often hear a woman whispering in their ears, but they couldn't understand what the voice was saying.

When It came time for us to move to a different place, the house, which was usually pleasant, gave off an air of sadness. During our last night in the house, I was putting my things into some boxes when I felt a gust of cold air brush beside me, when I looked at the door, I saw a pretty young woman smiling at me. She disappeared as soon as she came. I smiled and thought that maybe she just wanted to say goodbye.

Last I heard she was walking the compound grounds again. She may be waiting for another family to move in with again.

Playful Ghosts Making Me Laugh,Cyprus,,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Playful Ghosts Making Me Laugh

W hen I was about 12-13 years old, my family and I moved to a nice apartment. It was summer time when we moved and we had no air conditioning so me, my brother and my father would sleep in the living room, on the floor in front of the balcony door because it was so much cooler there. It must have been around 1am when I woke up to the sound of pans and pots being smashed and hit, at first I thought it might have been my mother doing an after midnight wash up, she does that kind of stuff, she has a thing for cleanliness and tidiness, if she goes to bed without doing the dishes she'll feel guilty!

I got up and stood in front of the kitchen door and although the kitchen light was off, I lived on a main street so the lights from the road made the kitchen bright! My mother wasn't there, I turned on the light and I saw a pan shaking and moving on our stove, it kept rattling and making a terrible noise so I went over there and grabbed it, and that's when I thought I heard laughter and without realizing I started smiling and laughing! I don't know why, I mean that is NOT a normal reaction, I turned off the lights and went back to sleep, meanwhile my brother and father had not heard a thing.

After just a few moments the rattling started again, I followed the same procedure, only this time, when I grabbed the pan, the tap was turned on by itself and the water was running! I let go of the pan and run straight to the tap, things calmed and I went back to sleep, and then I hear the tap again, and laughter! I went to the kitchen and felt a presence there, but a very very happy one, so happy that I couldn't stop smiling, I think that night I fell asleep with a smile, but I still can't explain why!

I experienced a lot of things in that house, but that was the best! The rest were quite scary and freaky. I'll write about them soon.

The Ghostly Patient in a Private Hospital,Puerto Rico,Apparitions / Voices / Touches,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Apparitions / Voices / Touches :: The Ghostly Patient in a Private Hospital

M y story took place in Puerto Rico in 2003. I was just done with Nursing School and had just started my first nursing job in a Orthopedic Unit in a very upscale private hospital. I was with my preceptor (I was almost done with my orientation) and she told me to take her pt assignment and go and check each one alone. (For those of you who do not know the term ""pt assignment"" refers to the pts you have to take care of during a particular shift) I was really excited to this on my own and I started to check them by room number (eg. 154 then 155 and so on).

When I get to room 160 the door was opened and the lights were on (all of them), I looked to see inside the room and I saw a man laying in the bed cover with a blanket then I looked at the pt assignment and that room appeared to be empty. At this point I looked at the room number to checked if I was standing at the wrong room but no it was clearly room 160, having checked this I looked inside (again) and saw the same guy in the exact same way and I even looked to the window and I saw his reflection. At that moment my thought was: ""The nurse forgot to tell us about this guy"".

After this I finished the round (checking the pts) and went to my preceptor and told her: ""We have a pt in room 160 and is not on our assignment"". After I said that the nurse's eyes went wide open she then checked the census and asked me: ""Are you sure"" she went and grabbed the other RN and told her: ""Sara saw a pt in room 160 and I am sure we have nobody there"" The other nurse looked as surprised as she did, but after a few minutes they decided to go and check it out, before that, they asked me how was that guy (in appearance) and I told her what I saw: an older guy, white, in his 50's, bald with some white hair cover with a blanked in bed and seems to be asleep. They went really quick and looked then when they got back they asked again: ""are you sure it was in room 160? And I said yes!

By now I was pretty upset about all the asking about the room number then my preceptor told me that 1 week before a pt committed suicide in that room, and that the pt was a white male in his 50's, bald with white hair. I was in shocked and thought they we joking but not she then called security and asked them to check the room out, they came, saw nothing and closed the room, we did not go near that room for the rest of the shift.

"The I-5 Killer, The Gallegos, Ng & Lake","California, United States",Ghost Hunting,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Ghost Hunting :: The I-5 Killer, The Gallegos, Ng & Lake

S ince I have been writing ghost stories and leaving my infamous paranormal cellular phone number on my articles. I get some surprising calls. I received one call and I would consider it to be normal. A young lady named Jenny Swarts (Cohn) explained to me that she is a Numerologist and that she has a couple of ghost stories that she would like to share with me, if I could meet her at Border's Books. First off, Jenny was excited to take my birthdate and analyze my numbers. When I told her my birthdate, she told me that my number is 2911. 11 means I have high positive energy. 2 is my cooperation and balance. She says that I don't over cooperate and I don't under cooperate. She went on to say, that if I am pushed and it doesn't agree with me, I can become very uncooperative. Hmmm...me? 9 was universal, which included integrity and wisdom. After she read a few of my ghost stories, she said with an 11, she can understand why I have this high energy and passion to write ghost stories, that I have become prolific with my writings. She told me I have well-defined boundaries. She explained to me that she is a follower of Eastern philosophies, such as Hinduism, Tao and Buddhism. I told her about my author friend, David Allen Hulse who wrote the book Eastern Mysteries, that Carlos Santana retreated to an island to read and how Neil Gaiman used some of Hulse's ideas for his Sandman comic book series. After Jenny explained to me about my number 2911, we talked about her. She related a very personal ghost story, that I cannot disclose in this article. She felt compelled to share this heartwarming ghost story with me, I listened attentively. Then she told me another ghost story about a time when she was in Ashland, Oregon. She was walking into the field late at night and noticed these strange bluish purple lights in the field. As she watched the lights, she noticed that they were in the shape of small animals like squirrels and rabbits. She came to realize that she was actually watching the ghostly spirits of animals! Now here is the clincher, she wanted me to remember this. She told me that she had a vivid vision, she saw Pope Benedict XVI assassinated in front of a crowd of people, with his arms raised! I was somewhat stunned, because if this Pope is assassinated and the next Pope takes on the name of 'Peter', this would be the last Pope in the long succession of popes. This would be known as the 'end of times', which would harbor close to the Mayan prophesy of the Age of the Jaguar, the fifth and final sun for the final days, which will land on December 21, 2012! Jenny looked at me with sincerity and said...""Paul, please remember what I am telling you, I saw the Pope assassinated in my vision!""

I drove away a bit shakened. If her prophesy is correct, you heard it first in this article. When you delve into the paranormal, you meet all types of people that touch the boundaries of the paranormal and Jenny is one of those people. I hope her prediction is incorrect. We will have to wait and see. I needed to get home and contact some of my core group members, who have been doing some research for me. The research may lead us into another paranormal investigation. An investigation of ghoulish proportions.

I checked in first with Chris Grissom, Paranormal Investigator. I wanted to see what Chris dug up on serial killers Charles Chi-Tat Ng and Leonard Lake. Chris relates to me that Leonard Lake was a survivalist, that his ranch was located at Wilseyville in Calaveras County. Charles Ng and Leonard Lake were responsible for 25 murders, possibly more. Leonard had the idea of 'Operation Miranda', the gathering of sex slaves in his bunker. The bunker according to Chris was created to survive a nuclear holocaust. Leonard believed that collecting sex slaves, he and Charles could repopulate the world. Charles and Leonard took the collecting of sex slaves into a whole other dimension, they started video taping their bound victims during the rape, torture and murder of each victim. Leonard when cornered by lawmen, took his own life with a cyanide pill. Charles went up to Canada and killed 8 more people. When law enforcement extradited him back to the US, he bragged to inmates that he once killed a Marine during his time in the Corp. Charles remains in prison.

Next on the team, I contacted was Jennifer Baca, Paranormal Investigator. Her assignment was to get information on Gerald and Charlene Williams Gallego. Jennifer discovered the Gerald attended Sacramento High School. Charlene appeared to have a sweet and pleasant personality and she would approach young women and ask them if they would like to make money delivering leaflets. As the young girls approached the van that her husband Gerald was in, they were kidnapped and thrown into the van. While Charlene drove, her husband Gerald would rape, torture and murder the girls in the van. One of the places Charlene lured a girl to the van was at Sunrise Mall in Citrus Heights. Orb activity at Sunrise Mall was detected with the use of a digital camera on March 14, 2007 at 2:00 a.m. By Raquel Nunez, amateur paranormal investigator, with no affiliations. This does not indicate that the orb activity is related to the Gallegos murder, nor does it mean it's paranormal activity. But, it's something that can be looked into. I will explain later in this article, how I obtained this orb activity information...yes, keep reading.

Michele Stump, Researcher and Paranormal Investigator related a slew of information in regard to all of the serial murderers mentioned in the beginning of this article and others I have never even heard of. Michele is a crime buff and has read countless books on various killers throughout the history of mankind. She is a wealth of information when it comes to the crimes of murder. Michele discusses Randall Brent Woodfield aka I-5 Killer or I-5 Bandit. She tells me that Randall committed about 13 murders along the I-5 corridor stretching from Washington to California. What is interesting, according to Michele is the fact that if Randall wasn't a serial killer, he may have been a successful football player, because he was once drafted into the Green Bay Packers. He was extremely handsome and once posed for Playgirl Magazine.

Now here is when things get even more interesting. Like I said before, since I do write numerous ghost stories, I get contacted by a variety of people that have interests in the paranormal. Enter: Joseph Anthony Soyo. In one of my articles, I talk about the I-5 Killer, Charles Ng and Gallego and that we might do a possible investigation into this matter. Here is what Joseph emailed me. (Editing of his email done by me).

""Hi Paul. My name is Joseph Anthony Soyo, you can call me 'Joe'. I love the paranormal. I have been interested since the age of 14. I enjoyed reading your ------- House article. I'm going to have to check that out! I noticed you mentioned you might do an investigation on Charles Ng, I-5 Killer and Gallego. Here is something I know, that I would like to relate to you. My friend Raquel Nunez took some cool orb shots at Sunrise Mall, I believe Gallego killed one of his victims there. (I later get the date and facts about Raquel's orb shots). If you ever go to Humbolt Sink, this is where Gerald and his wife took two girls into an isolated area, hit them over the head with a shovel and buried them. I have got some very cool orb shots over there and have heard from locales that there is some residual haunting activity in this area. They said the I-5 Killer took one of his victims and killed her at Sutterville and I-5 near the Sacramento River embankment. If you go there late at night, you are definitely going to get some cool orb shots! I once got a misty white shot near a tree, the place is spooky as all hell! I'm pretty sure, that the I-5 Killer's victim is haunting this area! As for residual haunting activity at Lake's Ranch, if you can locate this place, I wouldn't mind checking it out, that place has got to be haunted! How many did he kill, like 35? Paul, keep on writing dude, maybe I will show you some magic tricks, Criss Angel is my idol and I am a pretty good magician. So, I have been told. Talk to you later. Joe""

It now appears that HPI is closing in towards areas that can truly be investigated. Stay tuned, to see what HPI discovers in the near future at the locations Joe mentioned. Thank you Joe, for your enlightening information! This really helps!

The Hitchhiker,"Wisconsin, United States",Apparitions / Voices / Touches,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Apparitions / Voices / Touches :: The Hitchhiker

M y cousin, his wife, and 3 kids were on their way from Wisconsin to Arkansas. He was moving there to start a chicken farm with our uncle. That evening before they left, our families got together and had dinner at the local Chinese restaurant. My cousin got a fortune cookie that interpreted something involving having a long journey but will end up at the same place... On the back of the slip it teaches one how to say the word ""chicken"" in Chinese... My cousin interpreted that to be a good omen for their trip because he was going to be starting a chicken farm.

The drive was going to be about 10-12 hours and having 3 kids, they left at 11 pm so the kids will be asleep the entire way and not be so antsy. Several hours later, my cousin stopped at a gas station to use the restroom. He left his three kids in the back seat; his wife was dozing off in the passenger seat. This was out in the boonies, the time was about 5-6am and the sun was just rising. My cousin got back in the car and drove for about 5 minutes. He suddenly felt the hair in back of his neck standing.

He looked at the rearview mirror to check on his kids when he saw a figure of a person with perm hair sitting in the backseat with his kids. He then turned around to see who it was and the figure disappeared. Within seconds his wife woke up. She told him that she had the strangest dream. The dream: They stopped at the gas station; there was a woman who wanted to go with them to Arkansas because her husband accidentally left her... she's alone and doesn't speak English. My sister in law told her (in the dream) that they were in a hurry to get to their uncle's place and they had three kids in the backseat, there wouldn't be any room. The woman got in the car - in the backseat with the kids but my sister in law dragged her out of the car and they left... Then she woke up. That was precisely the time my cousin had seen the figure.

So the figure of the woman in the backseat that my cousin saw, was it the spirit of the woman that her husband left her at the gas station in the dream my sister in law had? Or was it just a coincidence?

Haunted Dream,"North Carolina, United States",Psychic / Medium,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Psychic / Medium :: Haunted Dream

I don't know how haunted this is, and people who haven't read the last story I put up may not know all of what I'm talking about, but here goes. Around last month, I've been having these dreams, the same sort of dreams I've always had. But, they've begun to have a different twist. Before I explain that, I have to say that they are tied in to these other dreams I've had. In these dreams, there's something about blood on my hands.

This dream I thought was a reoccurring dream, I have had it several time, always on my birthday, sometimes between, if that means anything. It's me, being dropped off by my parents at this house, where there's and old lady who is supposed to take care of me. But, she wants to hurt me, so I have to run away. The house is full of all these hidden ways to run, so I always manage to get away, and make it into the attic, where she can't follow. I'm not sure why she can't, only she isn't allowed somehow. There's always something covered by a blanket in the corner, and I always wake up before I lift it.

So, I thought, just your typical dream right? Clearly some sort of way of my mind trying to get me to figure out what I want, by not showing me. Then, the dream changed. I was no longer me, but some other girl, blond, young, hurt. And she/I was the one running from the old lady. I (or, me being the blond) was dressed in this white dress, lying in the dirt. Then we had to run. And there was the chant about the blood on my hands, and I'm not sure what happened, but I woke up, gasping.

That's another thing for me now, I don't wake up screaming, I wake up gasping. Which is much better than before.

So, I sat down with my brother, discussing this, and the possibility that this was somehow connected to my other dreams. The dream with being told to go back to the beginning, the blood on my hands. Then, it sort of clicked with me. The reason my spirit/ghost thing (which is this man I've been dreaming about since I was 15, who I have conversations with in my sleep, who I believe is some sort of spirit, or at the very least no longer human) said to go back to the beginning, he was telling me to go there, back to the first dream I can remember having, that left with the same sort of feeling as one of the screamers (what I call the dreams that wake me up screaming).

I think this girl was there, in that house, and the old woman did something to hurt her, and maybe this girl did something back to her, killed her, or hurt her. That would explain the blood on the hands bit, and maybe why the old lady can't go into the attic.

Maybe I'm grasping at straws, maybe it does all tie together. But, the fact is, I've tried communicating with spirits, and all it left me was a headache. Probably because I'm doing it wrong. But, in my dreams is different.

I guess I need to learn to talk to the things I see, to communicate. Because seeing someone who no one else can see, and you can't figure out how to talk to, does not do much to assure you of your sanity.

Either way, I plan to find this house that I've dreamt about. I think it will hold all the answers. I have no clue where to start, and I'm waiting for spring or summer break to try, so I'll have time to find it. I've been researching haunted houses, but nothing seems to lead me anywhere.

So, what I want to know, is it safe to try to find a place like this? My brother says he's coming with me to 'protect' me from any bad spirits. I don't think there's much a living person can do, and I think for the most part, spirits don't want to hurt us.

Is this making any sense? Should I go? Or is it just a waste of time? I need help deciding.

Mysterious Shower,"Montana, United States",Poltergeists / Physical Manifestations,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Poltergeists / Physical Manifestations :: Mysterious Shower

I had returned from work and decided to relax in the recliner and I ended up falling asleep. My wife came home from work and I woke up for a moment, said hello, and then I fell back to sleep. My wife left the house for about 45 minutes (according to her) and the next thing I know, my wife is waking me up asking if I took a shower. In a sleepy haze I told her that I had not and that I had just been sleeping in the chair. She said that the bathroom was very humid and the mirror was fogged up like someone had taken a shower!

We are fairly baffled by this at this point. Some of the ideas we have had is that I was sleepwalking and took a shower, however my hair was not wet, and I just have a hard time believing that I could take a shower while sleepwalking and then go back to sleep in the chair again. Our other thought was that I had gotten up and turned on the shower, let the steam build up, and then went back to sleep in the chair. I suppose this is a possibility, but I am not a sleepwalker and never have been.

My gut feeling is that I did not move from the chair while my wife was gone. We thought perhaps someone entered our house and took a shower, but we have a dog and I really believe he would have made some noise had someone come inside the house. Anyway, my wife is pretty creeped out at this point and we are both just trying to figure out what happened here. Any ideas?

Uncle Rocky part 4,Canada,Family / Friends Visits,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Family / Friends Visits :: Uncle Rocky part 4

H i again! I've been lucky enough to have some really friendly experiences with spirits, one in particular, Uncle Rocky . I'd like to share some more with you. There are some incidents that may be explained away, except I was there and things just didn't seem to jibe.

In early July, 2006, we had a lovely, breezy day. I noticed my large wind-chime wasn't playing its usual windsong for me. I noticed but thought it must have been tangled. A short time later, I realized that it was chiming away like crazy. I'm not single minded, I'm aware that it really might have been tangled, maybe there was nothing supernatural about it. It seemed worth mentioning because there are so many odd things happening on a regular basis. Almost too coincidental.

Another such event happened not too long after. I have 2 crystal sun-catchers stuck on the small windows of my front door. The door is never used and so always closed. It is off in the very corner of the living room with no source of air flow around it. As I was watching T.V., the rainbow of the sun through the crystals was lazily rolling back and forth on the wall. It caught my eye and I watched for a few minutes until some silly thing on T.V. got my attention and I looked away. When I did look back at them they were perfectly still, then I realized that they should have been still all along since there was no source of air flow at all. I kept one eye on them the rest of that day and on and off since and have never seen the swaying rainbows on the wall since that time. This could be explained, I suppose, but I can't see how because the air doesn't circulate in that corner.

In late August or early September, 2006, (school was still out for summer vacation), my oldest son saw a reflection in the patio door of (what he thought was) his Dad sitting in the rocking chair on the back deck. He went over to the door to speak to him but when he looked out there was no one there. My son hadn't realized that his Dad wasn't even home at the time.

Things seemed to quiet down for a while, or at least we didn't notice anything unusual happening. Then on June 5, 2007, it was floor washing day. It was really windy that day and I figured that with the patio door open, the floors would dry in no time. Once they were dry, I wanted to close the door part way because the wind was so strong coming through that it was causing the plants to bend and whip around. I was afraid they would break off. I put a shoe behind the door to hold it closed part way but the wind was so strong that before I even got out of the room, the door had blown all the way open again. I had a few choice words and thought I'd have to go and shut the door all the way because the wind was just too strong. Just as I started walking back to shut it, the door slammed shut really hard. This I can't explain at all because the wind was blowing directly in the door. I guess Rocky was trying to save me the trip across the room.

My experiences aren't frightening, dramatic or prophetic in any way, I think Rocky just wants us to know he's still around. We think of him and speak of him often, he's in our minds a lot. We're not mourning his loss any more, we just remember him fondly and are happy for the time we had with him. I feel that as long as this is the case, he'll be around us until he decides he's had enough. I find it a comfort that he's keeping us company.

There are more stories to tell and when time permits and the mood strikes, I'll send some more for you to read and hopefully enjoy.

Thanks to all for taking the time to read about my experiences.

George,"Michigan, United States",Haunted Places,"I remember when I was about seven or eight years old, my father worked midnights at Ford Motor Company, therefore he would come home late nights, early mornings. One morning in particular he came home tired but hungry, and decided to make himself a sandwich. While in the kitchen he heard heavy footsteps coming toward him through the hallway. At first he assumed it was just one of my brothers, my mother or myself getting out of bed, but when he walked down the hallway to inspect he found all of us sound asleep snoring. He then thought that perhaps he was so tired he was just hearing things.

About three minutes later, he heard it again, so he called out for my mom ""Diane!"" ""Diane!"" When no answer was received he walked toward the hallway again, realizing nothing had changed, he walked back to continue with his sandwich. Again he heard footsteps so he jokingly yelled ""Knock it off George!"" The footsteps stopped! So in our family each time something strange happened like lights turning on and off, touch lamps going off, televisions turning on and off, my family would simply say ""Knock it off George!"" The best part is if our family went a few weeks with no disturbances we would say George was on vacation somewhere!

A lot of strange occurrences have happened with my family over the years. For example on one occasion when my mother was younger her father yelled at her to turn basement light off, so she ran down and turned the light off, then head to bed. My mother woke to his booming voice telling her to turn off the light like he asked her to. When she insisted she turned the light off my grandmother watched her turn it off and head back to bed. So this time when the light was again turned on, there was no yelling to be had at my mother, only at a ghost!

My mother would come home from school and be home alone for most of the day, so to entertain herself she would stay down in the basement playing. She left an apple downstairs to go up and get something, and not five minutes had passed when she returned to find nothing but an apple core.

She was walking up the basement steps one day only to discover a woman under the stairs, her hair musty and white... Her clothes tattered and old. My mother flew up the stairs faster than she had ever moved her entire life. Later after looking through old family photos it was discovered that it was her great great grandmother. She had never seen her before that.

When my mother grew up and was married, she was in the kitchen cleaning when she heard a noise coming from my brothers bedroom. They were both in cribs and far too young to crawl out to make such a noise. The bedroom was a small space with no windows, so we knew it wasn't the wind, or anyone trying to break in. Walking bravely toward the bedroom she discovered the top layer to her wedding cake in the middle of the floor (The top layer was sitting in a closed closet atop a few other things) The closet was still closed...

Another such instance to happen to my mother was she was driving down the road with her then husband and saw a car sitting sideways across railroad tracks with a woman inside staring at her. Screaming wildly she told her husband they must help the woman and that they needed to stop the car. Her husband looked at my mother as if he had never met her, as if she were a total stranger and calmly said ""There is no car, there is no woman, Diane are you ok?"" Confused my mother returned her eyes toward the railroad tracks, and there was no car, there was no woman...

Close Encounters I Have Had,United Kingdom,A Haunted Life,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: A Haunted Life :: Close Encounters I Have Had

I have had a few supernatural encounters. Nothing particularly scary but very interesting all the same. My first encounter was when I was a young child (about 8) I went to church every Sunday with my parents and once when all the congregation where praying (eyes closed, head down) I saw a monk stood at the altar. At the time I didn't realize what I was seeing and did that thing where you open your eyelids wide with your fingers to ensure your not dreaming or something. I know I didn't imagine it and it was as clear as day. I let the moment pass without saying anything but remember it to this day.

The corner of the church where I saw the Monk I remember always feeling scared when I had to go in there and I would run fast through it, or do what I needed to do and get out quick smart. I wondered if this was just down to being young and not wanting to be alone in a church of all places, but when I go back now I feel the same and quiver all over. It was and still is a modern Methodist church built in the 20th century, carpet and stuff very nice - so not a drafty dark old place, that would create these feelings. - Think I will do a little research on its location.

Second times were at University. I lived with a girl and two lads. The girl had a mother that was a medium. I was studying design and had a large drawing board in my room. I would be drawing away and turn to do something or go make a drink and when I returned, turned back, my pencils, ruler etc would be missing. I would look on the floor to find if it had fell and nothing would be there. I never felt scared and would just say out loud ""I am going down stairs when I return I want them back"" I would do this and sure enough they would be back as is it never been anywhere. My house mate (the girl) said that she once awoke to a man in her bedroom, I believe her as she said she wasn't scared just could see him there.

Third times were many instances when I worked for an Architects practice in the Peak District. Our Offices where haunted by a similar ghost to the one in my Uni house. He used to walk up and down the spiral staircase in the middle of the office (it was a old house) we would hear his foot steps and see him from the corner of our eyes, also he would take drawing equipment etc. We never felt threatened just aware of him. Once on the ground floor, where our reception was I walked down stairs to find the receptionist talking to herself. I said to her, ""who are you talking to"" and she said ""I thought you were just around the corner"" and had been for ten minutes or so as she saw me come down stairs.

Also while working at this practice I had to spend many days on my own in very old Churches that were in the middle of the countryside miles from anywhere. I never saw anything, but I was always VERY apparent to me when I had entered a Church that was haunted. I would be able to feel a presence and also if they were happy with me being there or not.

I got to be aware of this as, all the churches were alike (dark, old, draughty) but some would feel welcoming - just like walking in to your house, others scary.

As I said I never saw anything and whilst surveying towers, crypts, chapels (over 2000 photographs) never ever caught anything on camera (I always checked) but always knew when there was a presence and if it was happy with my presence. If it was happy I would feel content, also aware of them, but not threatened - I used to talk to them to keep me happy.

If it didn't like me being there I would feel not scared just a deep deep sadness (I can feel it now) welling up from inside of me, getting stronger and stronger until I would not be able to take it any longer and I would have to leave or I would have gone crazy. I can only describe it as that sadness, not anger or being scared. Something like when your mad at someone and you bit your tongue, turn the other cheek, but your blood just boils and then you can't help yourself but explode in a fit of rage, or like suffering from vertigo and being high up and just waiting for you inevitable death so you have to get out of there.

I worked with guys that had done the same for almost 50 + years. It was never spoke about if you returned to the office with a half finished survey, it was just silently concluded, accepted that the spirit there was unhappy and there was nothing we could do about it. It happened all the time, and was just treated as an occupational hazard, and we would have to telephone the Vicar and ask them to be in the Church at the same time as we were there. Whether we were in groups our by our self it was always the same.

I have not experienced anything now for 4 - 5 years. I see things out of the corner of my eyes, and then quickly look to the area to find nothing there and nothing possibly that could have caused any movement to attract my attention. But no personal encounters. I have posted on the psychic web site associated with the site about my experiences under that banner that are daily.

I am very interested in all of this and would welcome a discussion.

Friendly Ghosts in my Home,"Illinois, United States",Family / Friends Visits,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Family / Friends Visits :: Friendly Ghosts in my Home

I moved into this house not long after my husband died. It was formerly inhabited by a very negative woman who was also very promiscuous in allowing her boyfriends to move into this home along with her 4 children, her sister, her sisters husband and their 4 children, another ""guest"" who wasn't related and her own husband. That makes 15 people living in a 3 bedroom house. Yes, this tells you a little something about her. Her now ex husband is my new husband. She is no longer living in this house and her brood left with her.

Now the story begins with a woman, Laverne, who died in this house several years ago. She was my husbands first wife's mother. My first experience with her was something interesting, she would move things into their rightful places if I had left them amiss in a room or she would sometimes open doors that could not have been opened by a stray wind. I've always been open minded to such things having grown up with the ghost of a young girl in my childhood home but that is another story. Back to Laverne, she comes to my dreams on occasion and talks to me. If I'm sick, I sometimes feel her stroking my hair when I'm resting or nearly asleep. I've never felt anything negative from her nor has she ever threatened to become so.

Now the issue with this story is, the death of my husband. He was killed in an explosion at work in Columbus, Missouri. We were separated at the time of the accident but since that time I've felt so guilty because I keep thinking if I hadn't asked him to leave, maybe he wouldn't have died. Since that time, I feel as if he's come back to where I am. I can feel someone watching me and it's not Laverene, I know what she feels like and her noises, she has a very distinctive scent as well... Like rain in the morning... Very nice.

Sometimes it smells like something is burning when I walk into a room but nothing ever is. I can feel someone standing near the door to my bedroom at night when everything is dark and the smell of smoke always comes with it. I can't sleep at night since moving into this house, maybe 1 or 2 hours then I'm wide awake though I can sleep fine during the day. This is very unusual for me because I've never been able to sleep during the day because of the light shining through he windows.

My question is... Could this be coming from my own guilt feelings causing this or could he actually be watching over me? He doesn't feel harmful in any way but it just makes me think and worry for him.

The Attic,Iceland,Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: The Attic

I have a lot of Ghosts stories. But I'm not going to tell them all at once. This one happened when I was about 14. I had just recently moved back to Iceland after living in New Zealand for a few years. My mother (who had been living with a guy in his apartment for about a year) lived a apartment with was on top a a two story house.

It was a small apartment with about 3 rooms. One was were my mother and her boyfriend slept, another one for my two younger brothers and one for her boyfriends older son. I was meant to sleep in the attic. It was small, I couldn't stand up straight in some places, but in a way it looked cozy. But it wasn't. I guess most of you are familiar with going into a house and getting the feeling that you shouldn't be in there, or getting the feeling that there's something bad in there.

Well it was like that in the house, except it was worse in the attic. I don't know the history of the house, so I can't really explain it. I always had the feeling that there was a bad spirit where I slept. Who never really did anything except scare me. I'd wake up and see something black. It was like the ghost that I had been seeing since I was 7, and still do now every once in a while. I've been told that there is a evil spirit following me.

In the end, the fear made me move into the bedroom with my two younger brothers. Sometimes at night I'd hear people talking. Once Jóí (My mum's boyfriends son) came home late and I asked him to turn the t.v off (It was coming from the living room and sounded like it was on the t.v) He said he didn't hear anything.

We left there after a few months. My mother told me that there was nothing in the house that was harmful, I might've been the only one who felt it. Like I have been doing my whole life (I'll post more about this spirit later on if anyone is interested).

I never went back there, but that place always gives me the chills when I see it.

My Own Experience of Paralysis,Poland,Old Hags / Night Attacks / Sleep Paralysis,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Old Hags / Night Attacks / Sleep Paralysis :: My Own Experience of Paralysis

L ast fall I moved to Poland with my parents into an apartment duplex. I adore horror movies and ghost stories but I never in my life experienced it actually until one night. (I have had some small ones but nothing big) It was a school night and I fell asleep around 10 or 9, sometime later I woke up, but the strangest thing, I was on my stomach, usually I sleep on my back. I knew I was awake I just knew but I couldn't move. Not one inch. It was the weirdest thing ever and what scared me more was it sounded like someone was pacing back and forth near my bed. Whoever he or she or even it was... just seemed to pace back and forth and muttering something.

I have no idea what. I felt like I couldn't breathe and I was slightly gasping. Then I sort of blacked out. When I fully awake I was able to get up but I sat up confused. Was it just a dream? I sort of shrugged my shoulders but I still felt creepy. It's been a year and nothing like that really happened and my duplex is new so it isn't haunted but was it just too much sleep?

My mom never comes too my room when I'm sleeping and neither does my dad I know them too well. I also have no siblings so if anyone had an experience like this can they comment please? Thank you.

Flickering Lights,"California, United States",Poltergeists / Physical Manifestations,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Poltergeists / Physical Manifestations :: Flickering Lights

I 've already told one ghost story but this is another slightly smaller one. When I was younger and still lived in the US in california, we lived in a town house. Personally I love the small home (except for the bugs) but sometimes it freaks me out.

When I was 7 my dad was reading to me in bed some story when suddenly my lamp started flickering on and off. I stared at it and asked my dad what it was. My dad (ever the christian) smiled and suggested ""Maybe it's god"". I believed him but still felt a bit freaked. A couple years later I had a friend over for a sleep over and it was maybe 9 at night when my lamp started flickering on and off. Elizabeth (my friend) asked if it was an old bulb. I said no, my dad had changed it the other day. We both got scared and giggling, ran downstairs parking ourselves in front of the tv.

A year later maybe I was home alone and going into my room when, guess what, my lamp started flickering off and on. I ignored it but on and off on and off it went for about 15 minutes. It was near dark and I was too freaked to stay in my room so I stayed in the living room until my parents came home.

Later when my friends and I were telling ghost stories to each other I told them my flickering light story. They thought it was creepy but said it was a coincidence. I don't believe it. Sometimes I feel that something was in my room... Even though I have moved now I still wonder why had my lamp gone all haywire towards night?

My Buddy Is a Ghost,"New York, United States",Misc,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Misc :: My Buddy Is a Ghost

Y ou know when you were a little kid and you had no one to play with so you made up an imaginary friend. Then once you got to be in your teenage years they fade away. Well I had at least 3 imaginary pals, I had Cloey, Allison, and Andrew. Now I named each of them because of the following reasons. I named Cloey because she looked like me and she was sort of like a ""Clone"" so I named her Cloey. Then Allison would be another name of mine if my name wasn't Alyssa, she sort of was the girlie side of me. Then there was Andrew, he was just like me, but a boy, my name would be Andrew if I was a boy, so that's why I named him that.

Well I got rid of all of these imaginary friends when I was 10 years old. But the other day, the weirdest thing happened, I could of sworn that I saw Andrew, but in real life, not a imaginary friend. Except he looked different.

I was talking to my friend in the hallway at school, but I kept on looking at the clock because I wanted to know when I should go to class. When I looked for the maybe 8th time, I looked down a bit, and I saw a boy just staring at me who looked like Andrew. I said to my friend ""Do you see a boy leaning against the wall?"" She said no when she turned around, but I can see him. Like really see him, when I was a 9 year old, I always just pictured him in my head, I never saw him. That afternoon, when I went home, I can see him everywhere, in the mirror, in the dining room, and in the living room.

I was getting pretty freaked out. I fell asleep in my mom's room that night, and when I went into my room around maybe 1:30, I saw Andrew sitting on my bed. I didn't say anything, neither did he, but I sort of communicated in my head with him, like we reading each other mind's. This is our conversation I remember it clearly:

Andrew: I got hit by a car, I'm a ghost now, I came to say good bye.

Andrew: You had to, you were getting older, uh... I got to go now.

And then he left, like that! If you don't believe, it's ok. I even told my friend about him, and I will tell her he died. Just tell me what you think.

Interview with a Witch: The Donna Reynolds Story,"California, United States",Ghost Hunting,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Ghost Hunting :: Interview with a Witch: The Donna Reynolds Story

I waited in an area that had a picnic bench with a clump of trees for my interview with a real witch. The area was somewhat remote and I looked around and saw nothing around me. Then I heard some birds chirping and from a clearing at this park, a mysterious woman in black appeared out of nowhere and started walking towards me. She said...""hi, I'm Donna, I'm your witch..."" I looked at Donna and said...""step in my office and let's do this interview, have a seat..."" As I pointed at the park bench table. Donna relates to me that she has been interested in the Wiccan culture since the time she was in high school. Her screen name is a Gaelic name, it's Badb. Badb is named after the Celtic goddess Badb Catha, she may take on the name of Badb as her permanent craft name, but hasn't decided yet. The circle she belongs to is Sacred Fire Circle, which is having it's Sacramento Mabon Celebration 2007, it will be an open circle and everyone is invited. They will conduct a leaf burning ceremony, to release negativity into the atmosphere. Each member and guest will receive an acorn, which represents future harvests.

Donna tells me that she became a practicing witch in 2003, she has extensively studied the Wiccan culture and embraced it full heartedly. She will never forget the time, that she was with a group of Wiccans and they were singing chant songs to the God Thor. The Lady of the Circle named Belisama Fire lead the group into chant. The more they chanted, the night became stormy. The presence of Thor was felt and all of a sudden, it started to rain in buckets, the heavy winds blew wildly and the tarp that gave them shelter blew to the ground. When the chanting resided, everything went back to normal. They later learned that there was no other storm anywhere else, the storm only hit the location of where the Circle was at.

Donna has recently joined H.P.I. (Haunted and Paranormal Investigations) of Northern California, as a Paranormal Investigator and went on their 2007 Haunted Placerville Tour (haunting investigation). When going on this tour, Donna was surprised to feel a wall of energy at one of the locations she visited on this tour. But, this is not the first time Donna has dealt with the paranormal, she has been plagued by the paranormal since the age of 16. When Donna first contacted me, to write her story (an occurrence that happened in the Fall of 1972 in Niceville, Florida), she sent me this in her own words:

""I lived in a double-wide mobile home for four years with my parents in a mobile home park on Eglin Air Force Base near the Gulf Coast of Florida when I was in high school. At that time, if the military member was sent overseas for a short tour, the family had to move off-base until the member's return.

When my father received orders for a one-year stint in Thailand in the early 1970's, we moved the mobile home to Niceville, a small town near the base. My parents bought an unimproved lot and had trees taken down, electricity put in, a septic tank installed, and whatever else needed to improve this piece of property. Within a very few weeks, my father was off to Thailand and my mother and I lived in the mobile home alone.

I was in Georgia on a high school band trip when my parents made the actual move. I got home around 10:00 PM a couple of days later. My room was not set up yet, so my mother got me a pillow and blanket and set me up on the couch in the living room. That night, my first night in this home, my sleep was disturbed my multiple noises - mostly knocking on the wall and the sound of footsteps. I'd been in a similar situation when I was very young, and for some reason did not feel afraid. I just said out loud, ""Please let me go to sleep!"" and the noises stopped.

The next day I was in the backyard exploring. I have always loved nature and became interested in a line of ants traveling across the yard. I found their nest and squatted on my haunches to look at them. I suddenly felt a hand on my back and was pushed forward to the point where I had to put my hands out in front of me to catch myself from falling on my face. I told my parents about it and they just laughed at me. Nothing else happened for several weeks, except once when I was pushed again, this time in my bedroom while my father was putting some shelves together for me. When I was pushed, I nearly fell on top of him.

For the year and a half that my mother and I lived in the home, there were many incidents where we heard knocking on the walls, footsteps, sobbing (from my room), bad smells like something had died, light fixtures coming on by themselves when they weren't plugged in, a fire-ant invasion in my mother's toilet, shadows in the window, a blob of gray mist hanging beneath the ceiling, the sound of water dripping (the drops sounded like they were falling from a height not possible where the sound was coming from), light switch sounds but no lights going on or off, my name being called, cold spots, a feeling of not being alone - and even a full-figure apparition on one occasion of a very petite or young female with a long dress and lots of hair piled up on her head - much like the ladies wore in the Civil War era. These events became more and more frequent as time went on.

We also had other family members that visited during this time and they, too, had experiences. The interesting fact about all of this, is that none of them, including my father, shared their experiences with my mother or me for fear of scaring us. My uncle and my grandfather visited together once, and didn't share their experiences with either of us or each other. It was only years later that my family, including my father shared their experiences with my mother and I. We were all in awe of the fact that we had all had separate experiences that were collaborated years after the fact.

We eventually sold the place because my father received orders for Travis AFB near Fairfield, CA. We had no idea about any problems at the site since then. We know that the mobile home we put there is gone and there is another in its place. That's the extent of my knowledge of these experiences at the time of this writing.

The only information I have to offer right now is that Niceville, FL, was at one time a very small fishing village. The lot we lived on was very near the water. We can only surmise that at one time there either was a settlement of some sort or maybe a homestead on or near the property my parents bought.

Below are added comments from Donna, as she relates to experiences she had in her present home in Rancho Cordova:

""Once, while I was home alone I was sitting in the den watching TV when I heard my name called. I was sitting on a couch that was in front of a large window, and the voice sounded like it came from outside, through the window behind me. I couldn't tell if it was male or female because it was almost a whisper, but not quite. It just said, ""Donna"".

Another time, my mother, a family friend name Eunice, her two teenage children, Sue and Jim, my friend from next door, Debbie, and I were all sitting outside in the backyard having a good time. Sue, Debbie, and I decided to go next door to Debbie's house for a while. Debbie and I walked around the back end of the house, through the front yard, out the gate at the front (hitch) end and to the road. At the road we had to double back the other direction as Debbie’s house was next to the back end of mine, causing us to travel the length of the front of my house toward hers. In the meantime, Sue went inside through the back door near the end of the house to use the bathroom. I go into such detail to illustrate the time it took for us to make the trip vs. The time it took Sue to reach the bathroom. It was starting to get dark and the lights were on in the living room and the curtains were drawn. When Debbie and I reached the road we both, for some reason, looked toward the house and we both saw a shadow of a male figure in the curtains of the living room window. As we watched, the figure moved out of the window, in the direction of the back of the house where the back door and bathroom were. We both ran to her house and told her mother what we had just witnessed. As we were finishing our story, Sue came in looking very white. She said that while she was in the bathroom, she heard footsteps coming from the living room area of the house and walking toward the back. Time-wise, it was exactly at the same time that Debbie and I saw the shadow.

Once, coincidentally while I was living at that home, my boyfriend and I had just returned from a date and were standing in the driveway when we both saw what we thought was a UFO. It was a reddish light that just stood very still in the night sky and finally just vanished after a few minutes. Also, one dark, moonless night my mother and I were driving south on Sunrise Blvd. Here in Rancho, somewhere between the American River and Folsom Blvd. When we saw some kind of ship fly toward us from our right. It made a large sweep over us and turned back in the direction from which it came, and flew off. It was huge and the lights were in an elongated triangle pattern. It did have blinking lights but was either too large or too close to be an airplane - it was too dark to tell. If I were to hold my hands out at arms length to describe how much windshield space it took up, I would have to hold my hands about three feet apart!""

Donna believes she is an empath and her whole family is a magnet for the supernatural. From the time she was 16 and up to the age of 17, she lived in a mobile home in Niceville. She experienced ghostly encounters, as mentioned above in her blurb. I discuss what she wrote to me about her experiences and ask Donna was there anything else that was unusual. She said, one day her dad walked into a room and it was filled with smoke. Her dad thought it was a fire and when he looked again, the smoke was gone. On another night, family and friends felt an icy cold presence move through the home. Donna's ex-boyfriend on another night noticed the flashlight dimming on its own, then the lights in the home came on for no apparent reason. Donna always felt presences at this home and she wonders if the small fishing village that once was on this property had anything to do with the presences of this home.

Donna goes on to tell me that 2/3rds of her life has been experiences of the paranormal. She has seen ghost animals, a luring ghost cat. She once saw a ghostly hand move the shower curtain. She has seen 'shadow people' move about the house. Once while laying in bed, she felt someone sitting on the bed and it caused an indentation on the bed. All through her life from her grandmother's home in Pocahontas, Virginia to the Mobile Home in Niceville, Florida to Castle AFB (at this AFB housing community, she witnessed the animal spirits, the entity that sat on her bed and the shadow people) to her present home in Rancho Cordova where there are at times poundings on her walls. Donna feels that her family attract entities from the other side and her connection to the Wiccan culture goes back as far as to her grandmother, who was known as ""Grannie"".

Perhaps entities that dwell in the realm of the supernatural are attracted to Earth people known as Wiccans, because Wiccans embrace nature and respect the Earth. The Earth and nature is filled with energy and the harmonious nature of energy embraces the Wiccan culture and brings on energy entities to watch over them and to protect them. Donna is a unique young lady and she is filled with stories of her encounters with the supernatural. So many stories, that it would fill a good size book. I am honored to write a small piece of her life, because I have met a woman who is one with nature. As she departed into the surrounding area of trees, I felt a small gentle breeze go with her.

It Happened at Gun Point,"Georgia, United States",Family / Friends Visits,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Family / Friends Visits :: It Happened at Gun Point

I t was August 28th 1998 and I had been back in Atlanta about a month. I had transferred from Maryland with my job and was thrilled to be home with my family and friends. The previous year had been a tough one. I lost a job and Robb and I had finally called it quits. I was still trying to sell a house in Maryland so Mom was nice enough to let me stay with her for the time being. It was the back to school season at work and I had been working long and very late hours.

My District Manager had asked if I would work the Alpharetta store. It was a large volume store and she felt I was experienced enough to be able to handle the crowds. From the moment I started at this store I felt like everything was out of control. We didn't have enough employees and we didn't have time during the day to search for people. We were desperately trying to keep enough merchandise on the floor to satisfy the throngs of students heading back to school. The General Manager had also transferred from Maryland and she understood my anxiety and frustration with this new store.

The night of the incident I had the closing shift and she came to me and asked if I had a plan to recover the store. I told her that we would stay until we were back in shape and ready for work tomorrow. We left around 12am and the store was in fair condition. I walked out with Jamal and I thanked him for all his help and then I got in my car and drove home. The drive home was uneventful but I had a feeling that I was being followed. When I turned on Sheridan the feeling was really strong but I was almost home so I ignored my better judgment.

As I pulled in the driveway those feelings went away and all I could think of was sleep. I opened the door of the car and stepped out. I was immediately confronted by a man dressed in all black pointing a gun in my face. I screamed but then I decided I didn't want Mom to wake up and come out. I didn't want her to get hurt and she might make things worse. So I became quiet and he told me to come with him. At first I thought he wanted me, but then he told me that we were going back to the store and that I was going to open the safe for him. I was calmed knowing that all he really wanted was money. I was also calmed by the fact that there was another presence or entity with me helping me through this.

My Dad had passed away in 1993 but I knew that he was still there watching over Mom. He was angry that this was happening at his house, I could feel his anger and at one point he took a swing at the guy with the gun. Then he stayed with me through the whole evening. The first man put me in the back seat of an old camaro or firebird. He then grabbed my car keys and took off. I was worried that he would go in the house and hurt Mom. I was also upset because I had an old church key that belonged to Dad on that key ring. Dad sat next to me and held my hand and the second man told me we were going back to the store and nothing would happen to me if I would be cooperative.

I was worried about Mom and so I started talking to the driver and asked why he took my keys. He told me that they needed to dump the car we were in and they were going to take my car. I asked if they had plans to go in the house. I was assured that all they wanted was the car. I could feel Dad assure me that everything would be okay. We got to the store and the man opened the door and grabbed my arm and told me to come with him. He had a gun pointed at my ribs and he told me not to look at him. I had lost a contact lens in the back seat of the car so I couldn't see much anyway.

Dad followed me and kept telling me to stay calm that this would be over soon. The man told me to unlock the store and then he directed me to the alarm panel. He warned me not to do anything stupid because he would use the gun if he needed to. I turned the alarm off and then he directed me to the cash office. He told me to open the safe and he also wanted all the laptops in our lockup area. He told me to unlock that room too. I did what he asked and he handed me a canvas bag and told me to open the safe and put all the money in the bag. I opened the top of the safe and put all the bills and some rolled coins in the bag.

What the robber didn't know was that most of the cash was in the bottom of the safe and I had no intention of opening it unless he demanded it. He then took the bag and tied my hands and feet together and told me to lay down on the floor and that he would be back. The minute he left I jumped up and hobbled to the door and slammed the door closed. He couldn't get in the cash office without the key. I then was able to wiggle out of the tape on my hands and set off the alarm. Dad stayed with me the whole time.

I called the police and I called my GM and DM to let them know I was OK. When I got home about 4am that morning I told Mom about Dad being with me through out the whole ordeal and she was not surprised nor did she think I was crazy or delusional. She knows he watches her and she feels his presence too. She feels that he wants to make up in death what he was not able to give us in life.

For me he has given me more in that one night than I could ever ask. Thanks Dad, I Love you.

Thistle Hill Ft Worth,"Texas, United States",Psychic / Medium,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Psychic / Medium :: Thistle Hill Ft Worth

I must admit that I have some strange friends but being Texans we tell good stories... My friend Laurie considers herself to be a sensitive, I must admit that she has experienced some of the weirdest things during her lifetime and I have been fortunate enough to have heard her tales.

One of Laurie's friends was getting married at a rather famous old mansion here in Ft Worth, Texas called Thistle hill house. This magnificent 11,000 square foot house is beautiful and was built for a woman named Electra Waggoner by her father A.B Wharton in 1903 for $46,000 (A fortune at the time but he was a cattle baron and excess was the game). The story is that A.B built the house for Electra so she would wait on getting married to care for her motherless younger siblings until they were old enough to leave the house on their own. Electra took up old Dad on this offer and raised her siblings in exchange of this house built to her specifications. Don't worry Electra did eventually get married and didn't die alone.

Regardless this house is gorgeous and the perfect setting for a grand wedding if you can afford it. Seriously go to google type Thistle hill Ft Worth, TX and it should pull up the house's web site and you can see the insanely beautiful rooms (very classy). Laurie was at this house for a wedding and they allow the brides to use an upstairs bridal room to change and get ready for their big moment. Laurie had helped her friend get ready for the wedding and the bridal party moved downstairs to prepare for the ceremony. The bride forgot her veil in the upstairs dressing room and asked Laurie to go back upstairs to retrieve it prior to the ceremony starting. I believe that Laurie was a bridesmaid and I'm very sure because this was in the 1980's that she was looking hot in bright orange taffeta (She hosts a nightmare bridesmaids ball every year and tells everyone invited to wear their most horrible bridesmaid's outfits just for funsies)

Laurie went back upstairs and passed by a parlor room to the right of the bridal dressing room and a woman in 1900's period dress stepped out of the parlor and dipped her head ""hello"" at Laurie and the continued down the hallway towards the staircase. Laurie just assumed that the woman was a character actor hired by the household to show authenticity.

After Laurie's friend's beautiful wedding took place and the reception was underway Laurie saw the proprietor of the building and she walked over and said that she enjoyed the character actor dressed in period clothing. The proprietor looked puzzled and said that they didn't have anyone like that working in the building especially not during a wedding. Laurie then told the proprietor what she had seen when she went back up the stairs and the proprietor smiled and said ""Well, it might have been Electra"". Apparently Electra likes to greet guests of the house and attend weddings. Laurie thought that this was great fun and continued to have a wonderful time at the wedding.

Ghost Shoe,"California, United States",Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: Ghost Shoe

I n about 2003, I was sitting in my room, doing homework, and talking on the phone with my best friend. I heard someone knocking on my door and I looked out, but no one was there. I left my door open and stared at it. A few minutes later, I saw a transparent sneaker. It was really weird and only had a leg attached to it.

Ever since then, we have taken pictures with orange streaks of light in my parents room. Sometimes, I hear scratching on my window at night. And when I'm by myself, I see stuff run across the living room. It happened a number of times and still freaks me out. And every time I watch a scary movie, I see the sneaker and severed leg. I see streaks of light fleet across my room, kitchen, and living room.

My house get cold and eerie at night time and one time, I was outside and I saw a transparent tiger jump out of my tree. And sometimes, when my dad takes a shower, like today, the water gets cold, hot, cold, hot, cold hot. And keeps doing that. It freaks me out.

And sometimes I see something over my shoulder when I look in the mirror. It scares me. My house is haunted! My brother always is looking at the spot where I see the ghost. He cries and clenches onto me and my dad. I see it all the time now.

A Ghost Saved my Life,Australia,Misc,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Misc :: A Ghost Saved my Life

W hen I was about 4 years old, my nan was looking after me and her house was a really nice one, except for downstairs. Downstairs made you feel terrible, there was definitely something there. My mum, me and my aunt all felt a presence and felt as though we were being watched.

Being 4 years old I was very wary of going down there. So this day I was riding around upstairs on my little plastic bike and nan insisted on my staying away from the stairs. The stairs were extremely steep and my mind is a blank from the time where I was riding around until I somehow found myself facing the stairs. I remember looking down the stairs and thinking how did I get here?

Then I felt myself being pushed and there I was, hurtling down the stairs on this plastic bike. Based on the laws of physics, the bike should have tumbled over throwing me off it face first. Yet somehow I remained balanced though thinking back it seems impossible how I could have done so. Not only this, with the speed I was going down the stairs I should have been thrown straight through the glass window which was only about a meter from the bottom stair. As I reached the bottom I felt my bike and me stop dead as though someone had caught me.

So it seems as though someone made me go to the stairs, pushed me down where I could easily have been killed... but then I was also stabilized and saved from breaking my neck while hurtling down the stairs and then caught at the bottom and stopped from flying through a thick glass window. Perhaps there were two people there, one trying to hurt me, one trying to save me? I don't know, what do you reckon?

Also found out after nan had moved that 2 owners of the house had died.

Daddy's Girl,Philippines,Apparitions / Voices / Touches,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Apparitions / Voices / Touches :: Daddy's Girl

I don't believe in ghosts nor do I believe in magic or anything that has got to do with the paranormal but one experience stuck with me. My dad died when I was 5 months old. He hanged himself when my mother left him. It never felt weird to me since I grew up knowing everything that happened and I was never ashamed to tell people how my dad died.

When I was 6 years old, my cousins used to sleep over our place every time their family visits us. We would sleep in the living room while the adults catch up on events and spend the rest of the night talking in the balcony. That particular day in summer I had a fever when they came to visit, so I slept early while my younger cousins lay beside me trying also to fall asleep.

We always have a red light on at night because my aunt, who was also my guardian (since my mom went abroad), hates waking up in the middle of the night in the dark. That night I saw a man standing in the doorway, his head was tilted on one side and he had his tongue out, he was staring at me. He looked sad and scary at the same time but it didn't really scare me although thinking about it, now gives me goose bumps. I haven't seen my dad in person but I've seen his pictures, I wanted to believe it was not him because I didn't want to think he would want to scare me, but who else would it be?

The next day I told my uncles (my dad's brothers) about the incident and uncle fred told me I was just hallucinating since I had a fever, but uncle mike looked shocked though he never told me why. It was when I was already in high school that my aunts told me that myka, one of my younger cousins, told uncle mark that she saw a man standing on that doorway that night, and that was before I told him I've seen my dad.

I never had any experiences with regards to my dad after that. Well so much for saying goodbye to her only daughter.

It Came as a Familiar,"North Carolina, United States",Old Hags / Night Attacks / Sleep Paralysis,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Old Hags / Night Attacks / Sleep Paralysis :: It Came as a Familiar

T his experience happened to me back in the early nineties. I had been dating a girl that had at one time been involved in witchcraft and at the time I was living alone in an apartment. The apartment had hard wood floors throughout so you could definitely hear if someone else was walking in another room. I always had an eerie feeling like I was being watched but would dismiss it as much as possible.

One night I went to bed as usual having set my alarm clock for 6 am in order to get up for work. The alarm clock was facing the bed so I could see it at all times. A noise brought me out of a deep sleep and into a semiconscious state, enough for me to see the clock and know what time it was. It was exactly 1:01. And I remember thinking great! I have 5 more hours to sleep! I always sleep on my side in the fetal position and on this occasion my left hand was hanging off the bed.

At that instant I hear foot steps coming through the house sounding like my girlfriend's boots she always wore, getting closer and closer. Then whatever it was started speaking to me in her voice! Trying to convince me that it was her! I remember trying to move but I was completely paralyzed and could not. I spoke back saying ""NO YOUR NOT!"" It kept on until it finally reached my bed speaking sweetly in her voice. My bedroom door was closed so it had came right through it. I could still see the clock, keep in mind, but I could not see my uninvited guest. There was a brief moment of silence.

Then I started feeling the bed move behind me. And I said one more time, ""YOU'RE NOT KELLY!"" At that instant I felt hot breath on my ear and the voice changed from her voice into a man's and said ""how did you know""? That's when I finally snapped out of it and jumped out bed nearly pissing myself and ran over to the light switch and turned it on. Along with every other one in house! There wasn't anything there. It had came and gone in a minute but what had seemed an eternity.

Like I said, the whole time I was desperately trying to move but was frozen in terror. Some people would simply say that it was just a dream. But I'm here to tell you that it was definitely NOT. Needless to say, shortly thereafter I stopped seeing her.

A few years later I had another experience that I will share at another time.

Dreams of the Deceased,"South Carolina, United States",Family / Friends Visits,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Family / Friends Visits :: Dreams of the Deceased

A couple days ago, I had a dream about a girl I went to school with that is deceased. In my dream there were a ton of people in a building. I felt like I knew all of them, yet I didn't recognize them. Different people would come up to me and start talking. Then the girl that I knew came up and she asked me how I was doing and said she hadn't seen me in awhile. We talked for a little bit.

I asked her what she has been up to and she said she has been ""working on her family"". Then a boy came up to me and started talking to me and gave me a hug. He looked so much like my husband's deceased cousin that I never met. The whole time I was with him, he was so nice to me. It felt like I knew him as well, but I didn't know who he was. Near the end of the dream, he gave me another hug and he told me that he would see me again really soon.

I don't know why I had that dream. I have a lot of weird dreams that usually mean something. Most of the time they don't make sense until later on. What I would like to know is if anyone else has this same kind of thing happening to them. Do any of you ever have dreams about someone deceased or even just a dream that means something? I know that my mom's friend and my dad experience this kind of thing all the time. So at least I know that I am not dealing with this completely alone.

Jinn in Childhood,"Louisiana, United States",Misc,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Misc :: Jinn in Childhood

H ere's a few of my other encounters that I've had a while back. All of them mostly happened in my younger days, but I almost always had a witness. When I was younger I used to spend my weekends at my cousin's house. During one of my first visits there he said to me, ""Weird stuff happens here around 12:00 a.m..."" I really didn't believe him, but at 12:04 I had my first ghost (jinn) encounter.

The living room layout had the kitchen door behind and to the right of the couch. In the kitchen there was a cabinet with a glass front that reflected the whole kitchen. During that time we heard a cabinet door open and shut then we heard a bunch open and shut over and over, but we were looking at the reflection and saw nothing moving. We hopped over the couch and ran into the kitchen to find nothing moving and the noise had stopped. That's not the best story in the world, but it was my first and I had a witness.

One other one was a shorter one that involved a friend of mine at my grandmother's house. Her house is old so the floors creak and the kitchen is beside the living room almost the same room. One night we were laying on two separate couches and talking to each other when we heard footstep creaks walking into the kitchen. We thought it was her so said, ""Hey grandma...hey?"" We got no reply and no light ever came on we then looked up and no one was there.

The last one I am going to say is my best one besides my motorcycle one I already posted. One night we were at my same grandmother's house. My cousin (Chance) from above and my other cousin (Marcus) are the people in this story. There is a vacant trailer that is beside my grandmother's house and at the time I lived in it... sadly. We were young and wanted to check it out at night. Marcus went in first, Chance went in second and I trailed.

I was the lookout in case anyone came. On the way towards the back past the kitchen is my room then my sister's room. Marcus went to the far back towards my sister's room and Chance walked my room and found an old train toy. He opened my door and threw it in and closed the door. I was almost behind him at the time and we decided nothing was going on so we were going to leave. On our way out Chance passed my old door and at that time the door opened and the toy flew past his head! We freaked out and took off running and didn't go back in there at night anymore. I still feel weird going in there sometimes. I believe it's more of a jinn messing with us than anything.

Are All of You in Here Dead?,Kuwait,Misc,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Misc :: Are All of You in Here Dead?

S hortly after falling asleep like many times before, the dream interruptions starts out very suddenly and, out of the blue, and without warning. The next thing I know, boom! I'm there, on the other side... I was standing on a play ground it was a vividly bright day but, had a golden tint about it, all most like looking through tented glass. As I looked around to get my bearings I saw that the ground was dusty and, there was no sign of grass anywhere. The buildings that was in the far ground seemed so, very distant and, there was no one around, but as I turned I saw a building that wasn't there before just on the other side of a chain link fence.

I walked through the fence then toward this building then stopped when I noticed it was a single story structure built in the forties it looked like a school. At the door I felt something, the sense of peace, but never trusted that feeling, I walked in and once inside my whole world had changed from what was golden rays of sun light to a gray dimly lit room with one other door facing me, as I walked closer, it was a kitchen and, standing at the sink with her back to me was a woman.

She was wearing a white dress with large red roses on it. The dress was so detailed I noticed the green leaves on the stems. The lady was tall and slender and her hair was jet black pulled back and was on her shoulders. Then she turned around, she was my mother. My Mother! My first thoughts were; what is she doing here? Automatically I ask myself how this can be. I'm older then she, this lady had to be 26 years old and beautiful. My Mom is 70 + and, beautiful. Oh God I must be losing my mind, she looked exactly like my Mom did when my siblings and, I were just babies. The fear sat in as I looked into her eyes; NO! They weren't my Mom's eyes at all.

It was time to get out of the world, so I turn toward the door. The door! The door that I had come in, it was gone, there was only one option and, I had to get passes this lady to reach the other door. I did but, only to find myself yet, in another room. This room led me down a long hallway and, it too was old and seemingly, empty. I rushed toward the end, and was stopped by the sound of music.

Halfway down the hall was a double door. I started walking toward it, that's when I heard lots of people talking; there was music playing in the back ground as well. Just as I was about to enter I was approached by another spirit that took the form of a man, honestly I couldn't totally be sure about the gender because my mind was focused on all of the people that I saw there. I found that it was standing too close; I pushed him away as I move quickly into this very, very large dance hall.

Most of the people were sitting and, some was standing, but the strangest thing that struck me to be quite odd, was the people that was sitting was motionless like in a nod. Very darn eerie, to the point where I knew and I felt out of place there, and don't ask me why, but I felt the need to know so I yelled out over the loud music. ""ARE ALL OF YOU IN HERE ARE DEAD?"" and to my surprise someone said yes, so turn toward the voice and he said. ""My name is June"" One guy yelled out, it was just like that a burden had lifted from my shoulders because in my mind I knew they were the spirits of that died.

Then one by one these spirits came up asking me questions about this and about that. There was one question that I had to ask June Bug ""What I'm I going here?"" but before I had a chance to do so, a lady walked up to me. I would like to say that this was a deferent kind of spirit. What I mean, I thought because of her eyes had a curious look and, her face was a little saddened, it could have been the fact that she was dead and, she wanted to be with the living and, her love ones. I don't know, but there something there that touched my heart.

We stood together, looking into each other eyes then she glanced away never saying a word, she didn't have to say anything, I think her eyes said it all. I was just about to turn to June when I told this female spirit that she was very beautiful. It was satisfying to watch her blush and smile. It was seconds after I told her that, someone manifested behind me. Hiding himself but, I saw him out of the corner of my eye. I cannot ignore these types of spirits because they are sneaky, evil cowards.

What happened next had sent me into furious rage. Seconds after this spirit had manifested behind me, her face had turned into rotting flesh and worms right before my eyes. Still smiling she didn't have a clue what was happening to her face, NOT A CLUE! June had whispered something to her. When she did realize her face was rotting away, she placed both hands over her face as busted into tears.

June and, I had the same idea, but I was more afraid and didn't have the nerve to comfort her. (I really don't want to say this, but the truth is the truth) I know for a fact that the spirit of my dead Father was hiding behind me, I'm 100% sure that he was the cause of that female spirit face to change as it did. I then turned around to confront this problem; only to find that he was gone, as well as all of the spirits except two, and that was June and the lady.

I know that this story is deep, I've been holding back long enough; finally having the courage to face my demons, and expose them to the pubic so, that people can understand the unnatural things that are happening to them are spirit related.

Pontianak,Singapore,Apparitions / Voices / Touches,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Apparitions / Voices / Touches :: Pontianak

I am Victoria. I have always had the interest in listening to ghost stories. In fact, I always believed them. These are really true. My dads cousin, troy, was one day at his army camp. After taking a shower, he switched off the lights. Then he went down the stairs. Suddenly, the light turned on. He was not shocked, and just went back to switch off the light. Again, the light turned on. He was confused now, and thought someone was playing a trick on him. So, again he switched it off. The lights turned on again, and he saw a pontianak laughing and flying up near the ceilings. He ran and got on his motor cycle, and never wanted to come back.

Let me explain what is a pontianak. A pontianak is a women. They never come after women or girls like me, well because pontianaks die with their babies still in there stomachs. If you do not rub eggs under their armpits when they die, they will become one. They can be up in trees most of the time. Do not ever urinate under the tree or they will come after you.

Nightmares about Ghosts,"Oregon, United States",Misc,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Misc :: Nightmares about Ghosts

F or many years now, I have been plagued by nights of horrible dreams, many recurring with the same thing in common... Ghosts! They always scare me so much I often wake crying and drenched in sweat. The houses that I'm in (in my dreams) are always different but there are many similarities in my dreams.

First of all, I am always with other people, usually my friends, like it's a house party situation. Secondly the ghost always haunts only one room, and everyone present knows about the room and the ghost and avoids it, yet we talk about it when we are together and the strange things that happen because of the ghost. Thirdly I always end up alone in the room where the ghost haunts at some point, I never see the ghost, but I always feel the oppression and evil that it emits, I should say that she emits because the ghost is always a female.

I don't know if it's always the same ghost but I always get the same feelings of dread and fear when I'm alone. Another similarity in my ghost dreams is when I'm alone in the haunted room, I always try to get out but can't, I'm trapped, I call for my friends but it's like they've left me alone in this haunted place. My dreams have yet to progress to any harm caused to me by the ghost and I feel this is due to the fact that I am so scared and uncomfortable that I force myself to awaken, sometimes when I fall back asleep I go right back to where I've left off.

I usually have a dream like this at least once a month and I can't understand why? Who is this ghost woman, and why am I so afraid of her, why don't I fight her in my dreams? Why don't I try to figure what's going on? Why does it frighten me more than anything else I've experienced in real life or in other nightmares?

Night Stalker,"Virginia, United States",,"I t started when I was about seven years old. It was around midnight and I was thirsty so I decided to go downstairs and get a class of water. I had just fixing to go down the stair when a hand shot out of the darkness and grabbed me by the throat. I stood there with this hand clasped tightly around my throat for what seemed like ages. Finally the hand let go and I ran right back to my bedroom and got under the covers and pulled them over my head.

The next day I told my parents about what happened and they said that I was just imagining things and shouldn't watch scary movies before I go to bed. That same night I told my parents about what happened I was being punched and prodded by the thing that had grabbed me. The next day my mother saw the bruises I got and asked my brother had he been hitting me. He said no and told her he had been seeing strange lights in front of my bedroom and would hear my name being called out at night when he went to use the bathroom.

The next day while my brother and I were playing outside in the woods we saw a row of five or six tombstones. We ran to the house and showed our parents. They believed us after that and we moved out of the house three months later.

To this day I think the ghost has followed me because I still wake up with strange bruises and her my name being called out in the night.

The Little Boy in the Night,"Texas, United States",Children Who See Spirits,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Children Who See Spirits :: The Little Boy in the Night

M y son just turned 4, and we have rented a small duplex since he was a year old. He has always been reluctant to play in his room alone and would never give an answer as to why. Usually he falls asleep on the couch, and we carry him to his bed. We thought this was normal, as he doesn't want to miss anything.

For the past few weeks my son has been in my bed when I wake up. I don't usually hear him come in, but my husband does. It is always between 3:30 and 4 am. When asked why, my son says that he sees a little boy in his room. He says he thinks the little boy is a monster because he changes into something else. We are still unsure as to what the something else is. My son has told us stories about things moving under the bed, or in the closet, or ""the noises"" in his room. He tells us all the time that ""the noises"" in his room are back. I always thought I had a rational explanation for these things, either a tree outside, or squirrels in the attic, or the fan blowing the bed skirt. Now I am not so sure as to what these noises are.

Two nights ago my son was again in my room, and my husband had moved to the couch for lack of space in the bed. I woke up and my son was standing by the door holding on to it. I asked him what he was doing, to which he replied, ""the door won't stop opening and closing"". He was completely calm, not scared, just said this matter-of-factly. I told him it was ok, and he could lay back down my bed.

My son says the boy doesn't say anything to him, he is just there, and then he leaves. Since we have moved in, the windows in his room have always looked foggy and dirty. Cleaning them doesn't help either. That is the only room in the house that is like that. I also have to check his air conditioning vent often, because it keeps closing.

My husband says that he sometimes feels like their is a presence in the room with him when no one else is home. He did say that it doesn't feel evil or bad, just feels weird, like someone is watching him.

My cat, who I have had for many years won't come in the house anymore. She has always been an inside cat, but I would let her out from time to time to play. Now she stays outside.

I keep talking to my son about it, as I don't want him to be afraid. I don't want him to think that we don't believe him either. If there is ever an event where I feel anyone in my house is in danger, we will leave. For now things are calm, but as my son tells us more and more, I am afraid that we will notice more and more things that we may have been closed minded to before.

My own childhood as well as my mother's, and her mother's was riddled with ghost stories, and strange happenings. Maybe one day I will find the time to type them out here for everyone to read.

It makes me wonder how many children go through things like this and are discounted by their parents. I also wonder what it is that makes these children ""grow out if it""? If anyone has any suggestions or comments on different methods of dealing with this issue please share.

The Neighbors Ghost,"Louisiana, United States",Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: The Neighbors Ghost

M y neighbor and me were very close friends and we did a lot of things together. When she moved I was pretty sad because she was my best friend, but I still have my sister, brother and my parents. One day, on saturday morning I started hearing strange noises from the house like... you know when you drop glass and it breaks? It sounds a lot like that, and also I hear growling (not dog growling) but sort of strange growling. I also hear stuff like running, stomping and regular walking in the house. I totally got freaked out and looked out my window and I saw a pale face with green eyes and reddish brownish hair.

I stepped back from the window and called the police. When the police knocked on the door I asked them what happened and they said that they checked through out the whole house and no one was there. Just telling you I don't think if they were real people they could have left that fast because right when I saw the face, there's no waiting, I called 911 immediately.

But after that I did some research about the house and it said that the house used to be a mansion built in 1587. And that a young girl named Angilina hung herself in the bathroom. And yes I have gone inside the house before the room I saw her face in was definitely the bathroom. I have no clue what's going on but I really think she's stalking my house because sometimes when I look out the window she's just looking at me. And my neighbor (my friend before she moved) did not tell me anything about a ghost in her home.

Do you think you can tell me what to do so I won't have to worry?

My Great Grandmother,"Texas, United States",Family / Friends Visits,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Family / Friends Visits :: My Great Grandmother

I was a young kid when I came into contact with my great grandmother. My parents moved into my grandparents home when my grandparents retired to the coast of Texas. Before they moved my grandmother sat my sister and I down and explained how our great grandmother had died in the house and still lived there. We thought she was crazy until one night...

I was throwing a temper tantrum in my bedroom because I hated living in the house. In each of the bedrooms, there was a Tiffany-style lamp that hung above each bed. I was sitting on the edge of the bed, throwing a fit and my father was next to me consoling me. I said, ""I hate this house. I hate this house. I hate this house..."" As I finished saying it a third time, the lamp above the bed swung backward, then forward and then came out of the ceiling and hit me in the back of the head. My father turned to me and said, ""See? You're pissing her off and you shouldn't piss her off...""

We moved shortly after that. I'd like to add that other things occurred in the house besides that experience. We would be watching TV and it would shut off all of a sudden. We would have to get up and actually switch it back on by pulling the knob that was used to turn it on and off.

My sister would take a shower and put her jewelry in the bathroom counter. Nearly every time she did it, she would come out of the shower to find her jewelry in a pile at the bottom of the stairs.

Other people claimed to have seen her standing in our dining room. Other family members claimed to hear breaking dishes upstairs and when they investigated, they found nothing. There was a consistent cold spot at the end of my sister's bed. We had a room in the house that we called, ""The East Room..."" No one went in there. You could FEEL something or someone... Some sort of presence there.

All in all, I was a skeptic until my experience. Now, I firmly believe in the afterlife, ghosts, etc.

Something Evil in this House,"Arizona, United States",,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Something Evil in this House

I t's me, Leslie, again with another scary experience from my dad's house. I know I told you that I would never spend another night at my father's house , but I never been more wrong. It was last Thursday September 6, of this year when my dad got sick, where we needed to help out with the cleaning, cooking, and so on. Well, I and my husband Alex, were getting ready for bed, I took a sleeping pill, so that I could get a good night sleep, so I thought.

It was exactly 3:12 a.m. when I got up gasping for air! I sat up in bed and called for Alex, who was already awake, he asked me, ""what's wrong?"", and I said I feel like the house is on fire. He said to me, yeah, it smells like smoke, wood burning. We jumped out of bed thinking the house was on fire. My father has a fireplace in the living room, but everything turned out to be okay.

We went back to bed talking what had just happened to us, we both felt like the room we were in was covered in smoke, it was very hard to breathe, like if the air had been sucked out! A little while later, we were calmed down enough to lay back down and try to get some sleep. Alex, having to go the bathroom, got up and went out the door, about a second later, Alex came in as white as a ghost, and was saying, there is somebody in your brother's room, they are talking, and cursing, and when he went to the door, everything stopped, no voices, nothing. He started back down the hallway to my room, where we were sleeping. If you remember, my brother was the one who would play with a ouija board quite often when he was younger, as Alex walked away from my brother's door, he was saying to himself ""It's only my imagination, I don't believe in this stuff"", and just then, he said he felt something grab his shoulder and push him towards my bedroom, where he screamed and yelled ""something's after me, something is after me!""

By then, we all got up and wanted to know what was going on, as we were explaining to my dad about smelling the smoke and not being able to breathe, and hearing the voices. He looked at us and to my shocking surprise, said there is something evil in this house! My jaw dropped because for the longest time I have seen, felt, heard things that can't be explained, my dad always denied, or never really listened to any of it, til' now!

My dad said that not long before, things, weird things were happening, like the t.v. Going on and off by itself, the bathroom sink would turn on, he said he could hear like there was pots and pans being thrown around, and when he would go see what it was, nothing seemed to be out of place, and then he said one morning, when he went to the bathroom, which you have to pass my brother's room first, when he heard somebody calling his name, Pete, they would say and the reason I'm saying ""they"", is because my dad said there was more than one voice calling to him. He then started to walk towards my brother's room, the voices were getting louder and louder. He stopped in front of the door, and said ""who is in here, I have a gun, so you better come out!"" After a pause, he began to open the door, when he said it wouldn't open, he pushed it with all his might the door swung open, and the most awful smell in the world came out! He said it smelled like something rotten and dead, and has he reached for the light to turn on, the light bulb blew, no light! My dad at that point said he closed the door and to himself started to pray, he said he had never felt like this ever, scared and confused about the whole thing.

One of you readers said that my brother must of opened a portal if you will, from the ouija board, letting all sorts of lost souls to travel in and around our home. My dad has let a person of the church who we have known all of our lives, to go see if they could ""cleanse"" the house, but needless to say, I think that it will not work, and that we will continue to endure these supernatural events. I just hope in the long run, something could be done to lead them to heaven and to stop believing that ""they"" are still living among us, when in fact they are dead!

Who Is the Little Girl?,Cyprus,Ouija Board / Seances,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Ouija Board / Seances :: Who Is the Little Girl?

T his is a story about my friend Natalie. When she was about 15 she and her friends used a Ouija board in her sister's apartment and they tried to call upon a Russian writer. Everything was going well until the moment they asked him to leave... He kept refusing, kept spelling out ""niet"" which is the russian word for ""no"". After many tries he left. That night he appeared in Natalie's mums' dream and told her to tell Natalie to never call upon him again because he could harm her. So Natalie's mother told her but she didn't listen and she and her friends went ahead and called him another 2 times. So in total 3. Nothing bad happened after that, but every time someone would be in that apartment they wouldn't feel right so they'd leave and never come back, eventually her sister moved out too. Until 6 months ago...

My friend Natalie was cleaning the dirty apartment because her sister wanted to move back in... She was in the kitchen cleaning when she turned around and underneath the table she saw a little girl of about 5 years old holding her knees into her arms on the floor staring at her. She had long black hair, she was dirty, and she looked very scared. Natalie turned around and back again and the little girl was gone. Soon after she started hearing noises coming from the stove. She left the house and never went back. Two weeks ago thought, while sleeping with her boyfriend she woke up and asked him to switch sides because she could feel the little girl trying to get up on her bed, she could actually feel the covers move, she was very frightened and now she doesn't know what to do.

She feels her so often now. Who is she, and why did she follow her home? Is she trapped here from the Ouija board time? It's been 8 years now... Any ideas people?

The Unexpected Encounter,United Kingdom,Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: The Unexpected Encounter

O nce upon a time, I had an after school job at the local hotel, where my mother was the day chef. I was the night cook and enjoyed working in the old building that had been built before 900. The hotel had been an inn in the days when Richard the third had been in nearby Gloucester town. And it was considered old then!

I had heard tales of other girls from my year at school who had gone to work there and had fled screaming from the building because of ""the ghosts"". I was never a girly girl, and to this day it takes a lot to convince me of anything I haven't seen and felt myself. So... the evening shift held no great fear for me.

The kitchen was -and is- at the back of the building and the floor is made of cobblestones and flagstones, cool in summer and downright freezing in the winter. From the first kitchen, you have to go through four separate and windowless rooms to the far larder... And then turn round and come back out again because there is no other way out. This is important to know and to remember when you think you've seen the landlady go down to the far larder for the meat and you don't see her come back again! This happened more than once.

Some of the stuff that happened was quite funny. Ann -a girl who worked with me- was drying cutlery one night and I was preparing vegetables for the next day. We were called to the kitchen door (the only door remember), and when we turned back to the table... All my vegetables had gone. Carrots and leeks and onions and spuds. All the peelings were still on the table though. Ann and I searched the larders and the china store, but no vegetables I had to do it all again. Ann was crying with laughter as I was shouting to mid-air, ""Thank you so very very much! Psychic onions is about all we need around here!""

For months over the Autumn and winter, Ann and I continued to work there without any great upsets, although a couple of the Saturday girls flew past us on the Christmas Eve when all the oven doors were opening and closing and the lights kept flashing on and off. In the Spring, though, things seemed to escalate a bit and all the new workers were having a lot of bother. The toilet light would go off and the flush would keep going and going.

The best sighting I personally had was when I worked on the day shift one day. They'd got a wedding on and I was to help in the kitchen and wait on if needed in the dining room.

We'd run out of Paprika and I got sent to buy some in the town. When I got back, I was told to go upstairs to the dining room. I'd still got the paprika in my hand and was climbing the stairs thinking what a glorious sunny day it was, with the sun coming through the big window and shining on the whole staircase. One of the barmaids called me when I was about halfway up and I turned back to answer her. While we were talking, a huge beautiful soft furred dog pushed past me on the staircase. ""was I in your way there?"", I asked it and Maureen and I laughed... That is, until it got to the foot of the stairs and disappeared, quite literally in front of our eyes. There was nowhere it could have gone. We were in bright sunlight. And, I had FELT it push me out of its way.

So there you go... Just one of the many sighting we had in the year or so I worked there.

New Office,"Nebraska, United States",Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: New Office

N o matter where I go, what I do, strange (maybe paranormal) things happen. I have posted a couple of other stories , those are of past accounts of some of the major occurrences I have experienced and I feel that this site is a perfect format to share these happenings.

My office has just over than doubled itself. It took over 2 years and a lot of renovation, remodeling and construction. Now we are all trying to settle in and get comfortable. By doubling its size, new ground was broke of course. The existing structure added one to forming a whole. To my knowledge, the land added on to at one time had homes on it. These homes have long since been taken down.

I have office in the older section of the building now, actually not far from where my previous office was, however, now instead of sharing an office, I have a private one (yep, a small promotion along with it, thank goodness). Over the last couple weeks settling into my new office has been very exciting, interesting and frustrating. The business does not stop day to day to let you settle in, the main reason I am here on a Saturday.

Over the last couple of days, very strange occurrences have been taking place in this portion of my building. Yesterday, I left a soda on my desk and went to a meeting, when I returned (no one in this wing of the building at the time and my office was locked) the lid was replaced on the soda and it had moved to another file cabinet across the room.

This morning, I sat at my computer to catch up on correspondence; I felt two taps on my shoulder. I have my back to the wall, the door is closed and I am the only one in here! This has happened 7 times in the last 2 weeks! Generally a few minutes after the taps on my shoulder, I hear whispering, 2 to 3 different voices, at least one male. Almost as if in conversation.

Now as I look up across my office. It is rather large, 2 of the ceiling tiles are moved! They were not that way when I came in this morning!

I am not sure what to do. I have never dealt with these things actually in my office and I am not sure how to respond or react. I am certain the people I work with would probably want to see me committed if I brought this up, and I can not reach the ceiling tiles to put them back into place.

My First Apartment Alone,"Tennessee, United States",Poltergeists / Physical Manifestations,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Poltergeists / Physical Manifestations :: My First Apartment Alone

A s most stories start out ""on a dark and stormy night"", I will bypass the horror formalities and just tell you exactly what happened. I had been living in Memphis TN for over a year, and at this time was living with a good friend of mine named Kari in an apartment complex in East Memphis. We got along fine, and greatly enjoyed living together, but due to the scorn of her local bishop, she was told that one of us had to move.

Seeing as how she had more furniture than I did, I decided to go and let her stay in the apartment. Mid-September I began looking for an apartment in the midtown area. Midtown is the artsy part of town where the bohemian ""wanna be's"", and young hippy art students live. LONG STORY SHORT, I found an apartment on the top floor of the ALTA VISTA complex on Poplar and Clark that fit into my price range. I moved out of the East Memphis apartment, and settled in to my new place.

This was my first time living completely alone. I had always had a roommate before, and I didn't know how I would handle the situation. But, as luck would have it after a few weeks I started getting comfortable with my new surroundings and started going out at night in the neighborhood to the local bars and clubs. Midtown life seemed to agree with me. I had made several new friends that came over frequently, so I spent very little time alone.

However, the night everything started, no one but myself would be witness to. It all began on a Saturday in October. I was lying on the couch watching television with my dog Cameron. He was a beautiful black lab I had adopted shortly after moving into Alta Vista. We were relaxing on the couch when I began to hear scratching inside the walls. This building was built in 1912 and although I had never seen any, I knew it had to play host to a variety of bugs and mice. I naturally assumed that's where the noises came from. And, I would have been satisfied with that theory if the situation had not suddenly exploded as it did.

Around 11:00pm I decided it was time for a shower before I proceeded with the evening's activities. I went to the bathroom, started the water running, removed my clothes and stepped inside the tub. That's when the scratching in the walls stopped and something started banging at the front door. I bolted from the tub and wrapped myself in a towel as I walked into the living room. ""Who is it?"" I called, but no one returned with an answer. Suddenly in front of my eyes the banging started again. It almost took my breath away. Whoever was on the other side of that door was banging with such force that it was shaking the door inside its frame. It was obvious that whoever was on the outside wanted in, and I was not about to give them permission.

""Who is it?"" I yelled over and over. ""I am not opening the door until you tell me who you are..."" And, then the banging stopped. Seeing as how I lived on the third floor of the apartment building I looked out the window at the courtyard to see who was coming out of the stairwell. I waited for several minutes before realizing that whoever it was stayed in the hall. They did not leave. I jerked the door open and looked down the stairs. Still, no one. There was nobody in the stairwell at all. ""How strange..."" I closed the door and went back inside and called my mom to tell her what had happened, and for the rest of the night everything stayed quiet.

HOWEVER, every other night after that was interrupted with the loud pounding at the door. This was something I complained about frequently to the office, but being unable to identify the guilty person; my complaints went seemingly unnoticed. (FAST FORWARD TO LATE OCTOBER) By this time the pounding was a frequent occurrence being that it happened almost every night, but the only difference was now I had friends who had witnessed it firsthand.

One night before the situation worsened, I happened to be in the bathroom again brushing my teeth when the knocks started. I turned and looked down the hallway and could see the door being beaten so roughly that it looked as if it were about to come down from its frame. It had never been this bad before. It was always loud, don't get me wrong, but never to this point of pounding and shaking. I walked down the hallway toward the front room when out of the corner of my eye I saw a plaster figure that I had hung beside my bedroom door fly from the spot it was hanging and hit the wall opposite it. I was stunned. I could not move. I could not believe what had just happened. It came off the wall with such force that it broke a few of the pieces off when it hit the wall across from it. And again, just as before, the banging stopped. My first instinct was ""get out, move, find a new place!"" But, I was under a six month lease and would be charged a fine plus they would keep my deposit, and I planned on getting that money back one day. So I stayed.

After October had passed, I went to the supermarket to pick up some pumpkins for decoration in honor of Thanksgiving. I bought 5 of the big perfect gords and lined them up on the tops of my china cabinets. I went home for Thanksgiving. Cameron and I piled up into the car and took off to momma's house for the holiday. It was great. No banging, pounding, or flying objects. I came back home on a Monday.

I came into the apartment and threw my bag down. I went down the hallway to the bathroom to use the restroom. After I finished I emerged out of the bathroom and discovered that I had left my kitchen door shut. I turned the knob and pushed. Something was behind the door. I pushed again, and something was definitely on the other side of the door blocking me from opening it. I PUSHED HARD! And, got it open. I looked behind the door and discovered one of the pumpkins that I had placed on my china cabinets had been hurled at the back of the door. You could see where it had hit, where the guts has splashed out, and where it slid down on to the floor. I panicked as I looked around the room. I saw that all my pumpkins were lying in the floor. HOW COULD THIS HAPPEN? No one had a key. There were no signs of forced entry. I felt like I was losing my mind.

Well, sad to say after this huge ordeal, I did wind up breaking my lease and letting them keep my deposit. I never slept in the apt again.

PS: I forgot to tell you about the pantry. You see, I didn't have air conditioning in that apt and it got very hot in the late summer, but I had discovered that the pantry in the kitchen was ALWAYS cold as ice FOR SOME UNKNOWN REASON. So when I would wake up sweating at night I would take go stand in the pantry. ALSO, I caught the dog staring at it on several occasions and growling. The whole situation just creeps me out.

Demonic Slumber Party,"Tennessee, United States",Demons / Possessions / Exorcisms,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Demons / Possessions / Exorcisms :: Demonic Slumber Party

T he story takes place right outside of Millington Tennessee. At the time, I was twelve years old, and this was my very first encounter. My best friend was going to have a slumber party to celebrate her 12th birthday. She invited me and two other girls, and I was the eldest by a few months. We arrived in the same car, and the party started at about seven o'clock p.m. We started by eating cake, and attempting to play Clue.

Then, we attempted to play twister, and her mother went to bed. Her older brother was spending the night at his friends house about twenty miles away. Her mother told us to go to my friend's room, so we did. One of her other friends told us a ghost story, and then my friend did something I regret to this day. She told us about her ""imaginary"" friend, and I knew that she was only trying to scare the other girls.

She said that her ""friend"" showed up at midnight and left at one o'clock a.m. Then at midnight, it came. It started with me telling them I could tell when bad things were going to happen, and that I had seen a warning. They all got scared, but we were thirsty so they went to the kitchen to get some drinks. Well, when I got half way down the hall, I remembered that I forgot something in the room and went back to get it.

When I came down the hall, I felt like I was being choked. I was literally unable to breathe. The two other girls were looking at me and saw my face turning blue, my friend was looking down the hall. When I saw the look on her face, I turned around still gasping for air and crying. I still remember the creature to this day. It was in her brother's room, staring at me with red eyes. It was like a shadow, but it was tall and had large bat wings.

I turned away and I started being able to breathe again, but when I looked at the room again the creature was gone. We all ran back to the room, shut, locked, and put a chair under the door! Thirty minutes later, we heard some one walking down the hall and we called out my friend's mother's name. No one answered, so we called out again, still no answer. Then, the doorknob jiggled. We all huddled together on my friend's bed. We never heard footsteps leave.

Sure enough, at one o'clock a.m. the presence was completely gone. Just to be sure, we didn't sleep at all.

My Life,"Wisconsin, United States",Family / Friends Visits,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Family / Friends Visits :: My Life

T o all who read this. This is my story of what happens on a daily basis in my home, work or where ever I go. The focus here, is to show you what goes on in my home. Now, please keep in mind, my home is not haunted. It was in May of 06.

I was home alone. The kids were at school and my husband was at work. I had all my windows open while I was cleaning, just to get that extra fresh air smell in my house. As I was walking through the kitchen, to the formal dining room, someone started banging on my cabinets. I turned around so fast, because it startled me. Right away I knew it was my Aunt Sharon who passed away in the summer of 2005. I yelled at her saying ""Aunt Sharon, don't you scare me. Now stop it!"" At that point I grabbed my cell phone and went down stairs in the washroom to call my husband and tell him what just happened. (I tell him everything)

While I was walking into the family room on the lower level, I turned on the lights to see and as my husband picked up on the other line, the lights started going on and off. I was freaked. Even though I knew who it was, it caught me off guard. As my husband said hello to me, I screamed at my Aunt Sharon, telling her it was not funny and to never scare me like that again. To this day, she has not done that. I welcome her in my home. She just has to behave herself. I have so many stories of what goes on. Some scary, some very funny. If you enjoyed my little short story, please leave a message or email me. I will be more than happy to talk to you.

Upset Spirit,"Illinois, United States",Old Hags / Night Attacks / Sleep Paralysis,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Old Hags / Night Attacks / Sleep Paralysis :: Upset Spirit

W hen I was sixteen years old, I told my grandmother that when I reach the age of 18, I was going to change my name. I was named after her and my aunt. I did not know that I had hurt her feelings. I just did not like my name and wanted something more common like a lot of my friends names were. I was so adamant about the change that I had a few of the names picked out for that special occasion.

My grandmother believed in ghosts. She would tell me and my sister ghosts stories about her experiences as well as her siblings and friends. They were really scary. I would listen for hours and hours. She was a very good story teller.

Well back to the story. After my granny told her ghosts stories, I laid down for the night. I got a scary feeling and I kind of put my head under the bed covers. Suddenly, something or someone grabbed my head and pushed down on my head so hard I could not move and could hardly breathe. I tried for a few seconds to pull the covers off my head but could not. The pain was really severe. I was about to scream out for my grandmother and the pressure of the hold on my head let go. I jerked the covers down and saw no one. I know it could not have been a live person because I would have seen them running away or standing there besides the bed. That gave me the oddest feeling and I was very much afraid. I jumped out of the bed and climbed to the top of my grandmother's bed and finally fell asleep. I told her about it the next morning and she just smiled at me.

It was a long time before I spent the night again and I never mentioned anything else about changing my name and that pressure never happened again.

My Uncle Was Possessed,"Massachusetts, United States",Demons / Possessions / Exorcisms,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Demons / Possessions / Exorcisms :: My Uncle Was Possessed

H ey everyone it's me again, and I'm going to tell you about the freakiest thing that happened to my uncle. My cousin just won a soccer game and my uncle wanted to celebrate with ice cream, so when we were walking down the sidewalk my uncle just suddenly stopped and his eyes turned kind of black and lifeless. It scared the shiznit out of me! (I might mention that this was at 10:00pm) So I was just about to ask him what was wrong when he started to stare at me with this evil look and said ""let's not get ice cream anymore"" my cousin gave me a disappointing look and grabbed my hand and we walked back home.

On the way back, my cousin and I heard my uncle muttering nonsense to himself in a language that kind of sounded like German. We got so scared, we didn't even want to talk to him anymore. Then, he turned around wicked fast as if he knew what me and my cousin were thinking. My cousin didn't want to look into his eyes because they were really frightening. My uncle said in a voice that WAS NOT his own: ""Satan is here! He will take me tonight"".

My cousin tugged on my t-shirt and we both bolted down the street like rockets. When I looked back to see if my uncle was chasing us, I saw him going crazy and hitting himself in the head, then I didn't want to look back because I was thinking to myself ""what the hell?""

If anything like this has happened to you or your family please tell me what I should do because it seems like it's happening more often.

Harassed by an Evil Entity,"Iowa, United States",Old Hags / Night Attacks / Sleep Paralysis,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Old Hags / Night Attacks / Sleep Paralysis :: Harassed by an Evil Entity

L ast night I was up late, I didn't get to bed until about 1 in the morning. I was lying in bed and thinking to myself a lot about life and I heard an unfamiliar voice in my head but dismissed it to being so tired and thinking so much. This voice as I recall, came along with a fluttering noise and seemed to be copying everything I was thinking.

After a few more minutes, about 1:15, I started to dose off. I had my eyes closed and saw an image of a bald evil looking monk in a brown robe, and it startled me awake, this was about 1:45. I knew I was completely awake but couldn't move at all. It seemed like the entire room was filled with a loud hum or rumble, my ears were ringing, and I heard something that sounded like some ""thing"" screeching, it was pitch black and my entire body got extremely hot.

I tried with all my might to move my hand to my necklace of the Saint Mary, and when I finally reached it, I started reciting the lord's prayer over and over in my head, and after a few minutes the noise went away and I felt the pressure release from my body. I sat up and my entire body was tingling. I got up immediately and went to my mom's room because I was so freaked out.

I was sleeping in my parents' room and it was about an hour and a half later, I once again woke up startled, and I know I was wide awake but once again, I could not move. I thought ""Why are you doing this to me? STOP!"" and after a few seconds, the sound went away and I could move, but once again felt the tingle all over my body. I tried to go back to sleep but every time I was just about to dose off and my eyes would close, I saw a flash of a scary image that would startle me awake, and I didn't get any sleep after that.

I'm kind of afraid to see how tonight goes, hopefully it is better and I can sleep undisturbed, I will be back and comment on how it goes. Thanks for your interest. Sleep Well. Just for reference, my sleepless night was early morning September 19th.

A Haunting Bath,"Montana, United States",Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: A Haunting Bath

T he story takes place in the Northern Rockies of Western Montana. The house I lived in was a 1880s western Victorian that one housed miners for the Anaconda company. The day I walked into this house, the first time I could feel a warm embrace that I had not felt before or since. So on that day I made the offer and it was accepted.

The house would give me glimpses of a hidden world from time to time. The first few were haunting violin music from an empty upstairs room very late at night. There were also many nights I would see things, shapes, shadows and a mist of sorts. Though the true contact of this entity happened on a brisk autumn eve after returning home from a long day at work. I had no shower in this old home so I bathed in a period claw foot tub. I ran the tub like any other time, hopped in and lathered up. The water was a bit to warm for my liking so with soap all over me and my eyes shut I reached for the cold water side and turned it, to my surprise I had turned the hot water on full blast, feverishly trying to get the soap out of my eyes to remedy the water situation. I opened one eye in time to watch the hot water turn off with out any help from me.

I remember every experience that home had to show me with a fondness and hope that one day I would return and thank it for opening my already very open eyes.

Brujaria and Disappearing Act,"Michigan, United States",Pets / Animals,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Pets / Animals :: Brujaria and Disappearing Act

T his is story that I can very vividly remember. When I was a young child we would often take trips out of state and visit family. I always had a blast because I would be able to play with all my cousins and visit with family I hadn't seen in a long time. One particular trip we took was to Michigan and well this trip wasn't a good trip because of the circumstances that we had to go on.

See, my mother had an aunt that, well, not to many of the people in my family spoke of for various reasons, but mainly because she liked to dabble in black magic or witchcraft or like my mami would say, ""brujaria..."" Well needless to say she wasn't very popular in the family but seeing that she was family, we had to go and pay our respects to her. Now we arrived to Michigan and of course needed a place to stay and all that was available at that time was my mom's aunt's house. Which had only 2 bedrooms and one of the 2 bedrooms was occupied by her grandson who lived with her.

So of course my brother and I along with my parents shared the aunt's room. Now things were fine up until the point when my younger brother and I had to go to bed, and being ""active"" kids we didn't want to sleep and tried to find any excuse not to sleep that night. As we laid there we played various games, like I spy, but this game of I spy was a little different. It was my brother's turn and well he said I spy something black, I spy something black with yellow eyes, I spy something black with yellow eyes and purrs and of course I said a CAT! Then tried looking around for this cat my brother spied and there it was, at the top of the bed looking down at us on the floor.

So my brother and I started to play with the cat until we made so much noise that my mom came in to scold us. Of course we told her it was a cat that we were playing with when she questioned why we weren't asleep and then she replied there was no cat at the house and we needed to go to sleep. As soon as she walked out, we heard my mom's cousin tell her that there was a cat at the house at one point but that it died a few years earlier and proceeded to tell my mom that after the cat died, her aunt Trini used some of her ""magic"" and casted a spell for the cat to come back and protect the house and her. My mom in return said to her cousin that it was best that it be kept from us.

Later that night, based of what my mom told me years later, my mom and her cousin stayed up catching up on old times when my mom seen that cat coming down the stairs. She said it started at the top of the stairs and worked his way down very slowly down, that was nothing out of the norm until my mom seen the cat come down the stairs and change shape into a man. She said she seen the cat change shape going down the stairs, then chang shape back going up it. When she questioned her cousin again about the cat, he cousin replied that's the cat that my grandmother brought back but that she intentionally casted a spell where the cat would be able to shape into a man so no one would be suspicious when seen talking to a man other than a cat.

The rest of the time we were there we experienced a number of different things. We would see the image of my aunt Trini in mirrors we would pass, hear people talking in her room when no one was in there, see the cat sit and stare at us and his eyes change color. Without mention after we left that house we never returned to stay again there. My mom's cousin tried selling the house some years later but ended up not being able to sell it for some ""faulty"" reason or another when people would come to tour it. People said they would feel some rooms really cold, colder then others and would feel as if someone was watching them.

I know it maybe hard to believe but I think it was a way of aunt Trini trying to hold onto a place she held so close to her even after her death.

The Poolside Guardian,"Pennsylvania, United States",Misc,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Misc :: The Poolside Guardian

I know some of you out there have read some of my other stories . As this is my 4th story that I am sharing. I was reading a story on this site and it made me think of something that had happened to me as a child one summer at the local pool.

One day I was at the pool having a good time. I must've been around 10 or so. I was swimming in the 5ft section where I usually swam. I had eventually got out of the pool and climbed up onto the wall. Well the wall was made of cement and went around the whole pool of course. I had got up on the wall and was actually standing on it, which I guess was rather dumb because it was pretty high up to be standing on. The ground below, behind the wall, was of course made of cement also.

I'm standing on this wall talking to one of my friends who was still in the pool. All of a sudden, I lost my balance and started to fall backwards. As soon as I lost my balance I thought ""oh my god, I going to fall and crack my head open,"" and of course that's what probably should of happened from the height I was standing and the distance between the fall. I was like in mid-air and I remember a strange feeling of my body ""twisting"". Almost like it had shifted. And it felt like I was ""floating"" in the air and all of a sudden, I landed on my feet!

Let me tell you. I didn't think much about it that day. Except for the fact that I was glad I didn't crack my head open. But, let me tell you also, that I definitely should have. There was no way that I should not have gotten hurt standing at least 9 feet above the ground on a slippery cement wall with no shoes and slippery feet.

Something or someone was definitely watching out for me that day. I don't know who or what but I'm glad they were. If anyone out there is reading this, I definitely wouldn't mind some feedback on my story. Thanks for listening!

The Tiki Face Phantom,"North Carolina, United States",Old Hags / Night Attacks / Sleep Paralysis,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Old Hags / Night Attacks / Sleep Paralysis :: The Tiki Face Phantom

T his story is the second experience that I had that dealt with being visited and paralyzed in my sleep. The first one is It came as a familiar if you wish to go back and read it. The story begins with first a little background, then a ridiculous beginning. Just bear with me because it will get better.

It begins in the year 2000 in a house that I was renting in a little town called Icard. This place was gloomy to begin with but I lived there out of necessitation. People were sort of ""back woods"" so to speak and not very friendly. I remember the first day I walked through the house something just didn't seem right. But, I decided to take it anyway. (I later found out that the previous owner had died there in the living room). I would often hear faint whispers and see things out of the corner of my eye. I would also find myself sliding the shower door open to see if someone was watching me because it felt like that at all times.

Here's were the ridiculous part begins. I had became some what addicted to a video game called CTR (crash team racing) on my play station. To this day it remains one of my absolute favorites. In this game it contains different icons. One of which is that of a tiki statue that can be good or evil. So, one night I came home after being out with some friends and pretty much went straight to bed. I hadn't laid there but a few minutes when I had this terrible feeling that I was not alone. This time I was lying on my back and I slowly open my eyes out of dread. What I then saw was a large black swirling mass in the upper left hand corner above the door of my room. Then, out of the center of it appeared the evil tiki face statue. It was bright red and orange. The image then disappeared but the blob remained.

As I lay motionless it started a slow dissent down the door. And I knew that it was coming for me but I laid stock still not knowing what to expect. I could clearly see it as it crept across the floor coming towards towards me (getting goose bumps just writing this). When it reached the side of my bed it sank as if to be out of view. My heart was beating out of my chest and I remember thinking ""oh no not again"". I knew in my mind that it was coming under the covers and sure enough, I felt them move. It had reached under in order to make contact with my skin ever so slowly. The instant I felt it's icy finger touch my left arm it was if it had stuck an electric cord to me. I was literally being shocked.

Then it spoke and said, ""just one more time"". Which to this day baffles me. My body was jolting from head to toe. Then from out of no where I thought ""GOD PLEASE HELP ME!"". And just like that immediately stopped. I got up to turn the light on and noticed that it was cold in the room.

Shortly there after my next door neighbor showed up on my door step ""witnessing"" to me. What that means is a person who feels that God has put it on their mind and heart to tell you about your sins in order to save your soul. Not ever really being involved in church I didn't have a clue as to what he was saying and I found him offensive. As it turned out I started dating a person who was in church and got me to go with her on a regular basis where upon eventually I was indeed saved and understood what the neighbor was trying to tell me. God creates paths that leads to him. I guess that was one of mine.

I have many other experiences that I will write about as time allows. Even one that has to do with the girl that was mentioned. And, I moved out of that house a couple of months later. I remember the day I moved out a cabinet door in the kitchen had slammed shut by itself as if something was telling me goodbye.

Mom's Jewelry Box,Canada,Family / Friends Visits,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Family / Friends Visits :: Mom's Jewelry Box

M y mother died November 10th 2005. I've always believed in ghosts, I've never seen one but I have had many things happen to me that would involve a ghost. After my mother died, november 10th, my grandpa gave me her jewelry box so I put it in my room. Before I went to bed the jewelry box started playing by itself so I got up and looked at the back and the button or whatever it's called wasn't turning, I started to get scared since the jewelry box doesn't play without someone opening the top.

I thought that it wouldn't happen again, but I was wrong. February 3rd is my mother's birthday, again that day before going to bed the jewelry box started playing by itself, same thing happened as the first time, the button wasn't turning behind and the top wasn't opened. That time I was surprised because it had happened 2 times on 2 ""special"" days.

On mothers day, I was again sitting in my room, and before I went to bed it started playing again, that time I was freaked out. It had happen 3 times the same year and on 3 special days... The day she died, the day of her birthday and mothers day.

I can't explain what happened but I do think that it's a sign that she's watching over me. Since november 10th 2005 every 3 special occasions mom's jewelry box plays me a melody...

The Ghost Who Woke Me from my Nightmare,"Kansas, United States",Apparitions / Voices / Touches,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Apparitions / Voices / Touches :: The Ghost Who Woke Me from my Nightmare

W hen I was seventeen I lived in rural Kansas near one of the Civil War battlefields. Throughout my childhood, I had been plagued with ghostly visits and nightmares of drowning in a river. One night I was having an awful nightmare. This one was particularly disturbing because I kept seeing myself dead in bloody water in a bathtub. I could smell death and I was consumed by fear, because this seemed all too real. Just then, I was gently ""shaken"" awake. When I awoke, I sat up in bed, relieved that I was still alive. No one was there. I shook it off and went back to sleep.

A while later, I continued to have this ominous dream, only this time I saw my body laying in a bathtub full of blood in my grandparents' bathroom (their house was just down the road from me). Again, I was awaken from the horrific scenario in the same gentle, yet urgent manner, but there was no one there.

At this time, I thought I had merely been imagining the feeling of being shaken awake, but I was too tired to contemplate it, so I went back to sleep. Once again, I resumed the torment of dreaming of my own death in a bloody bathtub. This time the dream had a change of location to my ex-boyfriend's bathroom. There were demons present in the dream this time. I became really frightened and found myself in his upstairs bedroom, I imagine to seek consoling from him. After scanning the room, I found that he was not there. However, I did stay long enough to take note that he had re-arranged his room. It was rather tidy and I noticed his drawing board was in a different location, prepped with notebook paper that had safety pins in each corner of the paper.

For the last time, someone woke me up, this time with an even more urgency. As soon as I opened my eyes, there was an attractive young man hovering parallel to my body about two feet above me. I froze. He was glowing, white with well defined features, but he had no body, only a ""fading"" torso. He was looking at me really intensely and his mouth was moving in an obvious attempt to communicate with me, as if he was trying desperately to give me a message beyond the grave. My heart was pounding and when I was finally able to move out of my frozen state after what seemed like at least a minute, I rolled off the bed and ran into my mother's room. After relaying the fantastically horrifying experience to her, she just said, ""Aimee, go back to bed!"".

I did not return to my room that night, needless to say. I slept in my six year-old brother's room, instead.

The story does not end there. The next morning I had play practice at school. During the break, my female cast members and I went to the girls' room to freshen up. While I was washing my hands, a rather obnoxious girl came bolting into the bathroom hysterically shouting , ""I seen a ghost, I seen a ghost!"" She said that it was down the hallway from the theatre and identified the apparition as being a young male. I think I turned white. I did not utter a word to anyone about my ghostly visit the night before.

Quickly, I exited the girls' room and went to the commons' area to make a quick phone call to my ex-boyfriend to make sure he was still alive. We had not spoken to nor seen each other for two weeks, and I was a little worried at this point that he might be deceased. The ghostly man in my room had resembled my ex-beau, but I had not thought of the possibility that it actually could have been he who gave me the ether-worldly visit in the night.

I hastily shoved a quarter into the payphone and dialed his number. I was relieved to hear his voice when he answered. He was indeed still breathing and his blood was still pumping through his veins. I described the whole creepy incident to him, even the part about me visiting his room in the night. He remained silent, listening to my every word. When I was finished telling him everything, he said that he did clean his room and rearranged some things, as I had described them. Also he noted that his drawing board was where I had said it was in the dream, only there was drawing paper, not notebook paper, and paper clips in the corners of the board, not safety pins.

Now, in my thirties, I continue to have creepy nightmares to this day, and although I have heard and felt strange things, I have not physically seen an apparition since I was about nineteen. The mystery remains who the ghostly man was. My theory is that it was either a Civil war ghost who watched over the place, or an apparition who followed me home from one of the cemeteries I used to visit.

Papa,"Florida, United States",Family / Friends Visits,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Family / Friends Visits :: Papa

M y family has always had this problem. We can see and hear things that shouldn't be there. When I was very young my mom, sister, and myself lived in a small two bedroom house, it was always pretty creepy. At night I always had trouble falling asleep (I still do). Well later at night I would hear things, the fridge opening, foot steps in the hallway, weird things like that.

One night I got up to go to the bathroom and seen the fridge open, and no body there. I thought nothing of it and went about my business. Well through the time we lived there, things like this kept happening and as I got older I started to get freaked out, and one day I asked mom what it was, her response was ""it's just papa"". I was too young to remember papa, he passed when I was about 2. All of this happened until we moved when I was 12. I know papa was always watching over us because of all the other weird stuff that was happening at that house. His tool shed was pretty freaky, so much so I wouldn't go near it unless I absolutely had to. I have plenty of experiences to share about that and other things that happened when I was a kid. But hearing things is by far the scariest thing that happened to me there.

Great Grandma's Last Farewell ?,Germany,Family / Friends Visits,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Family / Friends Visits :: Great Grandma's Last Farewell ?

I was about 10 or 11 when this happened but I still remember it clearly as if it was yesterday... While our house was being renovated, we (my mom, my sister and I) were staying at our Mom's Parents house. My Great Grandma had died a few years earlier in that same room we were sleeping in. In the hallway we had one of those christmas bells hanging from one of the door handles. The night was absolutely windstill and all the doors were shut. It was 2:30 a.m. when that little bell suddenly started to ring very loudly. Normally my mom and my sister should have awoken by that noise. But no way. They said they didn't here a thing during that night.

When I told my mom what I had experienced during the night, she looked at me as if I were totally nuts. My sister also didn't believe me as she doesn't believe in ghosts or any supernatural happenings. Later I found out that my great Grandma had died at 2:30 a.m. Exactly 4 years earlier. Somehow I know it was her saying her last goodbye to me...

I have to say that we had been living in the U.S. And just returned after my parents had divorced. I wasn't there when my Great Grandma died but I had been close with her even though I was still so little.

Strange Singing at Pioneer Church,"California, United States",Ghost Hunting,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Ghost Hunting :: Strange Singing at Pioneer Church

M y fellow investigator Paul Roberts had his hunches about Sutters fort after getting ghost reports on his hotline, so we rambled around in the twilight looking for any sign of anomalous mischief. Much of the time was picking up EVP's then blushing when realizing it was only the ambient sounds of downtown Sacramento on Saturday evening.

A few instances tantalized us, but when Paul saw Pioneer church across the street he froze. And he turned to me rather solemnly and asked if I wanted to check it out. His reaction was surprising, he had just told me that he didn't think himself a psychic and yet here he was drawn by some unseen force, we ditched Sutter's fort without a second thought. Paint was chipping on the sides of the church showing its old age underneath. Historically speaking this is not an old site, less than 150 years old, but this church would have witnessed the hardness of life on the ""frontier"" and the cruelty of people, everything from crimes done on those with no-rights and for no reason at all, to public hangings at Sutters fort.

I stepped in its walking-labyrinth and realized this place had a sincerely eerie soulfulness. Paul was taking pictures, scratching his Journalist itch. I had been stuck to his side during the entire investigation and at that one moment had felt prompted to go to the threshold of the church. Being psychic is part of being human, I think, and so I was just going with the flow. The doors were locked, but tall and wide enough for host of Angels to gallop in. For awhile, I just stood there trying to block out the happenings of the evening and welcome any souls that desired my interface or who wanted to try out the microphone on the ""listen-up"".

I was just giving up when I looked at the door on the left, and decided that's where I should be. I stood quietly then heard Paul talking about the church as he walked up the steps to the threshold. In that same moment I heard something that sounded like a congregation singing from inside the church. After entertaining any number of reasons why that might happen and realizing all my rational explanations were mostly unreasonable, I just let myself be puzzled as I listened.

What I remember best is how long I heard the singing and how defined several of the voices were. Altos, baritones and sopranos, male and female, and they were all on key. I was so excited I whispered quietly to Paul that I was hearing something. I tried to tune back in, but couldn't hear anything after that. Disappointed, I was going to walk away. ""Let me try..."" so, I fitted the earphones in his ears and stood by curiously. Thinking I was going to be a distraction to him, I began to pull myself down the steps. ""Whoa! I heard a thud!"" He said. Then he said he heard a one-way conversation and a little boy's voice. Chills and goose bumps claimed me, and I huddled close, listening for anything. The last thing he said was that something was ""opened"". And that was enough. He pulled out his earplugs, raised his brows and smiled.

Later, I just couldn't believe how much activity we picked up there, it is certainly crying out for attention from the living, and a place that deserves time, and more permissiveness inside, to explore.

Who is Whispering my Name?,United Kingdom,Old Hags / Night Attacks / Sleep Paralysis,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Old Hags / Night Attacks / Sleep Paralysis :: Who is Whispering my Name?

A bout 3 months ago I was left to look after our house. One night I was alone, trying to go to sleep when something touched my shoulder I woke to a whisper ""helen"" and the door open and shut. After a few moments I stood and went to see if I could see anything, my dog was barking at the door so I let her out, nothing else happened.

Last night, 21st september, I was again trying to go to sleep, as I was drifting off, something hit my head quite hard, I woke, looked round and could see no one, I started to go cold, I tried 2 move my arm but I couldn't, I then tried to sit up I couldn't do that either, I began to go hot and I could feel my hear pounding and my arms pulsating, I tried to shout my mum but no noise would come out.

A few moments later I could move again, I ran into my mum's room but she was asleep so I went back into my room. I lay back down, I felt something hit my head again, this time I managed to shout my mum, she came in and asked what was wrong but nothing was happening, She told me I had been dreaming and to go back to sleep. This time I feel asleep but I woke again to see a black cloud float away from me.

I want to know who it is and what they want, I have asked my mum if I can see a medium but she said I'm being silly. I'm not worried or scared, I'd just like to know why me?

You're Not Crazy!,"New York, United States",Psychic / Medium,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Psychic / Medium :: You're Not Crazy!

I am pleased to hear that others are experiencing the same thing. My mother and I can see them very well. We have too many stories to possibly post, but the ones we see are in great numbers and everywhere. I would like to say that the story about the 7yr old boy in the new house with the antiques - seems very familiar. My mother's house is loaded with antiques and other people. They never really seem to be doing anything in particular, you can just see them, some are doing what they were doing before they died.

There are a lot of people from different time periods, some from 1920s-ish, some from the fifties, we have definitely come to the conclusion that they come with the furniture. Unfortunately upon moving into my mother's house and after our encounters there, we thought it would be a swell idea to play with a ouija board to see if we could figure out who these people were. Well needless to say, we did. Her house had been built in 1891 - so naturally there was a lot of activity from all the different people who lived there.

Eventually after having success with the board and talking to many different people we came up with a list of abbreviations of their names and and idea of what went on in the house years ago. We took the list of abbreviations to our Municipal Center which has the departments of deeds in it. As we back-track in the houses history we find the full names of the abbreviated deceased. Sure enough everyone of them were in the deed records all the way back to the house in 1891 when in was just land.

As for the 7yr old boy, I think they bother my kids like that as well. He plays with them and sometimes has to sleep with us because he won't go back to his bed. He is only 2 but he points at them and says things (baby gibberish) to me about them. I have no idea if this is good or bad, that we can see them, but I hope to find some kind of answers.

Footsteps and More,"Oklahoma, United States",Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: Footsteps and More

M y husband and I have 4 children. We moved into our 40 year old home (we think it is actually closer to 44 years old) last year. Since then, I have heard footsteps on the stairs (like a light weight adult's steps) when no one is up. (I will check... Everyone asleep). The steps seem to stop at the entryway of my bedroom, the master bedroom.

Sometimes when this happens my border collie will charge up the stairs, run into my room and hide her head in the corner. She usually isn't like this. I have heard this several times, with no one around, all still sleeping. I have been in bed and felt the covers ""pull down"" tight on one side of my body, yet no one is there to sit next to me. I turn over... No one there at all.

About a month or so ago, I went downstairs to let me dog outside. It was around 3:30 AM (this is when most of the activity happens). I let her out, left the back door a jar and went into the bathroom downstairs just a few feet a way from the dining room. The DR has ceramic tile flooring with 6 wooden chairs at the table. I heard three loud scraping noises... Someone scooting the chairs under the table. The noise is very distinctive as my kids do this all the time. I froze thinking someone had come in the house through the backdoor that I left open for our dog. I went into the DR, no one there... dog still outside. She would have normally barked and come back inside. Three chairs were pulled out from under the table.

About 2-3 weeks ago, I was sitting here at my PC and felt a hand rest on my ribs. I thought one of my kids came up behind me. No one was there. CLEARLY, someone put their hand on my ribs. Then, within a few minutes ""someone"" tapped on my shoulder... again, no kids, no one. (I went to check them... watching TV.) I have no idea what is going on.

I have been somewhat skeptical of ghosts but now am open to ANY suggests! Thank you so much. Also, it seems to be me that observe these things (one of my daughters did hear the footsteps on one occasion). I am not crazy. Just a mom to 4 kids, go to church Sunday school, etc. I had to put an AC unit in my room which helps to block out the footsteps.

Our Stay at Brookdale Lodge,"California, United States",Ghost Tours & Haunted Hotels,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Ghost Tours & Haunted Hotels :: Our Stay at Brookdale Lodge

E very September my husband and I go to San Francisco for a quiet get-away. This year September 2007 we cut our time short in the city to stay one night at the Lodge. I heard the stories about the Brookdale Lodge, but wanted to see for myself. Being completely open-minded and wanting to see the ""permanent visitors"" I felt we had a chance.

We checked in, went to our room (#22) to get settled and wait for the dining room to open at 5pm. (One of spots where at least two ""visitors"" have been viewed).

We were the first to be seated in the dining room. Nothing. I even took pictures in hopes of ""catching"" something... nothing. While the dining room looked a bit tired and past its prime, the food was wonderful! Very generous portions, nicely presented, so we had a great dinner with no ""visitors..."" I was terribly sad, but I guess it wasn't meant to be.

We went back to our room, turned the television on and watched news for a short while when we heard someone moving into the room right next to us. (With a seemingly empty parking lot... Why do they put people in rooms right next to each other?) We were getting a little concerned as our new neighbors were a bit too loud. Not their television, but conversation muffled and lots of walking around. My husband always travels with earplugs just for occasions like these (noisy hotel neighbors). He seemed to be okay for the evening we turned the lights off went to sleep.

We woke probably 3 hours later with our room being incredibly hot. The heater switch is off, no heat coming from the heating unit. We figured it was our downstairs neighbor's heater (you know, the theory heat rises). Our neighbors were still walking around but their talking stopped. We fell back asleep.

As we checked out the next morning, I inquired of our host if we had neighbors in the rooms on either side of us. The answer was no. The heat thing? Probably unlikely our room would become incredibly hot without the heating source being in the room.

My thoughts, we didn't see the ""permanent visitors"" but we heard them and I'm very pleased.

Two Spirits or One?,"Pennsylvania, United States",Family / Friends Visits,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Family / Friends Visits :: Two Spirits or One?

I was unnerved to move in with my fiance when he'd first brought up the idea, but not for typical reasoning. Before my fiance and I were engaged, I lived in my own apartment, in oakland (pittsburgh) and he lived in his grandmother's old house (penn hills, 20 minutes outside of pittsburgh). I had been there before, spent the night there before, but I really didn't care for the place. Granted it was a very nice house, big, comfortable, well preserved through the years, very richly decorated, I disliked it very much. And my distaste only grew stronger, not to sound cliche, when night time came, and all the lights went out.

I've never SEEN anything, but I get very bad feelings and hear very strange things. One night when I stayed over I heard someone walking around upstairs, when my sweetheart and I were both downstairs cuddling. There were times when I would walk through strange cold spots in the hallways or on the stairs, I always felt like someone was watching me hatefully, I would get shivers and goose bumps for absolutely no apparent reason, and at night the only time I felt safe was with mike (my fiance). There was also something I noticed, that scared me very much, in the upstairs bathroom. There was an odd kind of graining design on the back of the bathroom door, which was obviously made of natural wood. It could be a coincidence but the design looks like a pair of very menacing eyes, almost like a not fully developed face that's just very angry, it just looks evil and frightening.

One day I finally confronted mike about the house. I explained that it frightened me and told him about the graining on the door and odd things I had been noticing. He finally told me that he also believed the house was haunted. Apparently he had an experience in the same bathroom where the evil face is on the door. When he was a child, he told me, that once he was brushing his teeth and looking in the mirror, and he leaned down to spit and when he looked back into the mirror, his image was still brushing its teeth while he himself had stopped. Sounds crazy doesn't it? He's also claimed seeing strange images in mirrors throughout the house, he's very afraid of them and refuses to look at them after a certain time of day passes.

He also believed that the spirit of his grandfather was residing in the house still. His grandfather passed away years ago, and even after his death he carried on with old habits. Mike said his grandfathers favorite dog would run off of the porch and down to a spot where he used to sit and pet the dog, and would stay down there for quite some time before returning. Michael also told me that lights would turn on or off of their own accord in the garage, where his grandfather used to work. He believed his grandfathers spirit was a kind one, but we both believe there's a bad one there as well, one that we can't understand what it is or what it wants.

So imagine my surprise when mike took a nightshift job a week after I finally decided I would move in, and did move in. I know maybe I'm just being a big scaredy cat, and maybe these are all just really really well put together coincidences, but lately even worse things have been happening. Among the cold spots and strange noises, our kitchen has been acting crazy.

One night the light to the ceiling fan just exploded, and literally shattered glass everywhere. Mike was in the kitchen when it happened. Nothing hurt him thank god. So we turned off that light and figured it was just old and needed replaced. A few days later, our remote control to the kitchen television set went missing. We searched the house high and low and found nothing.

A few days after that someone had made coffee early in the morning, left the pot on, and didn't put a coffee filter in. We both didn't believe the other could have done it because we were asleep in each others arms and woke up at the same time. Mike suggested that perhaps I was sleep walking (I was notorious for it when I was young) and causing strange things to happen, or doing things without realizing it. Truth be told though, whenever I'd sleepwalk before I would just walk around and talk to people in my sleep. I'd never done anything like that before, but we still haven't ruled it out as a possibility.

Then a few days after that, michael and I had had a very bad fight outside, and I was crying and he was trying to cheer me up. I sat in the computer room, literally a footstep from the kitchen, and he was trying to reason with me, when the light (the one that had formerly exploded and was turned off) made a very loud noise as though it were exploding again and shot sparks everywhere. I kid you not it seemed like a firework had just gone off in our kitchen. The odd thing was that the electricity was turned off, we checked, and when mike finally pulled it down to check the wires, they weren't fried or singed or bare or anything, there wasn't a thing wrong with the wiring to the light. There have been more incidents, all of which seem to revolve around our kitchen.

A part of me likes to believe that perhaps michael's grandfather was angry with the way he was treating me, and displayed it through the light, another part of me believes it could have just been a very strange coincidence, the fact that most everything revolves around the kitchen baffles me since we spend a very small amount of time in that room. I think that there are two spirits in this house though, one good, one evil, and I believe that michael's grandfather may be protecting and trying to help us. What I can't understand is where something bad would come from. If the house always belonged to michael's family, then there were no former owners, and the only person in his family to have passed away there was his grandfather.

Could that spirit be both good and bad? Is it all coincidence? Why do I only notice it at night? I'm not sure, but my strange feelings have yet to subside. I hope, for my own sake, there is nothing evil in that house.

Mysterious Light Hanging in the Closet,"Michigan, United States",Orbs / Lights / Mists,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Orbs / Lights / Mists :: Mysterious Light Hanging in the Closet

H ello Readers and ghost readers... This incident was so strange and mind boggling that it still does to this day. Which was 14 years ago in the fall of 1993. I was living with my Mother at a condo in Ferrysburg-Spring Lake area. My Father passed away in 1983 of September. Prior to this incident, I was using a Ouija board by myself most of the times; and the other with some friends. When my friends used it, there were making fun and laughing while they were using it. Provoking the board for some action. Next morning, they went out cruising and had a bad accident. Which then probably channeled a spirit out. And in turn caused the major encounter with a spirit.

My room was in the basement, with sliding glass doors out in the recreation or t.v. room. My Mother was gone for the weekend and I was sitting in my bed around 9:30pm just reading. Soon I heard footsteps walking upstairs in the hallway. Main entrance. I thought for sure it was a burglar, but then I didn't hear the stairs or footsteps. Then my door knob was turning slowly. My heart was pounding wondering if I was going to be shot or cut up! I grabbed my beater stick, and then turned the light off. After that my closet was making sounds of hangars sliding on the rack. It did it about 3 or 4 times and I passed out.

I woke up and looked around. Went to the closet and turned the light on and found it hanging. Not only was it hanging; but it was filled with water. No water around the ceiling, the floor or even from a pipe upstairs. I really don't know how this happened. But I wake up looking around and cautiously making sure nothing is around. My life is no longer with spirits, or no more Ouija boards!

My Neighbour's Grandpa,Pakistan,Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: My Neighbour's Grandpa

T his is the story of my neighbour's grandpa in Pakistan. I am from Pakistan and I know that at least 1 out of 2 people will have a personal ghost story (even I do, but I will post them later). So our ""ghost"" in this story is a beheaded character. My neighbour told me that near his grandpa's house, there used to be an alley which people didn't want to go during late hours.

There was a rumour that a beheaded person often scares people passing through that alley alone. So our hero (grandpa) was not quite believing this rumor and was also ignorant. He happened to be late to go to his house and while he was about to leave his people warned him to avoid that alley. But as the grandpa was ignorant he didn't listen to that.

So now he makes a decision to pass through that alley, and so he did, without a second thought. When he almost left the alley he saw a man approaching him towards the alley. Then the man looked at grandpa when he was near him and asked him if he had a cigarette. Grandpa refused and said that he does not smoke but the man kept insisting him to check his pockets and ""check here - check there"" and the grandpa was starting to heat up. Grandpa left yelling and ignoring the man. As he left the man at the back again said, ""Hey do you have a cigarette?"" - so the grandpa turned around saying, ""LOOK MAN...!"" but as he turned around he saw the man holding his head in his right hand like how you hold a helmet. So the brake grandpa was shaken from his head to his toe nails... And ran away. Freaky!

Was It a Last Good Bye?,France,Family / Friends Visits,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Family / Friends Visits :: Was It a Last Good Bye?

M y story took place 11 years ago, in 1996, few days after having experienced the loss of my best friend / ex-boyfriend Phil. In the night of the 5th /6th of march, a party was planned in a club, it was the birthday of one of our friend. As I hated clubs, and still do, I just refused the invitation to stay home with a girlfriend of mine.

My friend Phil was a bit upset and disappointed that I couldn't come, but he managed to take it quite good in the end, we were very close for many years, same school, same hobbies, we were seeing each other every day but each evening, we were spending hours on the phone, talking again about everything! My mother couldn't easily understand but she was ok with it though...

Well, back to this night. After having spent the entire eve talking funny things with my friend Julie, I had a bad feeling, I don't know where it came from, but still, I got pretty upset concerning the birthday party, and I almost regretted not to be there, I told Julie that I had a bad impression. We carried on until late in the night, with this bad feeling around.

Night over, no news from Phil... That was a bit strange. I lived in a house, with a garden and a gate some meters away from the front door, and in the beginning of the afternoon, I went in the garden to wait for ""something"". I just felt that I had to wait here.

Some minutes after, a bunch of friends came over, I saw all of them at the gate and I didn't understand why they were all here, but it was not good at all.

I opened the gate, they were all livid, tired, and some of them still crying. I understood. Something happened to Phil. And yes... He died this night, in a car accident, after the party, on his way home. No one could get him back home, so he got into a car of a stranger with another friend. He died 100 meters away from his house in a violent death, I will spare the details. The other friend died too, but not the driver... Well, as you can guess, I got totally destroyed and at the beginning, I couldn't even cry, I still don't understand why.

Before the burial, I spent 2 nights at his place, in his bedroom. I must add that he was in the bed. His mother wanted to keep him home before the very end. Once again, I will spare the details of that view during 2 days, you can always contact me if you want to read them... But it's far to be nice.

Few nights after this terrible event and the burial, I remember sleeping in my bedroom. I felt some cold air running around, which woke me up, in the middle of the night. I saw nothing but a halo of light on the right corner down my bed, and few seconds after, I saw my beloved Phil, sitting down, quietly, no smile on his face, but well, he looked quite good. Oh my, I was so amazed by this, I couldn't barely understand, I was not afraid at all, I sat down the bed, and after a very short while, he was still there but lifted up his hand, I ran to him, I sat on the floor to touch him, my head on his knees and my arms around him, believe me or not, I could feel him as I feel the computer right now! It was such an intense moment... I asked him 3 questions, and he answered.

I remember that so well, it was a deep instance of bounding love between us 2, I could feel it. Few seconds after, he disappeared, I don't know how, where, and when exactly. I woke up the next morning, I was crying, sitting down the bed, same place... It was the first time I cried after his Death, the very first time, something like one week later. I never saw him again, he never came back to me after this night. Did he come to say good bye? The last good bye? I would not know... I will never forget, nor him, neither this night. If you have some experiences that are close to mine, please, light my torch, I will be grateful :)

Feeling Taps,"Michigan, United States",Old Hags / Night Attacks / Sleep Paralysis,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Old Hags / Night Attacks / Sleep Paralysis :: Feeling Taps

I remember when I was about 10 years old (ish), I had the kind of bunk beds that were in the shape of a ""T"" from a birds-eye view. I remember I went through a phase where I absolutely COULD NOT fall asleep unless I was facing the wall. Eventually, I would start to feel hard taps on my left-hand shoulder blade. Not really violent taps, but hard enough to make it obvious that someone was doing it intentionally.

The first time it happened, I was sure I was imagining it, because I was half-asleep. But, when I woke up and was fully conscious, the tapping didn't stop. Then, my body froze with fear and I didn't turn around to see what was tapping me, right away, because I honestly DIDN'T WANT to see what was tapping me. Then it stopped and I eventually fell back asleep.

It happened again sometime later, I'm not sure of the exact time, because I was pretty young. I turned around REALLY fast, this time. Halfway expecting to see a man in a mask with a gun in my face, I saw nothing. As a kid, I never really thought about being ""haunted..."" I was far more scared of someone breaking into my house and taking me, or something like that.

Lately, (I am 18, close to 19 now) strange, and almost unexplainable things have been happening. I don't have the bunk beds anymore (obviously), but sometimes I can feel something breathing down my neck. Sometimes I feel something plopping down on my bed like a tired person who's taking their shoes off. I've read a bunch of people who said the same thing... But, usually if I fall asleep flat on my back I eventually get temporarily paralyzed and cannot breathe. I don't really feel an evil presence, and I don't think whatever it is has any intentions of hurting me, but I'm to the point where I am just annoyed now, and If it wants something from me, I would like to know what it is, now because I am getting bored with it doing the same things all the time.

My Boyfriend's House on an Island Off the Coast of Iceland,Iceland,Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: My Boyfriend's House on an Island Off the Coast of Iceland

T his is my 2nd story on this web site and this one has nothing to do with my previous one. This one happens at my boyfriends house, I've been living here since February with nothing seriously paranormal happening until This Saturday.

The first week I was living here I did see an apparition in my boyfriend's brother's room. It was of a boy, about 10 years old with blonde hair. Everyone was at work or school when I saw it. Other than that nothing happened until this weekend.

On the Saturday morning I woke up and there were children laughing loudly, it sounded like it was happening in mine and my boyfriend's room. It went on for about 3 seconds and it was at about 12 pm. I went to Rósa, (My boyfriends mum) and asked her if their were any children in the house. She said that there wasn't.

The 2nd incident happened last night (Sunday 23rd September) I went to take a shower and I had this feeling that I was being watched, I regularly peeked out of the shower curtains to make sure there wasn't nothing there. The feeling didn't go away. After I had taken the shower I was still in the bathroom blow drying my hair, when my hairbrush started rocking backwards and forwards. I aimed the blow drying at the hairbrush and it didn't move until the blow dryer was next to it. There was no draft in the bathroom.

The 2nd incident happened about two hours later (at about 11 pm) I was on my laptop when all of a sudden something fell off the computer desk. It fell off the front of the desk and somehow ended up on the back of the desk. I didn't see or feel it move until I heard it land on the floor. It was just there, it wasn't tipped over or anything. I told my friend at school about it and they said that my boyfriend probably died (He works out at sea as a fisherman) and was cleaning the room for me.

However, someone did die, but it wasn't him. This morning I found out that someone that was very near to me died. I'm not sure if it's related or not, but I found it to be a little coincidental. As far as I know my boyfriends family are the 2nd family to live in this house. However, this little island (I don't live on mainland Iceland, I live on a tiny island off the coast with a small population) has a lot of history.

First of all in the 1600s some Turkish people invaded this island killing or enslaving everyone that lived here. During the viking years there was a lot of 'Revenge killing' So if someone killed or did something bad to someone the family is allowed to make the person suffer for what they did. So I'm sure that there are many unhappy ghosts around here and around mainland Iceland.

And if you ever want to talk to me about this experience or something my e-mail is matty.doesnt.know [at] gmail.com, I will also read the comments.

Ghosts of Golden Gate Park,"California, United States",Ghost Hunting,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Ghost Hunting :: Ghosts of Golden Gate Park

G etting terribly lost in San Francisco is a nightmare. I don't know the city - and as a tourist I feel it's my right to bother people and ask for directions. Just so you know I have even gotten lost in Golden Gate Park. I just want to make it perfectly clear that I don't know anything meaningful about Golden Gate Park or San Francisco. Among the thirty or so people that came to Stow Lake for the investigation I was an unknown. I am going through great pains to tell you that there is no way that I could have gotten unconsciously swayed by prior knowledge as to the many paranormal reports of the park. I'd never even looked it up on the web or a map!

We broke off into four groups and by luck the leader of my group was Tommy Netzband, he is the founder of the San Francisco Ghost Society and guide of the Haunted Haight walking tour.

Tommy had mentioned there is a ""Woman of the lake"" ghost story, standard fare that made the ghost-story more unbelievable to me. Tommy himself cackled, ""What make-out spot near a lake doesn't have a ghost story to it?"" With an open heart, skeptical mind and grain of salt I casted myself as the central intuitive of the group, preparing myself to disappoint them all with no dramatic or unusual reports at all, and off we rambled on to the trail surrounding the park.

When there are entities that I need to interface with, I have almost a channeling style. I allow that spirit to directly show me in mental pictures what is important to them and to speak and act through me, however, I don't subscribe to receding your own control or dominance within your body, totally retreating is like letting a complete stranger have a key to your front door and telling them to come over anytime. So my ghost interactions are quite intense and also controlled. As the night wore on this fact became very important to our groups investigation.

Right away I began to absorb emotion and information, so someone really needed to communicate. What was apparent was her sadness and connection to the water. We filed ahead- Tommy, me, Shonna and Marcus. At a point of high sensation Shonna walked close to me and reported dizziness. The EMF showed nothing unusual. A little further down the path as Shonna and I talked about what had just happened, Tommy took another EMF reading. Starting at a normal range then plummeting to a flat 0, and wildly jumping to 4.

It was time for EVP recording, feeling very drawn to the lake I turned my back on the group and walked closer. We all asked questions and left 10 seconds between each one. Tommy asked what the entities name was. I came up with an M or Melissa. He told me that he had come up with Mary. We continued to walk and had some more fluctuations with the EMF, and picked up more electronic anomalies.

We were close to the trail that led up the side of strawberry hill. And over the first/second step of the trail I saw one pinprick of red light that showed itself then disappeared. I reported this after making sure that nothing normal could have accounted for the light. The light seemed to prompt me to walk up the steps. However, I got a specific negative intention from the entity and knew that the entity could harm me through infestation of its negativity, after informing my group of all I told them they should go and investigate without me if they could do this safely with the being.

After they decided to go up I felt guilty for remaining below and joined them on the steps. At this point I saw another pin point of red light over the landing and told them that this was a prompt for them to ascend there as well. They went up and I walked down the steps, feeling dizzy and sensing the spirit would have like me to fall down the steps.

Another group arrived and we caught up on each other's experiences. I then told the leader of that group how the spirit was very negative and wished to harm me and whoever else he could, and again felt my guilt for letting them go up there while I stayed away. At this point I told the other groups leader that I thought I could go up there without getting hurt.

I found Tommy's group working with their equipment and they noted equipment malfunctions with no cause that was obvious. I immediately felt a center of energy not far from where they were. I told Tommy that though it might seem more likely that in life there was violence leading left up the steps, yet I felt certain the violent act had happened by a large conifer on a steep and tangled slope to the right. He told me that it was interesting I said that because just before I had gotten up there he told the group that very thing.

Beyond the pier overlooking the lake I spotted an amorphous mist that was oblong and roughly nine feet high. At a different time, close to the boats, I saw a basketball shaped light that was blue and white. As I tried to explain to Tommy where the location of the light was, we used his laser pen. It continually ""bounced"" off the area in which I had seen the light. The laser malfunctioned dramatically when I attempted to use it. At times only flickering or not activating at all.

This area has convinced me it has active and latent haunting. The evidence was three pronged, intuitive/personal accounts, unusual electronic readings/malfunctions and cross corroboration of investigators revealing a pattern of certain repeatable aspects of activity within it. However, the majority of these hauntings are in hypo-stasis, not seeking, or able to contact. Only a few beings there are interested in contact. There are two beings (feminine and male) that reside at strawberry hill.

I believe that specific area where the violence took place happened to be over an energy earth-gate of moderate concentration. It is hosted by a specific earth energy/entity. The violence there has caused a disturbance of the energy. The haunted activity is a request for the living to minimize or change the negative being then to doctor the energy and help resanctify this area. This would do a tremendous favor in restoring the equilibrium of the area. And restore the important natural earth energy 'gate'.

There were two or three beings at the lake itself that were in active haunting. The one with whom I had communicated the most with was of woman 'M'. The other being(s) was in a para-active state, not seeking contact and interaction. M herself, was not very interested in moving-on or progressing. She is preoccupied with reliving the sadness of her life and wanting the living to also understand what she has been through. Ritually, leaving her flowers and messages of spiritual progression would be indicated. Carefully introducing her to the fact that her baby is in 'heaven' and no longer in the lake may help, but for the ceremonial participants sake this should be done with care and reverence for her.

Finally, there is tremendous energy there, and much of it is the living visitors own emotionality which is feeding or coalescing the native energy and the energy of the beings themselves. Because of the energy problems on strawberry hill there is certain morbidity to the park, but with expert ceremony to normalize it, the natural earth energy and earth entity can contain and care for the overlaying hauntings themselves.

Haunted House in Minnesota,"Minnesota, United States",Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: Haunted House in Minnesota

M y family (husband, 2 daughters and 1 son) moved to Minnesota. My husband at the time wanted a career move and wanted us to come with him. We purchased a 5 bedroom home for the occasion. My husband moved into the house before we did. He was already in the State of Minnesota and waiting for us to move our belongings to the house from Illinois.

There were three entrances into the house. The front, the side and the back where the deck was located. There was no furniture in the house because the furniture was to arrive when we arrived at the end of the week.

The downstairs housed 2 bedrooms, 1 large family room or den, a full bath, and a laundry room. The upper level housed 3 bedrooms, kitchen which was by the stairs that lead to the lower level, dining room, living room, a full bath. The previous owners had left a bedroom set in one of the downstairs bedroom. My husband decided to sleep in the furnished bedroom. Sometime during the night, he heard the (side door) open, someone walk down the stairs and up to the bedroom door to where he was sleeping. He said the footsteps stopped directly in front of the bedroom door. He waited for someone to turn the knob and walk in. He jumped from the bed and ran to open the door and upon opening the door he found nothing but pitch black darkness. He grabbed the bedding and ran upstairs and laid in the living room. He slept there for a week until we arrived. He did not tell us this episode until months later.

My son would be bothered the most. His bedroom was down in the lower level. Sometimes he would see someone walk from the back of the other bedroom to the stairs. That would scare him. His door knob would turn and no one would enter. He would say ""hello who is there"" and no answer. Sometimes he would lay down on the couch in the family room area, and someone would push his head down into the couch. He always felt a presence. If he was bothered to much, he would come upstairs to my room and lay across my bed. My children would tell me they would feel safe in my bedroom.

I even wrote to a psychic and was told there were two ghosts and they are fighting for ownership of the house. That gave me a fright. I did not know what to do.

One time me and my husband was late for work because we could not find the car keys. We would car pool together to alleviate parking expenses. We looked over the entire household. What makes it so weird, is that everyday we would hang the keys on this key rack. Everyone in the household that drove cars would place their keys on that rack. This particular morning we could not find our car keys. Finally, when we were tired of looking, my husband went to the refrigerator to get him something to drink and there was our set of keys on the top rack next to the milk and juice. We were outdone. I could not tell my lawyers whom I worked for that a ghost was playing hide and seek with our keys.

If you're in the kitchen, (like washing dishes or cooking) your back would be towards the lower level. It would feel like someone came up from the downstairs and would stand behind you. You can feel the hairs standing up from the back of your neck. Whenever this happened to me, I would just say leave me along or go away and it would.

My next to the oldest daughter would be afraid of her closet in her bedroom, she kept it closed all the time at night. We had some guest over spending some time at our home. They were laying in the bedroom watching tv when they heard a click and the ceiling fan starting running on its own. I never told them about the spirits in our home. They were really scared. When I returned home, they came out of the bedroom and told me of their experience. That is when I decided to tell them some of our ghostly antics.

One night (I never liked sleeping by the door. I always had my husband to sleep by the door in my bedroom. This stemmed from when I was a kid.), I decided to be brave and sleep by the door in my bedroom (which is the upper level) and went into a deep sleep (which is unusual for me) and I was awaken by a tap on my leg. When I felt the touch and turned towards the doorway and saw no one standing over me, I jumped over my husband and slept by the wall with my head partially covered and fell back to sleep.

We had quite a bit of activity in that home. We lived there for 13 years. I finally sold the home during my divorce and I still wonder if the prior owners have some of the same ghostly encounters.

Writing on the Wall,Ireland,Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: Writing on the Wall

T his is my story that has happened three weeks ago from this day, I have never found any answers to this and I have left my home due to this incident. Myself and my fiance's house was a semi detached house based in a good area of dublin ireland. We had lived at this address for one year and were quite happy. I myself could feel that there was something watching me after about nine months in the house.

One night I was awoken to walking on the landing and stairs area. Half asleep I sat up in bed to see if I was dreaming but the noise had stopped, I lay there for a further ten minutes or so to see if I could hear anything further but I heard nothing.

Something that had been happening for quite a while that we didn't take notice of was our bath mat in the shower room, even when no one used it, was soaking wet, this happened every two to three weeks and there was no water leak anywhere it was a brand new house.

I later alerted my mother that I felt there was a presence in the house and she believed me so she came to the house with me and nothing further happened, so we went for some lunch.

That night I did not feel comfortable staying in the house, so myself and my fiance decided to stay with my mother in her apartment. The next day my mother and I returned to the house and walked into the kitchen the house felt normal as it generally did, but something turned my eyes towards a part of the wall, directly behind our kitchen table. Written in pen on the wall was four jumbled up letters that to this day we cannot make out what it means or says, tears streamed down my face with fright and my mothers, so we left the house, locked the door.

We have been out of the house now for three weeks and I would love if someone out there could explain to me why ghosts or spirits write on walls, I am so freaked out please if anyone knows or can help me understand I would be very grateful.

"Otis, the Movie Theater Friendly Ghost","North Dakota, United States",Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: Otis, the Movie Theater Friendly Ghost

I t was my second week working at my town's local theater and my boss (who's been running the place for years!) forgot to mention Otis. Otis was the first owner of the building. He used to hold illegal drinking/gambling parties in the basement a long long time ago. There's a local legend that he was shot when caught cheating, but I don't know if that's true.

So I was the only one working that night besides my boss, but he was outside washing windows. I just finished refilling the candy counter and I turned out the light. I went upstairs to get a some popcorn bags and I thought I heard Ted (my boss) climbing the stairs with his cane. But nobody was there. Honestly, those stairs are loud and someone was definitely on them.

I got a little freaked out. I started to walk back down, but the door slammed shut and locked. I screamed and pounded on the door until twenty minutes later, Ted came upstairs and helped me. He just chuckled and told me Otis was a practical joker. ""Next time he does that, Ted told me, ""just scold him and tell him to open the door...""

I encountered Otis again another time, and he locked me in the supply closet. My heart pounded but I stayed calm. I said in my sternest voice possible that I was busy and he needed to unlock the door. He did. Now I have a friendly relationship with Otis. He'll hide the candy or flick the lights on and off or only once did he pull my hair. I got angry and told him never to touch me because it scared me. He hasn't done anything of the sort since.

I just wanted everyone to know that not all ghosts are bad. Otis definitely isn't.

The Old Lady Watches While We Sleep,"California, United States",Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: The Old Lady Watches While We Sleep

A couple years back, I was trying to go to sleep but for one reason or another I opened my eyes and looked at the edge of my bed. I noticed an old lady dressed in white sitting at the edge holding something in her hands (it looked like a small candle) but I was too frighten to analyze the item. I froze, I didn't know what to think. I closed my eyes and started praying. Eventually I fell asleep.

The same month a friend of mine was sleeping over, she slept on the floor... The next morning when I woke up I noticed her starring at the door, I asked her how she'd slept, she answered she felt uncomfortable because someone dressed in white stood at the doorway watching us sleep. (She thought it was my mother) I asked my mom if she had gotten up and she said she hadn't gotten up all night and besides that she didn't owned a white gown.

My Friend never came back but since then, friends and family say that my room is very uncomfortable for them to be in. Oh and small kids (i.e. Nephews, cousins) often point to my closet and cry. Oh another occasion my little brother was helping me move some boxes I had stored in my closet, I was in the living room and then a sudden scream followed my uncontrollable crying. We asked what was wrong and at that moment he could not speak. Later when he calmed down we asked if he'd fallen or hurt himself and he said NO, he was frighten by a man's voice who called his name and asked him to go further in.

In addition giggles of small children can be heard late at night (not always though). My neighbor said that he once saw an old lady standing in our driveway late at night.

The Cat and the Hand,"Florida, United States",Apparitions / Voices / Touches,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Apparitions / Voices / Touches :: The Cat and the Hand

I would like to start by saying that this story is not my own, it is actually my mom's, but it is true because she was there and it happened to her. When my mom was younger, she lived with her father, her step-mom, step-sister, and step-brother. Her step-mom had a cat, an orange cat which she loved oodles and caboodles. My mom's job was to keep up with the cat and make sure he was well. Well, when my aunt, uncle, and mom got home she couldn't find the cat. They started FREAKING OUT!

They looked EVERYWHERE, but could NOT find the cat! Then someone knocked on the door of the house. My family was afraid that it might be their mother and they knew she would be unhappy to come home and find the cat missing. So they prepared to tell her the bad news and went to open the door. My uncle was the one to open it but they were all standing there so they could all tell her what happened. When he opened the door, it wasn't their mother it was the cat. But the cat was not on the ground where cats usually are when they come to the door. The cat was floating. IN THE AIR! As if held by a hand by the scruff of the neck. All of a sudden the cat came floating in and was dropped and ran off. Then the Ghost Thing walked out and even shut the door behind him/her. They were a little shaken, but not a lot, since things like that happen to my family all the time. They decided not to tell my Grandmother about it since the cat was home safe and it didn't really need an explanation.

I hope you liked this story, it is my first submitted one since I'm new to this site it is ONE HUNDRED PERCENT TRUE. And like I said, things like that happen to my family all the time. So there will be more!

New Office 2,"Nebraska, United States",Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: New Office 2

Y ou may have seen my original story about my New Office a couple of weeks ago. I decided to do an update, because, well, I am at a loss. I have had many encounters since being a child, they never completely stop. I see 'things' others don't; I see 'things' others do. The same with sounds. I hear them, others don't some times, and others do. But, until now this has dealt only with me personally. This is the first time I have had any experiences at work.

In my original story I had mentioned being tapped on the shoulder, objects being moved and hearing whispers. I also mentioned the ceiling tiles being out of place. There was some question regarding the ceiling tiles. This is a drop ceiling. Above the tiles is insulation and duct work. The tiles are rather large, about 4 foot long by 2 foot wide. They weigh 8.5 lbs a piece. They are suspended from a metal grid work.

A couple of days ago, I came in, unlocked my office and about half of the tiles were stacked neatly in the middle of the floor. I had not been notified of any work being done in my office, so I was a bit confused. The tiles were not taken down from one section. These were removed randomly, almost every other one in the ceiling. About an hour after I arrived, the facilities manager came by, he came in to my office and stated ""what are those doing there?"". I asked him the same question. He said he had no idea. I knew I had not left until late in the evening the night before and he had not had any work man in the building. My office was definitely not having any work done. He and I reviewed the security tapes, (as I stated previously, these tapes are dated and time stamped and I am a secure wing of the building). At about 2:48 AM, you can see my office door open slightly, and then at 3:01 it slams closed! You can hear the slam on the tape! Other than that, absolutely nothing visible or audible the whole night. A workman was sent in to my office to re-hang the tiles. He had a very difficult time with this task because on each of the metal grid areas where a tile had been removed, the metal had been bent upward.

I am still being tapped on the shoulder. I would say at least 2 times a day. When I open the door to the office, there are the whispers as I stated before, at least one male-sounding like about 15 to 20 people whispering in conversation. I have crosses in here, I have begun to use a smoke crystal at Shane 's suggestion and I have a Bible. I am at a loss on this one.

I did ask the facilities manager if there had been any strange happenings in any other parts of the building. He said he could not talk about it now, and ran out of my office. He and I have been pretty close friends, so, this is odd behavior. I called him on his personal line the other evening, seeing if he would talk to me out side the office. His response was ""Let it go, Kim. I am terrified and don't know what to do. If I can come to terms with this in my mind, we will talk"". He then hung up on me. Since the phone call, he has been avoiding me like the plague.

Ghost Head,Finland,Non Human Entities,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Non Human Entities :: Ghost Head

T his story isn't a personal experience of mine, but it happened to my dad and he told me all about it. Now it's my turn to tell you. My dad lived in Finland when he was younger, and as you should know it gets pretty cold over there. It was a winter night and it must have been at least -2F degrees outside. My dad usually sleeps on his side and he was as asleep as anyone can get.

Well, did you ever get the feeling that someone was watching you? That's the exact feeling my dad got that night. He didn't feel like he was in danger, but feeling like you're being watched is pretty creepy. So he turned onto his back to look around his room and what he saw, he says he'll never forget. A glowing green head... Just a head, no body. It was making a really creepy face, but as I said before my dad didn't feel threatened. And just like that, the head floated out of the corner of his room. Although he wasn't in danger, he ran out of the room faster than he had ever moved, screaming. He ran outside in his underwear in -2 degree weather. His mother, my grandma, came outside and scolded him. Told him that he would catch his death of cold.

My dad tells me this is an experience he will never forget. It was the most scared he'd ever been in his life.

Scary Night at my Cousin's New House,Sri Lanka,Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: Scary Night at my Cousin's New House

H i, this is my first story here so it's not going to be the best one. I have a brother and many cousins who are guys, they play pranks on me like hell which sometimes scare me, but now I'm used to it. One night while I stayed at their new house in Palawatte (it's outside the main part of the city), their mom and dad had to go out on some work, so me, and 3 of my cousins explored the house.

The security guard was downstairs and we know him really well, he told us that some guy died here. We didn't believe him so we kept on exploring. We decided to go to bed at around 1 am. And at around 1.45 we can all hear these foot steps. We all got freaked out. And all of us made sure we weren't making any of those noises. And it wasn't the security guard because he was asleep by 10 in his room, And he doesn't come up at 1.45 am (may I remind you that none of the furniture was brought since it was the first day. No curtains nothing. So it couldn't have been any objects making such noises.) We started getting freaked out more and more, and all of a sudden the ceiling fan comes crashing to the floor and lands on my leg. Nothing happened to me, I just got cut, but it's nothing compared to other ways I've hurt myself. And it could have been a co-incidence... I don't know.

But the security guard had a worried face the other morning. He was like. ""a journalist used to live here, and he killed himself by hanging himself by a chain from this very ceiling fan""... We sold the house 2 weeks later. That was ONE of the scariest happenings ever. Even though this happened. My cousins still play pranks on me. There are more stories to come so keep in touch.

Mommy's Back,Canada,Family / Friends Visits,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Family / Friends Visits :: Mommy's Back

H i, I am sixteen years of age and have always believed in ghosts since I was little. My mother believes that there are no ghosts but I am positive that there are. In september my oldest sister who owns an apartment asked if I would like to come over for a couple of weeks and help her with her little boy. I said yes naturally and went over. While I was there I was stationed in the living room on a air mattress. My sister's husband and I were sitting in the bedroom playing W.O.W when he told me that he could see his deceased mother.

She used to come to him in true form ever since she died. But about seven years ago he told her that he couldn't deal anymore and to please leave. He then told me that she only comes in his dreams every so often to check in. I was sitting with my sister's son and he was playing on the floor, he was only 10 months, and then he looked up and started talking baby to nothing. I got down on my hands and knees and asked my nephew what he was talking to and he looked and pointed right at the picture of my brother in laws mother's picture and then continued to talk to nothing. I was quite scared and gently asked the 'force' to leave. I could feel a change in the air after I said that.

The next day I was going to go into my nephew's room to check on him because he was sleeping and I saw a small lady leaning over his crib. She then looked at me and started to walk towards me. She walked through the wall and I was shocked. I then quickly checked my nephew then realizing that he was ok, I walked back to the living room. I was scared so much. I sat down on the couch and looked back at my nephew's door to see a head poke out. I let out a little scream and stood up. It was definitely my brother in laws mother's face. I forgot to tell you guys that after my brother in law told me about his story, I went into the bathroom and asked his mother to please show herself and to grace us with her presence.

The other time that I saw her I was trying to sleep and she was in the hall. My sister and brother in law were sleeping and the ghost was glowing white. She was smiling and then she walked out the patio door. She then walked in thin air and disappeared.

Oh and my sister and brother in law were smoking a cigarette in their room and my sister told me to keep the door closed so that liam wouldn't get the smoke smell. I usually closed the door but the one time I didn't all the doors in the apartment were closed and I was on the PC. And the door closed all by itself. It closed and I could see the door handle turning. The weird thing is that my sister was napping and my nephew was asleep. My brother in law and my sister don't know that I saw his mother. And I don't know if I should tell them... What do you all think?

The Pacing Apparition,"Kansas, United States",Apparitions / Voices / Touches,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Apparitions / Voices / Touches :: The Pacing Apparition

I t was the summer of 1987. I lived on a farm in southeastern Kansas with my grandparents. My little brother and were having a slumber party with three of our cousins who happened to live across the pasture from us. I was thirteen. My brother was ten, and our cousins were about thirteen, fourteen, and eight. My cousin, Jennifer and I were the only girls there, so we watched some scary movies with my brother and my other cousins, then decided to listen to music and gab in my bedroom. My room was in the front of the house, facing the gravel road. There was a tall hedge row in the front yard, next to the gravel road, and the only thing that could be seen from the road at night was headlights from a car.

It was pitch black outside as we sat on the old brass bed which was positioned against the open front window. I glanced out into the stark night through the window from time to time as we giddy girls talked about cute boys at our school, Rick Springfield, and listened to eighties music. At one point in the conversation in which I was trying to make my point (probably trying to convince her of why Led Zeppelin was the best band in the world), I happened to look out the window and see a glowing, tall figure walking up and down the road in front of the farm house. Now, I have no earthly idea how I was so enthralled in the conversation that we were having, that I noticed this bizarre figure only on a subconscious level. I recall seeing this person pacing, but I must have filed it in the back of my mind for later processing. The way my mind works, at times seems almost as enigmatic as this story.

It was rather early in the morning, and it seemed that we had been talking for hours about nothing. All of a sudden, I felt someone staring at me and looked up and out of the window. There my eyes immediately fell upon a tall, gaunt, hollow-eyed, glowing, skeletal figure which was leaning against a tall cedar tree in the front yard by the road and staring at me! As soon as I laid eyes on it, the figure quickly looked away, just the same way a person in real life would if he or she was caught staring at another. My cousin and I watched in utter astonishment as the spirit started off walking down the road and after a few paces, completely vanished.

We both looked at each other, wide-eyed. ""Did you see that?!"", I asked my cousin. She shook her head yes, looking a bit pale. We quickly ran into the living room where our brothers were, hoping that it was them playing a joke on us. Much to our dismay, they were all sound asleep in front of a ""snowy"" television set.

My cousin and I did not sleep at all that night. The next morning we told the guys about it and they were as freaked out about it as we were. I never did find out why the spirit was so interested in me.

I Heard Talking In the Empty Classroom,"North Dakota, United States",Apparitions / Voices / Touches,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Apparitions / Voices / Touches :: I Heard Talking In the Empty Classroom

H ey! It's me! That kid who has seen ghosts! I just heard one today! This is the weirdest story I've ever written, let's begin with, my school is not haunted! I have seen a ghost outside the building, like in the soccer field, but I never actually seen one in the school. I did hear one.

I was early for my Math class and my teacher asked me to go bring a textbook to a teacher downstairs, I said sure. I walked down the steps, went down the hallway, and I saw like three of my friends in a classroom. I said a quick hello and they said hi back and they went back to talking. I gave the other teacher the textbook and I had a couple of minutes until the bell rang so I stopped by that classroom with my friends again to talk.

But... when I got to the classroom, there was no one in there, my friends weren't there, but I heard their voices. I knew it was there voices, and I knew I saw them before in the same classroom. I said in a very soft voice ""Is there anyone in here?"" The talking stopped. And there was no reply. I asked again. No answer. I asked one more time and a book went flying towards me! I moved out of the class room. I quickly went back to my class and was breathing like I couldn't breath at all. No one really noticed. After that day I never went near that classroom again.

I've never heard of our school being infested with ghosts, and I've never heard of a classroom being haunted either. Do ghosts really take the shape of people?

The Ghost in my Bathroom,United Kingdom,Apparitions / Voices / Touches,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Apparitions / Voices / Touches :: The Ghost in my Bathroom

H i everyone I'm new to this web site. I have shared my stories on psychic experiences . I just go through really strange things everyday, really. I have 9 stories on that psychic experience web site. I like to share this story with you anyway. It was on my Thursday which was my GCSE Results day, I was really feeling different on that day. I couldn't tell why I was feeling weird really. On Thursday, after I had got my GCSE Results and helped my mum with the shopping, I just started to wonder around in the house just taking pictures because I was so bored. It was like that was meant to happen me taking pictures. I got to the bathroom when I was just looking in the mirror just to put my lip gloss on. I knew something strange was going to happen but didn't know what. When looking in the mirror the air started to look funny, like blurry. Then all of a sudden I see something moving in the corner of my eye. I was like ""no this can't be there's a boy in the mirror no way"". So I just think to myself ""There's no one in the house only me and mum. I don't know him"". I knew he was a ghost because I saw him come into thin air. When I first walked in the bathroom for some strange reason I did look around but there wasn't nothing there. I did also lock the door after me. He's a ghost alright.

He was a teenage boy around about the age of 14-19 years old. He was wearing blue trackie pants and a dark blue polo shirt with a kind of little picture of a symbol of a bird. He was tall, medium, pale. And brown hair. He looked so clear, just looked real. I tried helping him but it was like he was hiding from someone, he kept looking ahead. I was trying to get his attention but it just wasn't happening. I thought to myself ""I recognize this lad from my dream but what has he been trying to tell me"". I know they can't talk all they do is stare. Then he moved again and crossed his arms and looked straight ahead. Why was he looking straight ahead? I think he saw me at first because he leaned backwards, like proper scared, then he stopped being scared. It was so confusing. Why did he come to me? I wish I just could of helped him really. Thanks for reading.

The Flash of Light,United Kingdom,Orbs / Lights / Mists,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Orbs / Lights / Mists :: The Flash of Light

I just want to tell you what just happened, twice now. Last night I got a flash from the wall to my eye. A bit strange I don't know where they are coming from, it happened once last night and once this morning, and it's not been sunny. Nothing is reflecting, it can't, really, in this room. There's a shot of light which shots straight in my eye, it's like it just kind of bounced off the wall or through the wall because that's where it was coming from. I have been on the computer, nothing flashed from it. It was coming from the wall straight ahead of me, it kind of blinds me for a second, it's really weird and strange. What could this be? It's really shocking that a round light can just come at you from nothing. Bit strange for me. Has anyone been through something like this before? Something new everyday happens to me but it's my life. I have seen a floating cloud now I see flying round light balls which go through me. They go straight through me and blind me for a second. Sorry If it's too short. People say it could have been an orb or spirit which I don't know much about.

A Different Vision of Me,"Colorado, United States",Misc,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Misc :: A Different Vision of Me

I t was last December and the snow hills around my house were huge. So of course I decided, why not climb to the very tip of one? Can't be that bad. It was. I'm usually not afraid of heights, but that day was different. It had to be around thirty-fifty feet high. Very steep. In fact, one side actually indented inward. I thought it was all snow, but it wasn't. The night before, it had actually sleeted a bit and it caused the hill to turn from a snow hill, to an ice hill.

I climbed to the very tip with my best friend, *Abi and my little sister, *Rachel, a fair distance below me. I was scared out of my mind, but I wanted to show them I could be tough. So I yelled at them, ""Hey, look at me! I'm king of the hill!"" I suddenly remembered being a little kid again, playing outside at recess on the small snow hills next to the school.

I told Abi and Rachel to hurry up. I began to carefully sit down, but I guess I wasn't careful enough. I lost my footing and started to slide off the hill on the side where it was shaped inwards like a half moon. I was dangling by one hand for dear life and yelling at the top of my lungs for Abi and Rachel to come help me. Abi raced up quickest, but I couldn't hang on. I prayed my Guardian Angel prayer, begging him to help me. Then I started to fall.

Now this is the weird part. I remember the sensation of falling, but once I got close to the bottom, I stopped, and slowly, I just inched down to the bottom. My eyes were squeezed shut until this point, and when I opened them, I saw a bright light. So bright, I couldn't keep my eyes open. I landed on my feet at the bottom of the hill. My sister and Abi said it was the scariest thing they ever witnessed. I guess they didn't see the bright light, but they saw me land on my head and break my neck.

That obviously didn't happen because I was just fine. Abi and Rachel couldn't explain how they saw me land like that, and I couldn't explain my encounter without writing it first. Does anyone have any comments on how they saw me land on my head and break my neck when I had actually landed on my feet? I don't understand that.

Reaper or Guardian Angel?,Canada,Misc,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Misc :: Reaper or Guardian Angel?

I believe in the supernatural. I believe that things happen for a reason. There are things that happen in my life that I see and feel, things that science can't explain. It has been more than 4 years since the incident and I can't help but think about that day. It replays over and over. I've dealt with many unusual things but this one stands out from the rest.

It was one incident that caught me off guard. I was in college at the time and my classmate, who was a close friend of mine, decided that we would walk over to my aunts apartment after school, which was 5 blocks away. We had someone pick us up everyday, but today it was going to be different, just us two on our own. Let me give you a little history. You see my aunt lived in an apartment building across from a salon adjacent to an apartment and beside the apartment was a funeral home... For two years straight the apartment had people trying to commit suicide by fire on the date November 13( weird coincidence). However within those two years the occupants in the building made it out alive but the people attempting to commit suicide did not.

By the time class was over it was around 3:30. We stayed there late to finish up an assignment and it was about 5:00. It was fall and it got dark early. We set off and walked quickly enjoying the air and conversation. It was pretty dreary and we made the most out of it trying to cheer each other up. So we took our time. The sun was going down quickly and we were so into our conversation we didn't notice it was dark out. By the time we reached the third block it was pitch dark. So we quickened our pace. It was very quiet there was no one in sight and no cars passed us at all. We were walking alongside the sidewalk and there was a road beside us. We were not even half a block away when we noticed headlights glowing behind us. But somehow we felt a bit uneasy because the vehicle was going very slow but we knew it was a couple meters behind us. We felt as though it was following us and started speed walking and the car quicken its pace. It was getting closer and closer so we decided to make a run for it. We ran and turned the corner and so did the car.

About 5 meters away we had seen light coming from a building and ran for safety, before we reached our sanctuary, I looked back and saw the vehicle, it was very old and beat up van and we couldn't see anyone inside because it was tinted and the headlights were shining in our eyes. We ran into the next building for shelter, it was a hair salon. They were closing up and they looked up as we banged on the door and they quickly opened it for us. We told them what happened and they believed us they seemed bewildered by the chain of events. By the time we finished our story and they looked out to investigate the van was gone. They told us that they were closed and would let us into the apartment lobby since it was attached to the hair salon. So we ended up in the apartment building.

Panicking I made a call to my sister and told her to pick us up. I gave her the name of the hair salon and she knew exactly where we were. She found it quite sinister that I would want to be picked up there but she didn't argue. I told her I would let her in on the details as soon as she picked us up. The lobby of the apartment has a huge window to look outside without any curtains and four chairs facing each other 2 on either sides. Behind were two elevators side by side. My friend and I sat on one chair together frightened to death looking around all paranoid. We couldn't see anything outside so we sat in silence.

We noticed a red light in the corner of our eye it was coming from the elevator. It was the dial for the elevator stating what floor the people in the elevator were on. The apartment had 10 floors and it was counting down the floors. It reached 1 and the elevator dinged, it frightened both of us so bad. It opened and to our horror nobody came out of it. We were both frozen with fear. There was dead silence so we looked out the window until out of nowhere, the other door to the elevator dinged, we looked at one another shocked and in fear. The door opened and we heard thumping. Our hearts stopped that very moment. This man over 6 feet tall heavyset and a very dark complexion came out with a large black fedora hat on which covered his eyes. He was in a black suite and was walking with a cane. I've never seen one that fancy it was unique. Very glossy and black, it had a snake head on the top with jeweled eyes. He was not limping at all he didn't seem to use it for support. He sat right across my friend and I. He started tapping his foot methodically and his cane at the same time. We couldn't see his eyes only his face and the hat covered everything else. The man decided to lift his head a bit and I seen his eyes they were white no pupils or anything and grinned. We were paralyzed with fear it felt like time stopped somehow.

In the distance somewhere I heard a car beeping and came out of the state I was in. I grabbed my friends hand and ran to my sister as fast as possible. We got into the car and drove away. I looked back at the apartment building window and no one was there, it was empty. I asked my sister when she was pulling up if she had seen anyone and her reply was ""NO"". While we were in the car my sister found it very strange that we were across the street from my aunt's apartment. At the time of the situation I couldn't see anything only the light in the salon and didn't even realize the apartment was so close in proximity. I've been in the neighborhood late at night and the lamps would always be on except this particular day. I know that around that area it is quite haunted whether the apartment itself and the funeral home being there has something to do with my situation I am unsure.

It has plagued me for many years. To this day I wonder who was in the van that was following us? If they caught up to us what would have happened? Who was that man in the apartment building, was he the REAPER? If it was the REAPER why did he spare our lives? Has anybody had a similar experience?

Orb Affecting Electrical Equipment,"Nebraska, United States",Orbs / Lights / Mists,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Orbs / Lights / Mists :: Orb Affecting Electrical Equipment

M y parents bought a house that was owned by the ""Card"" family. They were hoarders, especially of animals, any animal, and they kept them ALL in the house, and never let them out. Bathrooms and closets were turned into animal housing. The purchase occurred approximately 1 year prior to my birth.

Mrs. Card was an alcoholic, and ended up drinking herself to death in the house. When an autopsy was performed, her blood alcohol level was .38. The rest of the Cards moved afterward. Needless to say, my parents got the house for a significant discount.

I never really noticed any activity growing up, but my bedroom was on the first floor. The move to the basement was when the weird stuff started to happen. Up until my 16th year, the basement, which was basically a three-bedroom apartment, had always been rented out because my parents could use the extra income to feed myself and my 3 brothers.

As soon as one of my brothers and I moved down there, we noticed strange occurrences, but nothing major. Light bulbs would only last for a month, batteries would be dead after opening the package brand new. It wasn't until I had a computer that the REALLY active period began.

I had the computer in my room. It was directly to the left of my bed. It was plugged into a surge bar, along with a reading lamp, a printer and a clock radio. I was on the computer quite a lot, but I always turned it off before I went to bed. I started to notice that when I would wake up, my computer was on. I told myself at first that ""I must just have forgotten to turn it off last night..."" This event happened once a week at first, then it became a nightly occurrence. Eventually, I specifically unplugged the surge bar from the wall before I went to sleep. This tactic worked for about a week.

One night I was sound asleep when I was awoken by the sound of a loud bang. I sat up in bed, obviously wondering what was going on. One second later my computer, reading light, printer and clock radio all came on at the same time. Then I saw a glowing orb about the size of a golf ball float over my bed about chest height (if standing) and go through my bedroom door. At that point my bedroom (overhead) light came on. My bedroom was a bit strange because the light switch was located just outside the door.

I said the Lord's Prayer and went back to sleep. I have since moved away and never experienced anything similar to that in my life.

Not a Very Scary Ghost,"Oregon, United States",Poltergeists / Physical Manifestations,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Poltergeists / Physical Manifestations :: Not a Very Scary Ghost

T his is not your typical ghost story, strange, yes, but not threatening. The house in question was one of my best friends houses, it was built in the 1920's and a chiropractor had died in the 40's in her brothers bedroom. The first time she experienced the ghost was when she snuck into his closet to take a few of his cd's, while she was fingering the goods, the closet door began to bang and a weird nasally noise emitted, she freaked out and ran out. Needless to say she didn't try to steal his cd's again.

A couple years later she moved into the room her brother had once occupied, that's when I started experiencing things as well. First of all more than half the pictures we took in that room when developed had odd smokey forms or blue-geen slashes randomly in the frame. They had an old intercom system throughout the house, and sometimes when I would go by they would go off and make staticky noises. Downstairs the roommates claimed that the stereo would go on and off, volume up and down, and stations changing by themselves, the only relief they got was when they unplugged it. In the basement there was this door that had stairs behind it that led to nowhere, (they rebuilt the staircase for some reason), the doorway to nowhere was a creepy thing to behold, so the tenants down there moved the refrigerator in front of it, and then the next day the fridge somehow moved so that the door was again exposed. They put the fridge in front of the door again, and the next day the same thing occurred. After that they gave up and just tried to ignore the phenomenon.

I did the ouija board (stupid I know), and asked for a sign of the man's presence, almost immediately a stack of nearby magazines fell. I stopped playing the game. One day I was late for work and was searching for my purse, my friend (who lived there) helped me search the bedroom, we tore the place apart, looking everywhere but to no avail, anyhow I was getting flustered and I decided to try something different. ""I want my purse and I want it now!"" I yelled, as I stormed outside to smoke a cigarette. When I came in five minutes later, low and behold there was my purse on the bed where it definitely was not before.

One last little story... The house in question I suppose could be categorized as a party house, always lots of people, with tenants on every floor, my friend had the upstairs and always had lots of girls over. One July, all of us went to the country fair (big hippie fest out here) we were away for four days. When we returned the roommate downstairs told us of all that happened in our absence.

Apparently the second night we were gone (and until we returned), the upstairs door slammed open and shut all day, even when he would latch it, there was no wind, it was July after all and mellow weather out west. He also claimed that someone kept knocking at his bedroom door and when he would open it, no one was there but that it was really cold, cold enough to see his breath (JULY!) and finally along with the door slamming all day, he heard stomping from upstairs constantly. As soon as we got back everything went back to normal.

I don't wanna bore you, there are many more stories that go with this house, but the thing I wanna stress is that this ghost never tried to hurt us, I think he just wanted attention, and if I could go back, I would do EVP research and try to communicate and help the poor spirit.

My Friend's Aunt,United Arab Emirates,Family / Friends Visits,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Family / Friends Visits :: My Friend's Aunt

T his happened when I was in Baguio (Philippines), the summer capital of my hometown. I rented a room at my friends house, the room was next to the kitchen downstairs. It has 2 doors, one is just right opposite the bathroom. My friends were planning to go out that night, sad at my part because I was sick, I needed to stay home. Half lonely, when they left I bid them good night.

When I was at my bed trying to get some sleep, I heard someone moan on the other bed, you see my room has 2 beds facing each other only a small cupboard to separate it. I'm on my side facing the wall and thinking of my friends having good time without me, when I heard another moan, this time it's louder than the first. I didn't bother to check it or make any reactions with it since I was thinking that maybe I was delirious. And I heard it again, the only difference is this time I heard the creaking of the bed as if someone was really there moving. I told myself to leave it alone and just go to sleep since maybe we are both sick. (funny and stupid of me). Maybe that ""it"" wanted me to keep awake all night or wanted me out of the room.

I was only 2 weeks in that room and that was the first time I heard something like that. I knew someone had died there but it was my friends aunt. The moaning continues with the creaking of the bed and this time, I heard a light coughing. That was the time decided to go out of the room and go speak to my friends mom about it. I counted 5 and quickly stood up without looking at the other bed, I didn't feel dizzy or sick that time, I really wanted to go out. As I spoke to my friends mom, she told me that it was her sister. So, she went down to my room and I heard her talking in front of the door of my room:

""Stop bothering the girl, she's here renting the room. You should be grateful because she helps us pay the electricity and she even shares the food.""

She went up and told me that her sister won't bother me anymore. Still, I stayed up with her until my friend came and she sleeps with me in my room. I didn't hear or feel anything after that. Maybe, she accepted me as part of her family but I heard more things in that house after the incident with my friends aunt. I heard chains being dragged, footsteps on the stairway, little voices, doors being opened and close but nobody was there.

I was a bit scared but I let it go since they don't bother me and not hurting anyone. They're just there, maybe doing their old routine when they were still alive. Who knows?

Something Is Breathing on Me!,United Kingdom,Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: Something Is Breathing on Me!

H i just want to tell you what I go through every night. I don't know if it just me who experiences this but it's really strange. I do think my house is haunted in a way but only me sees it that way. Every time when I go in the bathroom at night time, I get scared because I have seen a ghost standing in the bath, when I just turned my back, then turn back round and he was there. Every time I go into that bathroom I feel like I'm being watched and something is going to sneak up behind me. When I see something for a split second I scream because it really upsets me.

Right then when I'm in bed, the lights off, everyone's asleep, you see this light shine through the gap in the door, I see it in the corner of my eye then turn my head and I see it. Then something stands in front of the gap in the door, all of a sudden everything goes dark and the light disappears.

Then I can see something either a half a moon, it feels like I can see through the wall and see the moon outside, seeing through the door and seeing the landing. I feel like I can see through things.

Then I'm about to nod off to sleep until something is breathing on me and the air touches my face, it's really strange.

It's not a demon because they do horrible things but I have heard they do breathe on you and they can also pause you and scream at you and show their red eyes. I read too many stories!

Noises Coming from my Parents Room,United Kingdom,Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: Noises Coming from my Parents Room

I love this web site because there are people to talk to about these things. I can also learn and find out what other people go through. I love just telling people about things which I have been through.

Only 2 weeks ago I heard a girl's voice, it sounded like a little girl's voice and 5 minutes after she made a bang. My parents were down stairs, I was upstairs in the spare bedroom on the computer when this happened. It sounded like it was coming from my parents room because the creaky noise comes from that bedroom. You only get that creaky noise when someone is walking in that bedroom which no one was at the time. My dad said ""what was that noise"" I just said ""I don't know"".

I couldn't really say it was a little girl ghost because he would think I'm going mad. After he left it and went back to watch television. I went looking and nobody was there.

When I walk up stairs at night on my own I have a strange feeling of someone watching me coming from my parents bedroom. It scares me in a way like something going to harm me but it doesn't. I just have to start thinking positive than negative. I just get a strange feeling about that room and now and then, I do hear someone walking in that room. Could this be a ghost/spirit? I have seen a ghost teenage boy in the bathroom just 1 or 2 months ago. It's like they're standing near the door because I do get that feeling when I know they're standing near the door. I got that feeling when in my boyfriend's old house that someone was watching me and standing near the door. I looked there was a other teenage boy ghost, standing against the door, looking at me.

Uncle Rocky part 5,Canada,Family / Friends Visits,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Family / Friends Visits :: Uncle Rocky part 5

I have a lot of experiences that I have attributed to my brother-in-law, Rocky. I had an extremely vivid dream about having a conversation with Rocky when everything started to happen and so I assumed he was fooling with us on a regular basis. Today I was thinking of submitting a story and I realized that maybe all of these experiences aren't caused by Rocky. Some things I truly feel are Rocky's doing, other things - I'm just not so sure. I thought I would call this one 'part 5' but from now on I'll just relate the things that happen around my home. There is still the same tone of playfulness to the things that happen.

On, or around, June 14 2007, I went up to bed to read before going to sleep. I got all settled in with my book and just started to read when I heard this weird static buzzing sound. It was just really quick, like half a second, enough to get my attention. I thought it came from outside because I couldn't identify what the sound was. I went back to reading.

A short time later I heard the same sound and again shortly after that. I realized it sounded like the noise my alarm clock makes when I switch it on and push the button quickly past the radio setting. I didn't see how that could be because I wasn't anywhere near the clock. It was summer holidays so I didn't have to get up early to get the kids off to school. I hadn't even been using my alarm so I figured I either imagined the sounds or they must have been from outside. I just let it go as one of those things and put it out of my mind.

On June 16, I was asleep and had been for a while when suddenly my alarm clock/radio started blaring music. It scared the heck out of me because I had been sleeping peacefully and it was such a rude awakening.  The first thing I did was look at the clock, it just registered in my mind that it was after 2:30am. I jumped up and grabbed the clock to turn it off, at first not thinking, just wanting it to shut up. Then I realized that it was playing music, which was very odd because I have never had the clock set to music, always to buzzer. I tried every switch and button on the clock but nothing was even turned on. Not one of the buttons was on. I turned the radio channel dial, the volume dial and flicked switches off and on and yet it still kept blaring music. Finally I had to unplug it to make it stop, which it did.

After I settled down from being scared out of my sleep, I started to think about what had just happened and I saw how weird it really was.

First thing odd was that being summer holidays I didn't have my alarm turned on at all. Also odd was that my alarm was set at 6:35am if it were to go off and this happened, like I said, at sometime after 2:30am. Another odd thing was that I have never had my alarm set to music wake and never ever even used the radio setting to listen to music.

At that point in time I was the only person who ever went into the bedroom, my husband's back had flared up and he wasn't able to climb the stairs. He was sleeping on the day bed on the main floor, had been for at least a week before this happened and probably for 2 weeks after as well. He was in bad shape.

My kids never went into my room, they had no reason to and even if they did, they are too old to fool around with things like that. Not to mention that their bedroom is down in the basement. They would be far too lazy to head up 2 flights of stairs just to screw around with my clock. I had unplugged the clock in order to make it shut off and never plugged it back in. When I did need an alarm, once school started up again, I used a different clock. Honestly, I didn't trust that one anymore.

Maybe it was Uncle Rocky, I had thought he was responsible for all of the odd things that happened, and there has been a lot and I still have more to tell, but now that I think about it - I wonder...

Thanks so much for reading my story, I hope you enjoyed it. I have some more things to tell (when I get the time) and things seem to happen every now and then. That's why I keep a running journal and am so specific with some of the dates, I write them down when they happen.

Was that You Mom?,"Alabama, United States",Family / Friends Visits,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Family / Friends Visits :: Was that You Mom?

H i, everyone! This is a story about my first experience. My mom died in a bad car accident when I was 7 in 1989. I was extremely close to her and it tore me apart. At that time, I was taken away from the family I knew to live with my real dad and soon to be step-mom. I was at a point where I was having post-traumatic nightmares and trying to adjust to my new family, home, and school.

One night, I was asleep in my room and something woke me up. I opened my eyes and saw a smokey figure standing by my bed. Of course, I was about 9 and it freaked me out, so I turned to face the wall and prayed to God to make it go away; not thinking it could have been my mom there to comfort me. After praying, I turned back to see if it was still there, and it was gone... Oddly, I was not scared.

After that event, I got curious. I got up and went to the kitchen to see if I could figure out a logical explanation of what I had seen. I smelled by the stove to see if something was burning. It was in the middle of the night, so who would be cooking? Every knows about the first experience; you always try to think of a logical way to put things together, instead of just accepting the fact you just saw a ghost. I went back to bed, but I couldn't sleep. I kept asking myself, ""Why didn't I ask if that was her, or tell her I love her and miss her so bad?"" I guess I got freaked out in the moment.

I'm 25 going on 26 and I feel her around me sometimes, but most of all, I can smell her. Even if it's just for a split second. It makes me smile. My step-mom never allowed me to talk about her because she was jealous. I had held this in for many years until her and my dad split 10 years later. Then I met a woman in 2003 that I refer to as my adopted mom. She has a what I call the ""sixth sense"" with many more stories to come.

Thank you for allowing me to share this and I hope you've enjoyed it.

Most Houses Can Get that Strange Feeling,United Kingdom,Psychic / Medium,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Psychic / Medium :: Most Houses Can Get that Strange Feeling

H i my name is Katie, just telling you about a strange feelings you can get in houses. I believe that ghosts do live in houses because they don't know they're dead and they think your house is their house. Have you experienced anything strange in your house or anyone else's house?

Most houses you either live in or your friend's, when you walk into them you can have that horrible feeling inside like your being watched, something staring straight at you but you can't see them. It makes you feel uncomfortable inside and it's hard to speak. It feels like something strange is going to happen and the room gets cold. You can get a nice feeling of a house or a horrible feeling of a house. Every time you turn your back it can be there and when you turn round you see something for a split second and for some reason you scream like it's not you who wanted to scream. You know you saw something why can't it show itself than doing it unexpected or never. I feel like there's not just me in the room.

Sometimes a room I'm in is hot then all of a sudden it goes all cold, that happens a lot. I have seen a ghost at my boyfriend's old house and he saw one as well before I saw him, and one at my house I wasn't imagining it either. Things can be moved or get lost, I have seen my brush move for a strange reason like someone tried picking it up then gave up and dropped it. Have you ever had something like this happen in your life?

Face in the Mirror,"Massachusetts, United States",Apparitions / Voices / Touches,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Apparitions / Voices / Touches :: Face in the Mirror

M y boyfriends house has a lot of history in it. His brothers, and sister, as well as his parents have all had unexplained things happen. Weird feelings, seeing things out of the corner of your eye, and so on. I've also had a few strange things happen to me. But the one that stands out most is the one that happened about 7 years ago. We Lived in the attic of his parents home, which was a large 4 bedroom house. I always felt a little uncomfortable when I was alone in the house as if someone was watching me. Never felt unsafe, just... Not alone.

So one night, I woke up at about 2am to go pee. I checked on the baby, who slept upstairs in the (finished) attic with us, and sleepily climbed the stairs down to the bathroom. I sat on the toilet with my eyes only half open, looking into the mirror. I nearly lost my breath when I looked up and saw a face. It wasn't a human face, it looked like an old Roman statue. It was white, and looked as if it was carved out of plaster, The hair was curly and the eyes were just hollow, it wasn't scary looking, but it frightened me because... Umm well there aren't supposed to be statue faces in the mirror! Haha.

When I told my boyfriend and his parents about it, they just kind of looked at each other and shrugged their shoulders. I convinced myself that I was just over tired and didn't really see anything, but the things that continued to happen in the house really made me think twice about my theory.

I've got plenty more to share with you guys. Thanks for reading!

Dark Shadow in the Closet,"Arkansas, United States",Old Hags / Night Attacks / Sleep Paralysis,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Old Hags / Night Attacks / Sleep Paralysis :: Dark Shadow in the Closet

I t's hard to pick one story to share with someone, or many people. I have decided to take the advice of my ""adoptive"" mother. In my life there have been many things that have scared the living hell out of me. This happened when I was ten, in Kansas City Missouri, in the home of my parents.

I was getting ready for bed, and kept feeling like someone was watching. Of course it scared me, but I had that feeling before. So I went on with my routine, brushed my teeth, my hair and grabbed a book to look at while I was falling asleep. All the while, the same feeling that I was being watched and that someone wanted to hurt me. I decided after a few minutes of freaking out and searching around my room to turn all my dolls and stuffed animals around so they wouldn't look at me. That I would just turn out the light and go to bed.

Since I was still pretty scared I kept on a light on my desk. I laid there for a while wondering, thinking that this was a joke my younger brother was trying to play on me. Just when I was ready to shut my eyes the closet door opened. Honestly I am still afraid of open closets in a dark or mostly dark room. I watched as this thing came towards me, sat down on the bed and just looked down at me. He, and I use ""HE"" because that was the feeling I got from him, mean, cruel, dark shadow. I wanted to cry, as I felt him sit on my feet. I felt the whole body weight of someone on me. For a minute or two he just sat there on my feet looking around, turning his head this way and that, then finally looking down at me. I couldn't breath, I couldn't yell, cry, I couldn't even move. Every bone and muscle in my body betrayed me.

I tried to close my eyes, just to move something in me to move. To get up. He slowly reached out for me. Reaching for my face. I felt cold on my chin and then on my neck. Then nothing. He disappeared just as quickly and as quietly as he came. I sat for a minute and cried like a baby. Then ran to my parents room to tell them what I had just witnessed, my mother just looked at me and told me not to say anything to anyone.

This is one experience in my life. I am slowly learning to live with what I see, hear and feel. But it's hard. Because I don't understand what I am supposed to do. I can't ignore these things in my life, but I can't devote my life to them.

The Running Shadow,"Arizona, United States",Apparitions / Voices / Touches,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Apparitions / Voices / Touches :: The Running Shadow

O nce, when I was very small, I saw something very strange. This is a short story but I believe it is worth telling to someone. When I was no older than six or seven years old and when I lived in a town called Wildflower Ranch in Goodyear, Arizona. I lived with my mother, father, and my older brother and sister. One early evening, around seven o'clock when it was barely light outside and the sun was setting and the sky was cloudy, I was watching a game show with my brother and sister in my my sister's room.

My siblings had gone into the living room to watch it with my dad (my mom was at work) and I had refused to go with them so they turned the T.V. off. I was laying on the floor in front of the window facing the T.V. on the opposite side of the room. The sky shown grey though my window casting a dim light. I sat there for a mere three minutes before I saw it. It was the shape of what seemed a man, and it ran across the television. It had looked at me, not with eyes, it didn't have eyes, but I could tell it glanced at me because I saw that its head was turned facing towards me.

We had a bathroom right next to the T.V. And it ran in there. But as it ran it was perfectly shaped but blurred and dark just like a shadow and when it ran it made a very faint sound as if wind were blowing through high snowed peaks. Realizing my fear I called for my sister. When she came I had told her what had happened. To my horror she told me she saw the same exact thing peeking out from the hallway. She said she had walked over there to get a better look when it disappeared. And that's when she heard me calling her. She, being my oldest sibling, was also frightened.

My dad came to take a look but wanted to think it was something from me and my sister's imagination. But I, knowing my dad, had many experiences with things like this in his lifetime and I know that for a fact for he had told me. But many years later (which means this year) my parents got divorced due to alcohol. My mother and I still live in Goodyear but only closer to Avondale. My father still lives in that house with my older brother. My older sister is now a US Marine along with my brother following her.

But ever since then I was never too fond of that house. I visit it from time to time for my dad but from time to time I still have my superstitions...

The Black Shadow in the Hallway,"California, United States",Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: The Black Shadow in the Hallway

A bout 5-6 years ago me and my parents lived in my grandmother's house, my grandmother's house is pretty small, old and the floor was was basically hollow so I could hear who was coming and who was leaving. One night, it was hot and I left the door open in my room, there is only one hallway in that old little house, which was right outside my door.

My grandmother could not sleep without the restroom light on which was right across the hallway and I can't blame her after this night. That night I was awoken by stomping, like someone was marching in the hallway, I sat on my bed rubbing my eyes for a second, a little angry because it was 3 am and someone was waking me up. I stood and I said ""grandma go to sleep its late..."" I looked at the figure (my eyes were pretty blurry) as my eyes cleared I saw it wasn't my grandma, but a black shadow like figure, the only features on it was its head. It did not even look at me but kept marching down the hall. I froze I could barley breath the hairs on the back of my head stood up as it finally made its way into the kitchen, I ran into my grandmother's room.

When I got in she was awake and I told her what had happen and she said that she thought it was my grandfather and that it wasn't the first appearance it made. She had said the first time it came around, it was about twenty years ago, my mother and my aunts where party going teens. One night they came late from a party and my grandmother was pretty angry with all of them and while my aunts and my mom where getting ready for bed, the back door suddenly (which was chained because my grandmother was protective of her children) burst open and something came walking in, my grandmother had ask who was in the house, yet no one answered, the thing just walked in the hallway.

The other sighting was when my brother was about be run over in a busy intersection, he was 3 years old and my mom barely saved him and when she went to go wash her face in the restroom, as she looked at her reflection, she saw that same black figure walking in the hall way. Right now my cousins and my aunts live there and I had ask my cousin I'm closest with and he said that he had seen it too. What I wanna know what is this thing  Has anyone seen something like it?

The Piano Plays On,"Alabama, United States",Poltergeists / Physical Manifestations,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Poltergeists / Physical Manifestations :: The Piano Plays On

T here is a small little town near Dora that's called ""Old Dora"" mainly because back in the day, it was the place to be, complete with stores a library, a methodist church, and even a train station. Over the years though, people began to build buildings farther away from it. And eventually it became ran down and abandoned. Over the course of the last 30 years. Buildings have been torn down, if they haven't already collapsed, and only a handful of places remain, including the methodist church, train station, library, and the furniture store.

The concrete wall supporting the railroad tacks is now a giant mural, covered in spray painted artwork from years past and years present, even me and my friends who claim Old Dora for ourselves have left our mark there. Most of the time we go up there at night and go into some of the old buildings to try and make contact with spirits who visited there, worked there, etc. Well, the church has always been locked. And there was no way to possibly get in without breaking in. But I wasn't about to break into a church. One night, me and my friends were doing our usual round, and that's when we noticed the door was standing open on the bottom floor. See, the bottom floor is near the main road which is still occasionally used, but the second floor is near the road of Old Dora, and it's up above the main road.

I looked at my watch. It was 11:37 p.m. and everyone was talking about finally getting to go inside. I felt a little bad about going in, just some weird feeling in the pit of my stomach. But we eventually walked inside. A bunch of debris lay scattered everywhere, and the bottom floor was huge. I walked around a little bit and noticed an old piano leaned against the back wall, I played a little tune on it, then my friend noticed the stairs going up to the top floor. I walked over to the group, consisting of four people including myself and we started to go up the rounding stairs.

Suddenly from up there another piano began to play, and play well. But we freaked out and got out of there. The next night we decided to go back. We thought maybe someone had broken in and when they heard us down there, they tried to scare us away. So we walked back there, the clock nearing midnight. The door was now closed. We walked over and tried it, and the door was unlocked. So we walked inside and started back towards the steps. We stopped for a minute and gazed at them, twisting upwards so that you couldn't see what was up there. My friend walked over to the other piano that was near the back wall and played a little tune. He stopped and we listened for a minute. Nothing happened so we decided to go on up.

We got to where the stairs twist then soft piano music began to play up there. Two of my friends ran back down but me and Sean continued on. We found the piano. A large, black grand piano sitting against the wall nearest the stairs. Only no one was there. I stared down in horror to see the key being pressed down by invisible hands. Me and Sean left when we saw that, we stopped out on the street and the piano music echoed out onto the street. Finally it stopped as we began to walk away.

Until this day we can't explain what was going on, but sometimes when you walk up there around midnight, you can hear soft piano music coming from the old church.

I Opened the Door to Demonic Spirits,"Texas, United States",Demons / Possessions / Exorcisms,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Demons / Possessions / Exorcisms :: I Opened the Door to Demonic Spirits

W hen I was 17, I opened a door that should have remained closed. I was at the public library and checked out a book about demons. I was always an avid reader and to me, it was just another ""horror"" book, I checked out for 2 weeks. I really had no concept of demons, I believed in God, but just not so much in the other end of things. I had the concept of God and angels, and if they were truly in Heaven, then nothing bad could be there. They protected us, right? That very concept changed forever. Hello, crash course in freewill.

I ended up reading the book, and the next thing I know, I started seeing the shadows. The dark ones, some looked like crows, some black cats, and then the smaller humanoid types. There was one, more human, who was taller, dark and he was everywhere. If I was reading, I could see his shadow, leaning over my shoulder as if reading with me. He would also be on the roof, hanging down peering into my window. I could see his form, blocking out light, and hanging there upside down, like a crouching bat. He had pointed ears, and I will never forget that silhouette against the starry sky, watching me.

My sister began seeing these things, too. We both saw what looked like fighting, bolts of blue and white lightening that streaked across darkened rooms at each other. The most amazing occurrence was when we were at the movies and the whole theater was a ""battle ground"", with us being the only ones who could see the lights. In retrospect, I do believe it was ""good & evil"" fighting.

I think I was more curious and mesmerized, than concerned by all of this going on. Until one evening, I was lying across my bed, reading as usual, and I felt a hand touch my foot. Hard pressure on the sole of my foot, grasping. That scared me... Whatever this was could touch me.

The end came quickly to this situation, a couple of days later. Late one Friday night, I was home alone, and my mom and sister drove up. In the headlights of the car, my sister saw a huge demon, hairy & tall, like a buffalo on its hind legs, and it was running around the house, trying to escape the headlights. My mom didn't see it, nor did she or my dad ever see any of these happenings. My sister thought it had been after me, and she was terrified. Her fear was palpable as she told me what she saw, she told me to take care of this, and get it the hell out of our home. I was horrified.

The very next morning, a Saturday, I found myself home alone, a godsend in a house where Saturday mornings were the optimum time for everyone being home. I cleansed the house, blessed the house, and got that book the hell out of there. I never saw it again at the library, even though the section of horror I perused was near where I found it. I hope it was removed from the shelves and destroyed.

Funny thing, I have a feeling it never made it back to the shelves... I have a strong feeling it was never supposed to be there in the first place. The thought of burning the book never crossed my mind. I just wanted things sent back to Hell where they belonged, and all things in my world back to where they had been before. I succeeded in clearing the house of all evil, no more shadows, lights, touches, or seeing anything EVER AGAIN.

The downside is I will always regret having my sister feel that horror and fear, the upside is that my faith in all that is good, was strengthen beyond all that I could have imagined. I know now what's out there, and I will use my belief to send it away every chance I get. I hold that faith close to this day.

These things were getting stronger, more brazen, and I never want to even consider opening ANY doorway again. I was uninformed, stupid for doing that, and utterly ignorant for bringing that into my home. This all occurred in a 2 week period, and I thank God, my faith was intact.

I was considerably blessed that I realized the problem was growing beyond me, and that I had the strength to send it back. I hope someone learns from this... It's not a game, it is REAL. And it is awful.

The Warning,"North Carolina, United States",Demons / Possessions / Exorcisms,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Demons / Possessions / Exorcisms :: The Warning

T his story isn't a very long one but it does require a bit of explaining first. In my last story The Tiki Face Phantom I made mention of a girl that I had been dating. When we met it was a really bad time in my life so the relationship had some what of a rocky beginning that never got better, but got much worse as time progressed. I have never in my life fought and argued with someone no where near as hard. She had the tenacity of a pit bull. In her mind she's ALWAYS right period. Our arguments could last for days on end.

After some prodding I decided to start going to church with her. (Where upon by the miracle of Christ I was saved.) God does work in mysterious ways. And it was at this church that the incident took place in my home town of Hickory N.C. We had decided to meet in the church parking lot for Wednesday evening Bible study. When we arrived we discovered that it had been canceled for some reason or another so we went back to the parking lot which was lit up by a light pole. She opened her door to her car and got in. All I had intended to do was lean inside her opened window and kiss her bye. Well, she used this opportunity to restart a very heated argument that had been going on for awhile. It had progressed into a full blown cursing match right there in the parking lot just feet from the church! There wasn't anyone around to hear us thank God. At least no one we could see that is.

Here's the setup, she was in the driver seat of her car with her window rolled down with the passenger side rolled all the way up. I was leaning inside her window with my elbows on the door going at it tooth and nail with some spectacular off colored come backs I'm sure and that is when it happened. The only way I can describe this is like when you stick your mouth to glass and breath deeply on it it leaves condensation where your mouth had been. Then if you wish you can take your finger or whatever and draw pictures or words.

If you have ever seen the movie ""Ghost"" with Patrick Swayze where in the scene he's in the bathroom (invisible of course) chasing his would be killer and he turns the hot water faucet on full blast to steam up the mirror and writes with his finger the word BOO! This would give an accurate description as to what I witnessed. As I was leaning in just inches from her face there suddenly appeared some one or something's breath on the outside of the passenger side window which I had clear view of. Inside of that breath contained a perfectly drawn picture of a demon face. But only half of one. I mean the pointy ear, horn and goatee. Everything. If you have ever seen the mascot for Duke University the face was identical to that. It appeared and dissipated in a couple of seconds. Just long enough for me to see it and for my jaw to hit the pavement.

I immediately told her that we had to stop and pray really hard right then. Which we did. Trust me that was no figment of my imagination. That image is forever burned into my mind. I would really like to get some feedback and opinions on this one. I'm curious if anyone has ever witnessed such a thing for it freaked me out pretty hard. The way I perceived it was God's way of showing me that the devil himself was looking in on the other side egging it on and wanted to reveal his presence in order to stop hate fueled battle that was ensuing on his holy ground. I have many more experiences to tell so until next time please send in your thoughts and your comments. Peace out.

Growling Ghostly Dog,Germany,Pets / Animals,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Pets / Animals :: Growling Ghostly Dog

T his story was told to me by my best friend whose father was in the army and station in germany. She said that even thou she was only 8 years old when this occurred, she can still remember it like was yesterday. They had just moved into this house that was made into 2 apartments. Her grandparents lived in the first floor and they lived on the second. They were there for a very short time when strange things began happening, little things like her mother would be in the kitchen and having full conversation with who she believed was her mother-in-law walk into the living room and nobody was there, even thou she was be responded by someone.

Someone tapping her mother shoulder while she cooked. Then one night while they all slept. Her mother was awaken by someone knocking on her door. She lived on the second floor so YOU had to come down the steps to answer the main door as she walked to the stairway the knocking got louder they were almost banging at this point her father Awoke ""who's at the door? And why are they banging like that?"". Now these people had just moved to Germany so they didn't know anyone. They got to the top of the stairs and her grandfather came out his apartment and looked up when suddenly the banging just stopped, they all looked at each other. The grandfather peered OUT the door, no one was there. He looked at his son and said ""Maybe they are gone now...""

So everyone went on their way back to bed when all of sudden the banging began this time louder, so loud that my my friend and her little brother awoke from a sound sleep. She came her bedroom and found her mother and father standing at the top of steps just staring at the door. Her mother looked at her and said ""get back in your room"". Being nosey she didn't close the door to her and stood near the entrance so she can hear and she heard her mother say ""who the hell is that?"". Her father just stared and the banging stopped. Once again her grandparent come out staring at the door, now they start hearing slight scracthing on the door. ""Don't open the door pop!"" screamed her father. Then the banging started followed by loud growling like a beast, a dog of some kind, just clawing away at the door. They were scared, the grandparents came upstairs and as whatever it was just banging and clawed at the door then silence.

After 3 hour of them just waiting for it to happen again they all fell asleep. When they awake the next her and grandfather opened the door and found huge scratches on the door like someone or something was trying to claw their way in. My friend said the sounds they heard that night she would never forget. Her family got up and moved that day.

Heavy Breathing and Other Strange Things Going On,United Kingdom,Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: Heavy Breathing and Other Strange Things Going On

I moved into my house 7 years ago and I first noticed things back then, I had just had a baby and before moving in my partner stayed in the house whilst it was being decorated, he used to tell me that the toilet flushed on its own and that he could hear footsteps upstairs (got to the point where he would only sleep downstairs).

A few weeks later myself and baby moved in, our house was fully decorated except for one room, which was to be the babies. I heard footsteps upstairs every night, sometimes running, sometimes stomping, not adult footsteps, sounded more like a kids. Then when I'd go to bed with the baby, I always felt something in my room, babies cot was just at the end of my bed and I could always sense there was something not right around it, I refused to put her in the cot, she slept in the bed with me and my partner. I'd wake up to feed her and always had the feeling of being watched, sometimes it was an ok feeling, sometimes it made me uneasy, it always came from around the cot.

Noises carried on in the other room, things would be moved and such, this died down when the room was finally decorated (my mum and I used to joke that the ghostie wanted a nice room), by this time my baby wasn't a baby, she was 2 and was now in her room with the new baby. I had baby monitors in there and sometimes we could hear talking sometimes giggling, I put that down to the monitors picking up on other things (I hope that's what it was anyway).

Noises seemed to have died down now but just before xmas last year, I was in bed (I am now in the room the girls were in) and I was watching tv, I heard breathing. Heavy heavy breathing, I muted the tv could still hear it, girls were at their dad's so it wasn't them, there was a breathing noise in my room and I was well spooked, I sat up in my bed and did the ""is anybody there?"" thing in the squeekiest voice you could imagine and sooo hoping I didn't get a response.

Then there was a weight at the bottom of my bed. I don't think I have ever moved so fast in my life. It felt like someone had sat down at the end of the bed, so I went downstairs and watched tv down there before deciding 3 hours later to go back to bed. I got in bed and listened, no breathing noises (phew) I'm just settling down into bed, close my eyes and bam it felt like a hand stroked my forehead. At this point I buried myself in the duvet and just refused to budge, whatever it was went away and I haven't heard anything like that since.

Other things that happen are things being hidden, things totally vanishing, you can be sat on a chair red hot when all of a sudden you just go cold, it lasts a few seconds and then your warm again.

I shall post more as and when it happens, but any ideas what the heavy breathing thing could have been as that really scared me.

A Token of Approval,United Kingdom,Family / Friends Visits,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Family / Friends Visits :: A Token of Approval

N ine days ago, on the 19th of september, I experienced something really strange! I live since four months with my fiance and his parents in their house in Liverpool, England. On the mentioned wednesday the 19th, I was on my own at home. My fiance and his family went out on a ride on their motorcycles and I decided to stay in.

After a hard day in work, I was looking forward to some peace and quiet including a good night reading. But before all that, it was time for a nice hot bath. I only wanted to relax and forget about my busy day. So I lit up some candles and made myself comfortable in the bath. At about 9 pm, after a good 15 minutes in the bath, I felt a chill even though the water was still hot and every window in the house was closed. And as soon as I stepped out the bath, wondering why this sudden breeze came upon me from nowhere all of my five candles went out in an instance for no reason.

I wrapped a towel around myself and made my way to my fiance's and my room, turning every light on, on my way. As I closed the door I gave a sigh relieve as I felt I was back in my safe place. I decided to discard my book and hit the hay, I turned out the light and got into bed. I knew my fiance and his parents won't be back before 11 pm and I had another busy day ahead of me.

As I lay there, drifting away, I suddenly feel how something or someone sits on the side of the bed and felt a hand resting on my left hand. I expected to discover my fiance next to me as I opened my eyes, but I saw nothing at all. After falling back asleep I got woken up before midnight, this time by my fiance!

He was asking me why the picture of his grandmother was lying on his side of the bed. I didn't know how it got there, it hung on the wall like always when I went to sleep. I need to explain that his grandmother died 4 years ago. And the next morning I heard of my fiance that she passed away in her sleep four years ago in our bedroom which used to be her's.

My fiance and me see it now as her approval from beyond the grave to our engagement five months ago. I wish I would have met her!

My Papa Said Goodbye!,"Florida, United States",Family / Friends Visits,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Family / Friends Visits :: My Papa Said Goodbye!

F riday, July 21, 2006, I was going to Wisconsin to visit my dad for a week. Now here's a brief history on that... I am 24, I never met my dad until I was 21, so this was the second time I went to Wisconsin to visit. My daughter was 11 months old, we stopped on our way out to see my Mom and Papa and say good bye, my Mom said that I needed to say ""Goodbye for good"". It was so hard to do, my Papa had been sick for about six years with dementia and eventually full blown Alzheimer. He was so sick when I was supposed to leave that I almost didn't go at all.

My family told me to go because Papa would want me to. I remember when I was little one time I asked him if he would be my daddy, he said ""I'm your Papa, but you do have a heavenly father"". I was very close to him, I went to church with him every Sunday when I was younger, and I personally feel that I was the closest to him of all the grandchildren.

Sunday, July 23rd, two days after we left my mom called and told me he had passed. I dropped to my knees and just cried uncontrollably. I was going to cut my visit short and go home for his funeral and to be there with my family. My mom asked everyone there (at the house where he passed) if they would have any ill feelings towards me if I stayed in Wisconsin for the rest of the week as planned, they understood that Papa would have wanted me to stay and get to know my dad and family up there. I had to make the decision to stay or go, I really felt guilty about it but I stayed, I should have been there going through the same thing everyone else in my family was going through. I was really sad and cried every time I thought about him and my family back home.

That night when I went to sleep I was dreaming about cars and people everywhere, I don't know it was weird, then all of the sudden, I was sitting in a chair and I saw my Papa, he walked around and sat in a chair across from me, sat and looked at one another for a minute and he says, ""Abby, I Love you!"" then he was gone and I woke up and cried. I know that was his way of saying goodbye! I felt a little more at ease after that but I still feel guilty that I wasn't there for my family.

I still have a very hard time talking about him, or in this case writing about him. I cry A LOT, I can't bring myself to go to his grave although I really want to.

This was really hard for me to write, I cried the whole time, so I hope you enjoy it.

My Sister's Loss,"Georgia, United States",Family / Friends Visits,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Family / Friends Visits :: My Sister's Loss

T his is actually the first experience I remember. When I was younger my mother and I went to town, did some shopping and got dinner on the way home. It was still light out, we were sitting in the living room with my step-dad eating and I heard the front door open and no so much slam, but when you shut that door, it rattled the tin roof, so you could tell it was open and shut. I heard it and I heard my sister say, ""Mom I'm home"" I thought it was strange because she was going to college in Brewton, Al, she lived in the dorms up there so she rarely came home to visit unless she had free time.

I ran to the other room to see her and the front door was closed and locked. I told my mom and dad what I had heard and my mom said that she was at work until nine that night and that she was going out with some of her girlfriends afterwards, so she wasn't expected home for the weekend. My dad looked at my mom with this look on his face, I thought he didn't believe me but I didn't understand why. After all he is the one who has most of the ""experiences"" in our family.

So we watch some t.v. and I go to bed. The next morning I woke up and my sister was there. I sat down with my mom and she told me that she had to go get her at like 2 or 3 that morning, I inquired as to why. She told me that one of her friends was in an accident. They were driving down a road that has a lot of bends in it on their way to a party. My sister and two of the girls were in one car and her other friend was in her jeep following behind them. They looked back and the jeep wasn't behind them, they were concerned so they turned back. The girls jeep was smashed into a tree and started to catch fire. The girl was conscious but her legs were pinned by the steering wheel. One of the girls broke out the back window and climbed in trying to pull her free. At this point my sister took the car to the store down the road to call 911.

When she got back the entire jeep was engulfed in flames and she didn't see anyone. She called out to her friends they had moved back into the edge of the woods to get away from the fire. My sister asked where their friend was, they couldn't get her out in time and she burned to her death. When she told me all this, I freaked out because I had a feeling about my sister and only hours later her and her friends went through this traumatic experience. My mom told me that while we were in town and my dad was home, he had seen a figure walk across the doorway and he didn't realize that it was my sister until I said that I had heard her. That is why he gave my mom that look.

It took me a while to realize that I had a significant experience and I think from there on out I was open to it and I still am.

One Night in Bachelor's Grove,"Illinois, United States",Photographs / Videos / EVP,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Photographs / Videos / EVP :: One Night in Bachelor's Grove

A couple of years ago me and some friends decided to visit the most haunted cemetery in the Chicagoland area, Bachelor's Grove. It is, indeed, a very haunted place. We brought a camera with us to take some pictures with the hope of capturing a few spooky things. The five of us wondered around for an hour or two in the pitch dark of night without a flashlight on hand (we weren't supposed to be there since the cemetery closes before sundown and we didn't want the authorities to find any activity out in the cemetery).

We all felt a lot of energy surrounding us. It was a depressing site to see though. Bachelor's Grove has been abandoned for years and there seems to have been a lot of disrespect done to the place. There was writing on some of the tombstones and garbage on the grounds of what's left for these souls to rest in peace on. Even though we didn't see anything, the energy we felt alone was freaky enough.

We took a couple of pictures and headed out to a long dark path down the road. As we almost exit the entrance, we all felt and heard something behind us so a friend decided to take a picture. He got them developed and discovered a misty ghost face in a grave that had been vandalized by a couple of punks a few years back. A bright lit orb was also caught right behind me as we all headed out the cemetery that night.

I guess what we all felt and heard that night wasn't just our imagination playing tricks on us after all.

A Bargain House that's Really No Bargain!,"New York, United States",Psychic / Medium,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Psychic / Medium :: A Bargain House that's Really No Bargain!

M y story begins when I was 17 and my family moved into a new house. My baby sister had just been born a few months prior so my mom and step dad wanted a bigger place. They never took my brother (he was 15 at the time) and I house-hunting so the first time I set foot in the house was the day we moved in.

My mother had bragged about the great deal they got on the place. Well, the moment I stepped across the threshold I understood why. The house felt very unwelcoming and I immediately got the sense that something horrible had happened there once. During the first weeks living there, I got more psychic input and pieced together what was going on in the house. A bit about the house layout: the front entrance of the house opens out on the right to a large living room/dining room combo. On the left, there is a hallway, and straight ahead is a sliding door leading to a sunken den and a Florida room that was added on later, not original to the house. At the far end of the den is the doorway to the garage. Down the hallway back by the front door is the entrance to the kitchen, the bathroom and my sisters room on the right, the entrances to my room, the basement and beyond it, my parents room are on the left side. The hall ends in a mirrored wall that would have been fashionable in the 1960's or early 1970's. The end of the hallway has a bad feeling and the mirror is creepy to say the least. If you are sitting in the living room you can see down the hallway and it feels like you are being watched. Often times I would be scared to look down the hallway for fear of seeing something there.

Now to tell you about the REALLY creepy part of the house, the basement. It is large, running the full length of the house. When going down the stairs, to the right is a short side with some storage and the washer and dryer. To the left of the stairs is the long side of the basement, which stretches back and ends in a part with a lower ceiling. There are some random shelves left by a previous owner, and nothing else in this part. My whole family would generally avoid this whole part to the basement but I never discussed with them why. From that part of the basement, I always got the feeling of being watched by an angry spirit, a man. There are also strange stains on the floor at the very farthest end by the wall, where the ceiling gets low.

The house has multiple spirits. I have never seen them, and only heard one of them: I once heard a little girl sneeze from the corner of the den by the garage door. I came to the conclusion that this was where the little girl used to try and hide from the man or escape from him out the garage door. I get a feeling of fear and sadness from the girl ghost, as if the man abused her and eventually killed her, I think in the spot at the end of the first floor hallway where it feels very bad. The little girl ghost seems to be mostly in the den. I cannot tell if she was his daughter or not. The man seems to mostly be in the basement. The other strange thing is that I can also feel fear there along with the man's anger and hatred. When I focused in on it, it felt like multiple dogs and I got a flash in my mind of a double row of kennels stacked one atop the other along the far wall. I believe that the man kept dogs locked up there and that he tortured and killed them. I can feel multiple frightened and confused spirits who can sense me back. It feels like they are wordlessly pleading for help. I felt sickened the day it dawned on me that this might be the source of the odd stains on the basement floor.

I never told anyone about these feeling and visions and left that house after only 8 months for my own place. I did not think about it again until recently. My baby sister who is now grown needed help taking care of my ill stepfather. So I found myself staying in the house with her for the first time in two decades. The house still has the same feeling to it and one night we were talking about how it felt odd and that parts of the house felt very bad. I had never told my sister anything about my experiences in the house. So I got a chill when my sister mentioned the man in the basement. I got wide eyed and gasped. This made her gasp too. She pointed at me and exclaimed, ""You can feel him too!"" I nodded, now thoroughly creeped out, and we proceeded to compare notes on our experiences.

I should mention here that most of the women in my family have some level of psychic sensitivity. My great grandmother, my grandmother, my mom, myself and my baby sister all were/are sensitive. I am also Wiccan and have trained myself to develop my abilities. My sister has no interest in such development but she is naturally very sensitive and intuitive. I often wondered why my mother could not feel the house as well. I think she did but ignored it as she was never really comfortable with her psychic abilities.

As my sister and I talked further, I noticed things she was doing instinctively to keep the male spirit at bay. The bad spot in the hallway is right in front of her bedroom door. Yet, my sister's room feels very safe and good. I think this is partly because my mother watches over her (our mother died when I was 20 and my sister 3). It is also because of my sister herself. She keeps a large white candle lit in her room whenever she is home. She also burns sage several times a week. And she does not know why besides she likes it, no one told her this might be a good ghost remedy either, she decided it on her own. She also mentioned that, growing up, she spent a lot of time in the Florida room and always felt safe there. This made sense because it had been added to the house later on, probably after whatever happened there. I was pleased to learn of my sister's habits and I assured her that she was doing the right thing to keep the bad spirit at bay. Also, she is very strong willed and is not a person easily messed with.

Sis next told me her experience with the man in the basement; that when she was a little girl she hated the basement. As she got older and started doing laundry, she remembers often being by the washer and dryer and being terrified to turn around because she could feel the man behind her, just a few feet away under the stairs, watching her. When she'd finished whatever she was doing, she would race back up the stairs, avoiding looking in the direction of the feeling. She also could feel the little girl ghost but not the dogs, though she sensed that something unspeakable had happened in the basement.

We got further confirmation when her boyfriend and his friend stayed over another night to keep her company while my stepfather was in the hospital. She did not tell her partner and his friend about the house for fear they would not want to stay. Still, they both felt strongly the bad feeling in the house. The friend was supposed to sleep on the couch in the den. But he felt so freaked out that he went out for some liquor and sat out in the backyard most of the night drinking and smoking, refusing to come back in the house and sleep until the sun began to rise.

I am not sure how to go about finding out if anything actually did happen in the house. Any ideas for how to look up such things as crimes committed in a house? I'd appreciate input here.

My sister and I have also talked more recently about trying to psychically cleanse the house but we hesitate to. My sister's energy has sort of put the bad man ghost in his place and he does not bother her now. We also have an ""if it ain't broke, don't fix it attitude"" toward him. We both feel clearly that he has a very strong attachment to the house so an attempt to oust the spirit might do more harm than good. Also, I read somewhere that you can ""distract"" a ghost by spilling birdseed or rice on the floor where the haunting is, that the ghost cannot resist counting the grains, but will loose count and start over repeatedly. We did this in the basement and it seems to have helped lessen the angry, threatening feeling in the house. Who knew ghosts had OCD?!

My sister plans to eventually sell the house, at which point we may have a priest come in and try a cleaning. If anyone has an opinion on that, please feel free to share! We are open to suggestions since my sister would feel guilty selling the house in its current state to some unsuspecting family.

The Figure Behind the Wheel,"California, United States",Demons / Possessions / Exorcisms,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Demons / Possessions / Exorcisms :: The Figure Behind the Wheel

L ast week, I went to visit my family in southern Wisconsin. My siblings and I are all in our late to mid-twenties and are married... so every chance we get, we gather at my mom's house for the weekend and just catch each other up with life. Usually on the first night of our get-togethers, it starts after dinner until 5 to 6 in the morning. We all just chat and play video games (Guitar Hero and the Wii, of course).

What interests us most were sharing real ghost stories - either what we've experienced or the experiences of close friends. This is the real story I shared: For years I've had nightmares right up to that weekend, flashbacks of me waking up to bright lights, finding mom arguing with dad, my younger brother Tony (who was 1 to 2 years old) was crying his head off, and seeing dad holding a rifle. Judging from my short arms and legs, I was too young to attend school and too old to drink a bottle. I believe I was about 3 to 4 years old. Then I remember mom carried Tony to the kitchen to get him a bottle. He was still crying his head off. Mom quickly got him a bottle because she wanted to quiet him down. The entire house was dark. The only source of light was coming from my parent's bedroom... I followed mom to the dark kitchen. I was in tears because my parents were arguing.

Dad soon joined the rest of us in the kitchen, still carrying his rifle. It was a humid, Californian night. After finishing Tony's bottle, I remember he was still swarming in mom's arms because the heat bothered him. Dad held his rifle to the window and scanned the driveway. What was he looking for? I looked toward dad's blue Volvo station wagon sitting in the driveway and something caught my eye. I saw a person sitting behind the driver's seat. I couldn't see who it was but I can see the outline of the person clearly because it was like a shadow that was darker than all of it's surroundings.

I was scared that the person might hurt my family. I looked at dad to see if he noticed the person behind the wheel. Dad didn't see anything because his eyes continued to scan the driveway. He was a Vietnam War Veteran, so the entire time it was as if he was at war... concealing behind the curtains and peeking outside to check on something. I pointed out the figure to him, ""Daddy, who is in the car?"" He looked toward the car, ""Who? I don't see anyone."" Dad had told mom of what I saw. He opened the front door to get a better look. While mom, Tony, and I were standing by the doorway, dad decided he wanted a better look at who it was and walked toward the station wagon. The figure sat quietly in the car. It was as if dad was looking right through the figure because he didn't see anyone.

All of a sudden the figure opened his eyes... I saw the pair of flaming red eyes looking toward the front door, our direction. Dad was standing next to the car, unaware of anything that's going on. I remember Tony pointing to the car, he saw it too. ""I see red eyes mommy,"" I said to mom. All of a sudden, the headlights of the station wagon turned on and that made dad jump, he ran toward the house and we all ran to the bedroom. The next thing I knew, it was morning. I went outside and saw my father washing his car. Maggots were leaking from the bottom of the car and were coming from the engine.

I never told a single soul of that nightmare until that day. I looked over at Tony, his jaw dropped and he turned white. ""You know what? I've always thought that was my nightmare. I remember seeing those red eyes in dad's Volvo station wagon."" It wasn't a dream?

Bits of details came back to the other siblings. My older sister said that night she remembered my parents burst to their room that night and slept on the floor. She heard the car horn honking throughout the night and not knowing what was going on because mom and dad had told them to keep quiet. My sister also recalls thousands of maggots coming from the car and it covered almost the entire driveway.

The next morning, I asked mom about the situation. At first, she didn't want to talk about it. She kept saying it's for our protection it's bad to know too much. Tony begged her. Mom said she's afraid to talk about it but only remembered minor details. She remembered prior to that night, Dad had dreams of his ancestors warning him about a demon, which was already a bad omen and he never told mom about it. That was their argument. Mom also said that night Tony and I pointed out that we saw red eyes but she and dad didn't see anything until the car headlights came on then they realized something was sitting in the car.

Finally 20 years after the incident, the nightmare came to a conclusion. I am no longer bothered by it. My father passed away before this was brought up. Mom still wants to keep hush about it. But as long as I know that it wasn't a dream...

Part of my Life in a Haunted House,United Kingdom,Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: Part of my Life in a Haunted House

I haven't told many people this but I think I'm ready to tell the people here, about 14 years ago in my old house strange things started to happen, but only small things, like feel something breathing on your neck, to things ending up in different places. Well as the time dragged on things started to get worse and while these things where happening, I also learned about the thing which was inside the house.

One night I was in bed and I heard my door open and footsteps stroll into my room. I looked up and thought nothing of it, then the footsteps got louder and stop at my bed side and this was when I first interacted with the ghost, since I needed my sleep because I was going on holiday the following day. I got up and I said 'Please Leave me alone GO AWAY' and I could then suddenly feel the feeling of relief because I could sense the thing was gone.

The house was quiet for a few weeks, then things started to get worse. One night I came up the stairs to see some Grey figure came from the bathroom across the hallway into my mother's room, she was dressed in old Victorian clothes which kind of looked like a nigh gown, that freaked me out even more because this was the first time I actually saw it in its real form, but something tell me that this wasn't the only thing in the house.

Later on that year the ghost was doing more strange things, such as running up and down the stairs, shutting doors, throwing things off cabinets, but as things progressed I learned something, what was happening is because of what we were doing. I learned that ghosts don't like objects to be moved or changed in anyways e.g moving a wardrobe or painting a wall, since when we did it, it angered the ghost. My whole family had seen it, but I saw it most since I was the youngest. They like to leech or pick on the most feeble of the family (easy target), we discussed to get the house blessed but we thought it wouldn't do anything.

And then something happened which struck me. One night I was sleeping and was woken up to find my bedroom in a mess, clothes and everything on the floor, and then it happened, I heard something run into my room and stop at side of my bed. I couldn't stop sweating, I was in terror, my bed started shaking and I could feel a cold thing striking me, hitting me through my body, it didn't hurt but it was such a weird feeling and at that moment, I knew I was being attacked from something which didn't want me here. I screamed to wake the others up, they dashed into my room and the following day, the house went up for sale. My body was covered in bruises, the bruises didn't hurt, they were just there, unfelt.

I moved into my brother's room until the house was sold. It was sold about a month later and we moved out. I don't know how much longer I would of lasted in that house.

I don't expect you to believe the events which took place in that house, I just expect you to listen and thank you for reading.

A Message from my Father,Bangladesh,Old Hags / Night Attacks / Sleep Paralysis,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Old Hags / Night Attacks / Sleep Paralysis :: A Message from my Father

T his story is about my mum. A few weeks ago her dad passed away - my granddad. One night she was thinking about him a lot. She slowly closed her eyes when suddenly she smelt arabian perfume (my granddad always wore that). She looked up but saw nothing.

A big gust of wind went past and she heard his voice saying ""help your daughters"". My mum looked over (my mum, me and my sisters sleep in the same room, my mum and little sister on a double bed and me and my older sister on a bunk bed) and saw a shadowy figure walking up to me and my sister. My mum shouted at it and it looked straight at her, it had no eyes, which freaked my mum the most. It ran to her and pushed her down on the bed. Then it put the covers over her and held her hands tightly. She couldn't breathe because of the covers over her and couldn't move her hands because that thing was holding them.

Me and my sisters woke up when we saw my mum struggling in her sleep. We woke her up and she told us what happened. My sister was trying to calm her down when we saw red finger marks on her hand - exactly the same place where it was holding her. My dad rushed upstairs to check on us. He said that he dozed off on the sofa when he felt someone run past him. He chased it to the other room but by the time he got there it was gone.

The Grave Yard,"Florida, United States",Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: The Grave Yard

W e all know that all grave yards are haunted in one form or another, but they also have a variety of sprites. This happened when I was about 15. My sister and I were going to hang out with a bunch of friends. Mind that we have always known about this place, but were told never to go there... EVER.

Our friends pick us up and we go to the grave yard, we stay for quite awhile, and it starts to get dark as it was, this place had a sense of foreboding. Well here we are having a blast when weird things start happening, some rocks start flying at us, we looked at our friends and told them to stop that they weren't funny, they said it wasn't them. So we went about our little tour and I happen across a grave that is from like the 1700s, wow that had to be the neatest thing I've ever seen. As I'm studying this grave I hear my sister and my friend chris scream bloody murder! So with flashlight in hand I start running to see what's going on, I stopped dead in my tracks when I looked to see what made them scream.

There in a big oak tree was a person hanging with the most horrible look on his face. You could see every detail of him from the noose to his shoes (which were very old). Then as we were going to the car to leave (at this point we had enough) a huge fog passed the car. This was one of the most terrifying night of my life! I will tell more about this place, because as a teen I didn't learn very well about what not to do. Now I don't go near that place at all, last time I was there my husband decided to be cute and prove to me that it runs from the road, it starts on to the main road (I already knew this).

He takes me through and I'm freaking out, I keep feeling like something bad is going to happen and the whole time I'm telling him this he's like ""no we're fine"". Well we got stuck in some deep mud! So I start praying my little heart out and saying the psalms, crying my eyes out the whole time. Now karma gets him, as I'm starting to see little clouds. He's outside of the truck and is trying to get us out when he jumps back in freaking out. ""What's wrong?"" I ask, his response was ""something grabbed me!""

He learned that night there was something wrong with that place. We don't even talk about it anymore. I hope every one likes this story. As for the grave yard, its ghosts were treated like really bad when they were alive so I guess that's why they linger still.

Bright Light,"New Jersey, United States",Orbs / Lights / Mists,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Orbs / Lights / Mists :: Bright Light

L ast night my husband and I were in the kitchen. I was facing him, talking to him. It was around 6 pm. All of a sudden this bright, bright light was shining in my eyes. I couldn't see his face anymore. It was there for a split second and then burst into little lights making a crackling and popping sound. It was like the flash on a camera only brighter. He had the same experience from where he was standing. We checked the lights in the kitchen and the rest of the downstairs of the house. Nothing was blown out. The light was blinding, it was so bright.

Last Friday, our new ceiling fan stopped working for no reason.

Last week, our new puppy was fixed on our headboard barking at something only he could see. He was barking and growling at the headboard. There was nothing that I could see there. When I put him on the floor, he just ran back up to the spot on the bed and kept growling and barking at something he was seeing. This was 3PM. Our bedroom is on the second floor, so it wasn't anything outside and we don't have a neighbor next to us.

About a month ago we were watching Taps. One of our printers (which we no longer use) turned on and printed out a blank page. The computer was not on and no one was near it. That was really eerie.

We have had other experiences in the past - a few years back. Stereo turning on for no reason in the middle of the night.

I am really becoming concerned that there is activity in our house.

A Touch of Darkness,"Washington, United States",Ouija Board / Seances,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Ouija Board / Seances :: A Touch of Darkness

O ne night me and four of my friends got together to play ouija. First we went to an unfinished house. With all the energy, the pointer was moving so FAST it was scraping the board. Whoever we talked to that night was a very nice man. We had to leave, but asked if we could continue talking to him later. He agreed, but that didn't happen.

We decided to play in a garage. We asked who was there and they didn't give a name. We asked for an age/sex. He said male/40. We asked ""why are you talking to us""... he replied ""young"". At this point we could all feel a very bad vibe. We asked ""do you want to kill us"", he replied ""yes,"" we said ""who""... he SLOWLY spelled A...L...L... We said ""ok we're leaving""... stupidly, he asked ""why""... we said ""uh, because you want to hurt us,"" and said good bye.

Later me and one other girl made her room pitch black and asked ""is anyone there?"" No reply... Then something GRABBED my leg under the blanket. I screamed bloody murder. After lighting the room and calming down, my friend got a sharp pain in her shoulder. It continued down her arm and across her forehead. Then to her ankle. She kept saying ""I feel weird"". She laid down. Her eyes started to roll to the back of her head. They would shut and she would sharply flinch. She continued to do so, barely saying anything. I was very worried, but didn't know what to do. I asked her ""is there anything I can do for you""... she replied ""there's nothing you can do"" (in a very creepy tone). Then one more time she flinched at me, but something about it wasn't right, and I screamed VERY LOUDLY again. When I screamed, whatever was inside of her, left. She sat up and covered her ears, not knowing what had just happened. We were so scared we cried.

At 4am, we sat there wanting to sleep so bad, but were too afraid to. We ask ourselves to this day, ""what was in that room?""

Strange Experiences at Night,"California, United States",Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: Strange Experiences at Night

H i everyone, I'm writing about some weird things I've experienced. They have all happened in my apartment, and usually around midnight. I've woken up around 12 o'clock a couple of times, and I once woke up at around 12:21 three times in a row.

One of these times, I woke up and since I was sleeping in the living room couch, I had a clear view of the bathroom. I was trying to go back to sleep when the bathroom light turned on! I got paranoid and looked around to see if there was anyone there. There wasn't, and I got freaked out good and forced myself to just go to sleep.

Another time, around 12, I got up to use the bathroom. Just as I was going back to bed, I heard a slam and turned around to see that a closet door in the hallway just going back into place.

And finally, another time, I woke up to see a black silhouette next to my bed move quickly away. After getting up, I quickly checked to see if it was my smaller brother, who was sharing a room with me. But he was sound asleep. I remember about the shape that it was completely impossible to see any details, and that it was soundless.

If any of you have comments, feel free to post them. I would appreciate any advice or shared experiences.

Papa's Warning,"Oregon, United States",Family / Friends Visits,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Family / Friends Visits :: Papa's Warning

M y grandfather died of heart related problems when I was 13. I was devastated by his passing, and didn't really know how to morn. I kept talking to him, (still do), kept him in my prayers and tried to move on. Some time after he died, I dreamt of him. He was wearing a blue suit (I've never seen him in a suit before), I don't remember much about that dream, I believe he was trying to convey he was all right.

A couple years later I dreamt of my Papa again, this time he had a warning, he said ""you need to go to the doctor, you were born with an illness and it needs to be addressed"" or something to that effect. When I awoke I told my mother and she said that it was just a dream and not to let it upset me.

I dreamt of him later on and he was at a pick nick with my grandmother and other living people. I was the only one who could see him. (He was always deceased in my dreams), and in this dream he asked me to check on my grandmother and make sure she wasn't too lonely as she has yet to remarry.

I still dream of him periodically. I have since been diagnosed with a heart malady but one that I'm told is not serious and can be treated with life time medication. I do visit my grandmother much more than I used to, and I know she appreciates it as she is very lonely. One more little interesting tid-bit, I went to visit my papa's grave, only I wasn't sure where it was, I remembered it was by a tree, but there are undoubtedly several trees at any given cemetery. I was on my search for about thirty minutes when I decided to give up, I had a long drive home, and I needed to get a move on. Just as I was turning to leave, I tripped over a headstone and fell onto my hands and knees, and low and behold who was looking up at me... My grandfather of course, his grave stone had his portrait etched into it, and there he was smiling back at me as if he had just done something mischievous which I believe he had, anyways I laid my flowers and left, chuckling and marveling over the experience all the way home.

Does anyone have an opinion on whether my grandfather's warning is beyond my mild medical condition?

I Never Got to Say Goodbye Mama,Sri Lanka,Family / Friends Visits,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Family / Friends Visits :: I Never Got to Say Goodbye Mama

H ey y'all, since I was little... I have been interested in paranormal happenings, my parents as well as my grand parents, uncle and aunt, are researchers here. My grand parents were CSI's here and most of their cases are about paranormal happenings. I know ghosts exist, because I have seen with my own eyes. I'm a very sensitive person when it comes to family and friends. So this story is about what happened the moment my mama was murdered. I'm 13 years of age now and I have no real dad or mama. I live with my cousins and my aunt and uncle (my mama's twin sister).

Probably all my friends say that I love to take risks and always end up lucky and that I love adventure, take it from me, I can't stand in one place for even 5 minutes flat. So my mama and dada decided to let me go to this camp out of the big, busy warm city and go to the cold part of Sri Lanka. On one condition, that my cousins and friends go with me. I was 11 at that time, it was the 26th of December, a hot day, it was 5 am, I hugged my parents and my brother (bleh, LOL) and we all said our last good byes. We sang and danced all the way to Nuwara Eliya and finally we got down from the bus.

I tried to call my parents but the connection sucked. So I just grabbed my bags and me and my cousins walked toward Mr. De Mel, he was the counselor in charge or something like that. I don't remember. We finally got a cabin and me and my 3 cousins managed to get into one cabin plus 2 of my friends (6 kids per cabin).

We all unpacked and we went out doors to explore. We found some really cool insects. It got dark soon, and Mr. De Mel called us into this big hall like place which was supposed to be the cafeteria. So we all had our dinner and then near the window, I saw fire flies, (I love fireflies). It was around 10 when everyone went into the woods with Mr. De Mel and Ms. De Vaz where there were these huge rocks. About 40 of us sat on low tree branches and rocks and enjoyed some songs, sherades and smores. It was loads of fun, then came ghost stories. Mr. De Mel says the best ghost stories. It was fun, then it was time to go to bed, but I didn't want to go to bed.

So me, along with my cousins and some new friends as well as old, got out of bed and caught fire flies in jars (we put holes in them so they wouldn't die) At around 2 am we all felt sleepy so we let the fire flies out, it was a beautiful sight. After that we forgot about our sleepiness and we all decided to stay up and watch the sunrise.

It was beautiful! You can't express it in words, it grew cold at around 6 am everyone had gotten up and we all went hiking on the mountains, with Mr. De Mel and Ms. De Vaz, it was great! We had breakfast at the top, there was only around 20 of us, because the others still hadn't woken up. LOL. They all had their breakfast in the Cafeteria. We walked a lot and Mr De Mel took a lot of breaks, which was a lot for an athletic 22 year old man, but the best part was that he always had a joke up his sleeve.

We finally decided to head back to camp at around 1 and we all had a wash and had lunch at around 3. Then at around 4.30 Mr De Mel sends a message to us through speakers built into every room saying that we're going to bathe in a place which he calls ""the ol' swimmin' hole"" Everyone squealed and laughed in joy and everyone soon got into loose shorts (we can't wear swimming suits because it was pretty cold). It was a 10 minute walk then we finally got there, it looked great! It was a lake full of clean water where you could see were your walking, it went pretty deep, but I could swim really well so we all had our chance to dive in from the deep end of the lake, it was hidden from the world, just surrounded by plants and trees; it was around 6.15 when we decided to head back to camp (oh yeah, and by the way, half the girls didn't come because they had fallen asleep after lunch LOL) As for me I hate to sleep in the afternoon.

It was a quiet night on the 27th of December, we were all very tired. So we had a quick dinner and got into our sleeping bags, the next morning, the 28th of December, was a very cold and gloomy day, it had rained at night. So we all put on our hoodies or sweaters and came out, Mr. De Mel said that we can go exploring today in the woods, (the best time to go exploring here, is after it rains and when the sun is out). It became a bit hot at around 10 am and we all set out to the woods. Mr De Mel said that we can go alone because it's not dangerous, so I began to wonder alone in the woods, because Mr De Mel gave us these things that were like party crackers except they go up high in the sky like fire works and he told us to use them in case we get lost. And for everyone to run towards it if anyone sends them off.

So I looked at the sky and the gray clouds had all gone away and it was a beautiful blue sky, I climbed up a tree which had pieces you could hold on to, I climbed up and I could see camp far away below the mountain. I saw this beautiful bird nest with 2 small ones which were light blue, black and lime green, they were so pretty. I soon climbed back down the tree and I turned back and started walking backwards looking back at what I had seen with my head up high, facing the tree where the birds were, I remember tripping and then falling head first and knocking my head on something really hard. I had got knocked out for a while; later on, I opened my eyes and it had gotten pretty dark. I got up and I felt the back of my head and it was hurting really badly. I turned around to see what had happened; I had tripped over a small rock covered by leaves and landed my head hard on a huge rock. Then I remembered that Mr De Mel and everyone else would have gone back. So I decided to walk and then it began to rain.

I was so upset, and then I checked my watch and it was 4 in the evening. I kept on walking, and all of a sudden I can hear this tree creaking. I soon realized that, the tree that creaked is about to fall down, I soon ran further, I had no clue where I was, it began rain very heavily and lightning, there was violent thunder. I ran in a direction I have no idea where. And then I ended up hiding under one of these bi trees. Then, all of a sudden, I can see this white figure from no where, I heard a female voice calling ""Shenny""; I thought it was Ms. De Vaz, she was far away, and I was so tired that I thought I couldn't make it. When I got closer to her, I realized that it wasn't Ms. De Vaz at all. Instead it was this white figure, she was pretty old, in her 50's I think, but she was pretty. I felt that I had seen her somewhere before, but I guessed I was imagining things. The figure pointed to her right. And I looked there and I could see Mr. De Mel, I think he was shouting my name but I couldn't hear because of all the rain, lightning and thunder. I looked back and the figure was gone, I still remember what she wore, a white saree and a cross in her hand. I checked my watch and it had stopped. The time was 5.48 and I was like, ""that's weird"".

I ran towards Mr De Mel and he grabbed my into his arms and we went back to camp, he asked me several times if I'm ok and I was getting worried. He patted the back of my head and he found blood on his hand, he said ""Shenny, you're bleeding..."" And I said ""Oh, it's ok, it doesn't hurt that much (It hurt like hell, but I didn't want to get anyone worried.) ""I'll be fine Mr. De Mel"" He gave a faint smile, and then we finally got back and I could see everyone outside and my cousins crying (Wow! This was the first time I ever saw them crying. 3 of them are guys and they're really tough, but this was like WOW!)

They came running to me and hugged me and started asking me all these questions. I said ""Guys, I'm fine!"" but they didn't believe me. Ms. De vas came running out into the rain with a rosary in her hand, she took me inside and I had a wash and I was covered in wounds, plus my head was still bleeding. So she put some medicine on my head (which was smarting to high heaven!) but I managed to forget about it. Then came the cuts on my hands and legs, they were pretty bad but I'm used to big cuts since I was really young. So eventually in the night we all forgot about it and enjoyed smores indoors with a cozy fire (fireplace) while it was raining outside.

I wasn't feeling that well so I decided to go to sleep, and then Ms. De Vaz said that I should sleep on her bed for the night. So I said ok and I took a framed photo of me and my mama, dada, and my brother, I kept it on the bedside table. It stopped raining then, so everyone decided to go out and tell ghost stories and stuff, but I stayed in and fell asleep, then I heard someone say Shenny. I thought Ms. De Vaz came to check on me, because it was a female voice. I opened my eyes and I saw the same white lady looking down at me. I couldn't scream, I tried to but nothing came out! She soon took my framed pictured and she broke the glass. Now, I was worried. She stared at the picture and then when I looked back, she was gone. That was so freaky. I tried to see if there was any logical explanation to all this, but there wasn't. The windows and doors were closed. I looked back at the picture. I held it close to me and I had soon fallen asleep. The next morning, the 30th of December, I can see everyone staring down at me and they all shouted, Happy Birthday Shenny! And I was like... ""It's my birthday today!"" Everyone laughed. It was 8 am and it was time to pack up to go back home. We all thanked the staff and hugged and said our good-byes.

Soon, me, along with my cousins, walked down the lane, we could see cop cars in front of our house. We looked at each other in fright,

I rang the bell and we waited until my butler (Walter) came to open the gate for us. He opened it and he hugged me with tears in his eyes. (We've known him since my big brother was born, so we trust him). He looked at my cousins and said, ""You're parents would like to talk to you"". And I asked him, ""Walter, What's going on? Where's Mama And Dada?"" He looked at me and said, ""Go speak to your aunt and uncle dear"". I looked at him for a moment and then walked towards my aunt and uncle, from a distance, I can see that there were 2 cops talking to them, soon they saw my cousins and they both jumped up and hugged and kissed them, I was still clueless about where Mama and Dada were. Then they saw me and they both ran to me and started crying, I could see my brother (I call him Aiya, it's brother in our native language). I called to him ""Aiya, what's going on?"" When he saw me he got up and ran to me, he hugged me for a while and I was waiting for him to let go, but he didn't, we were just standing there.

I pushed him away and said, ""Will somebody explain to me where my parents are please?"" No one answered. I tried to go inside the house and when I got to the door, the cops said I can't go in. I frowned at them, it was my birthday and why is everyone crying? And what are the cops doing here? I asked myself. I ran towards the garden where my dogs and puppies were. I went and I sat in the grass with my dogs, pretty upset. Then my aunt came and sat next to me. I looked at her, she was full of tears in her eyes. She said ""I'm sorry sweety, I completely forgot to wish you, happy birthday"" And she hugged me, I thought to myself (Wow, I know it's my birthday and all, but what's with the hugs? I never get so many hugs).

My uncle came too, and he wished me and did the same, I asked them again where my mama and dada were. He said, ""Shenny, this will be a lot to take in, but..."" (he was full of tears, and I had never seen any of my relations and family members cry like this)... ""Shenny, Emily was... was... she was... knife... heart... not good... hospital... dead...5 .48..."" That was good enough for me to run off down the lane and onto the road, soon my cousins caught me and I was screaming ""let me go! Let go!"" I had soon sat on top of the lane and started crying. (Now this was just shocking to everyone, because, never in my life have I cried in front of ANYONE. No one has ever seen me cry, unless when I was a baby)

My cousins got me up and made me walk back. Already my eyes were red and I was crying. I started coughing, I soon ran inside no matter who said what, and I ran straight to the bathroom and started vomiting. I couldn't stop. Finally everyone had come running in and were knocking on the bathroom door. I soon came out. And I just fell into my aunt's arms and started crying; we all went outside and I asked ""But what happened to Dada?"" My aunt said, ""Sweety, he left last night for New Zealand"". I looked at my aunt in shock and I ran back to the bathroom, I started to vomit again, and I didn't come out for quite a long time, then my uncle said, ""You and Aiya are going to live with us now sweety..."" I just jumped onto my uncle (he carries me around everywhere even thou I'm 12, he doesn't anymore thou) He carried me and I swear I could have filled a river because I was crying so much. I had fallen asleep in his arms, and he had put me into the SUV and we were on the way to their house, their house was just 5 minutes away.

I had woken up and they didn't realize. I said ""So when is the funeral?"". My uncle said ""Sweety I'm sorry but it was yesterday, and she was cremated, that was her wish darling, and after we read her will, you officially have the house and money to yourselves, and your father got half though..."" I was shocked ""So did Dada leave even a card saying good-bye?""...""I'm sorry hun, he didn't leave anything"". ""So he just left us?""... By reading my uncle's and Aunt's face, I could tell that they didn't know what to say... But I did... ""I can't believe Dada would do this to us, he said he loved us, and that he would never leave us. He's such a jerk...""

We soon got home, and I looked at the house; my aunt said, ""You don't have to live with us permanently, just for a week, until things are ok to go back"" Then my uncle said, ""Don't worry, we'll always be a phone call away. And Walter and the others will be there too"".

I got through the week and I got to see my mama's grave. When I got home, my dad called, and I said, ""Hi"" And then hung up, but later on I decided to talk to him... We keep in touch; what's weird is, that while I was typing this, my dad called. And he wants me and Aiya to migrate to New Zealand. We finally decided that we'll go. So at the end of November I'll be going.

Anyway, when I got home, I heard this voice saying, welcome back Shenny. And I was so sure that was my mama's voice. I checked the ground floor, and then the 2nd. I didn't go to the next 3 floors because I was too tired. So I went to my mama's bed, and I fell asleep. All of a sudden, I felt this rush of cold wind, the fan wasn't on, but the A/C was, but the A/C never comes directly from the right side to my left, I tried to make a logical explanation, but I couldn't, I soon fell back asleep.

Then, after that, I could feel someone sit on the bed. When I opened my eyes, there was no one, then I felt that some was twirling my hair, my mama always did that; ""Mama?"" I said. And then all of a sudden, a picture of my mama started to shake. And then the TV switched on. I was just to scared to spit anything out. But then it all stopped. And then the door opened wildly. I tried to scream, but nothing came out. I tried and tried, but it never worked. So I just closed my eyes, and then, when I opened them, I could see the white figure again. And she started to sing. And I just said ""Please stop!"" And she did; but she was still there... To be honest, I don't remember what happened after this, but since I saw that white figure, I told my aunt, (She's a researcher in spirits and what not) So when I told her, she had a white face, and she told me, ""The white lady is your Great Grandmother"" And I just said ""Wow...Seriously?"" And she said, ""Yes"" and she smiled.

Since that day, I've been seeing loads of other spirits. I go with my aunt and uncle almost everyday to check out old houses, or sometimes new built ones. Where we take pictures and after they've developed, we just freak out. I'll tell some of my recent experiences in some other stories.

Footprints of a Strange Visitor,"Arkansas, United States",Poltergeists / Physical Manifestations,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Poltergeists / Physical Manifestations :: Footprints of a Strange Visitor

T his is one of those stories passed down through the family, told by my father. He passed away so I can't ask him to clear any details, but I'll relate it as well as I can remember. My father's family, a couple of generations back, lived in Arkansas. They were very poor and I suppose they were what you could truly call 'hillbillies'. This was told to me by my Dad and happened to my great-grandparents.

They lived in a little house, surrounded by fields out in the country. They were self-supporting and just starting out together. My Dad's Mom wasn't even thought of yet. My Great-grandparents had just climbed into bed when there was a pounding at their front door. They worried because someone knocking at the door at that hour could only mean something was wrong. Remember, this would be around the 1890's. Early to bed, early to rise, no neighbors for quite a distance and no phones.

When they got to the door Great-grandpa called out and asked who it was. There was no reply so after asking a time or two more, they waited to see what would happen. When some time went by and they didn't hear anything, they went back to bed. They were pretty isolated so didn't want to open the door to someone who could be dangerous, a hobo, I suppose you could say. They were wondering what was going on, irritated but cautious.

This happened a few more nights, after dark, when they were in bed. I'm not clear on whether it was a few nights in a row or just sporadically. Nobody answered when they asked who it was. Great-grandpa was more than a little irritated and he was worried. He placed his hunting gun near the door in case he had to use it (that was the home security system in those days), though he didn't want to hurt anyone.

After this had gone on for a while, they started worrying about other things, things that couldn't be seen. They weren't closed minded to such things, after all there are plenty of 'hillbilly' superstitions. They came up with the idea to put a sprinkling of flour on the front steps to see what happened when they had the knocks on the door. Before too long, (I'm not sure if days went by, or what), the knocking started in the evening after they were ready for bed. Great-grandpa grabbed his gun (he wasn't a fool, just prepared for anything) and yelled out, asking who was there a couple of times. When there was no answer he put his gun at the ready, in case he had to shoot, and had Great-grandma fling the door wide open. There was no one there.

Great-grandpa called out but there was nobody in sight. They looked down and saw footprints in the flour leading up to the door and then just stopping at the door. Great-grandma said a little prayer, they were scared out of their wits. As far as I heard, that was the end of things knocking on their door.

My Dad was a great story teller but I heard him recall this story many times and it never varied. He always claimed it to be true. I believe him, (he is my Dad, after all!) and I don't think he embellished too awfully much (maybe not at all!) My Dad's sister, my Aunt, also claims this to be a true story.

The Transylvanian Spook,"Louisiana, United States",Non Human Entities,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Non Human Entities :: The Transylvanian Spook

I have had many supernatural encounters over the years, but this one is the most interesting. This story takes place in a little town called Transylvania, Louisiana in early 1993. Transylvania is located on Hwy. US 65 S, about 44 miles N.W. of Vicksburg, Ms. There are cotton fields all around in this region.

My boyfriend and I were on our way to our new home in Southeastern Louisiana. We had the car loaded down and our mutt, Barky (my baby sister named him), was sleeping in the back seat. It was early in the morning, about 2 or 3 a.m. I was drifting off in and out of consciousness, when I noticed signs along the road warning motorists that hitchhikers could actually be escaped inmates from nearby prison farms. I had never heard of a prison farm before, so I became curious and started a conversation with my boyfriend on the subject. According to Wikipedia, a prison farm is ""a large correctional facility where hard labor convicts are put to economical use in a 'farm' (in the wide sense of a productive unit), usually for manual labour, largely in open air, such as in agriculture, logging, quarrying, etc. Its historical equivalent on a very large scale was called a penal colony...""

At this point in the story, I was fully awake and engaged in a conversation that became even more interesting as we rolled into the sleepy town of Transylvania. We quickly noticed the huge water tower with the black bat and the word, ""Transylvania"". We cracked a few jokes about the spooky water tower, but other than the unusual name for a seemingly normal small southern town, the place was not eerie until we came upon something very incredible.

It appeared there was a man, a very tall man walking in the road ahead of us. It was a little foggy out, so I thought I might have been imagining it. As we came closer, we noticed that this was no man. It appeared to be some kind of creature I had never seen; it looked like some mythical creature, part human, and part buffalo. Its coloring was brown and patchy, and I could see right through it.

Suddenly, as we came within ten feet of it, the spook stepped directly in the path of our moving vehicle (we were probably going about 55 mph). My boyfriend slammed on his breaks and the dog went flying into the back of his seat and yelped. The beast slowly and nonchalantly turned his head sideways and looked at us intensely with despondent, hollow eyes, yet in an almost scolding look, then vanished. I got the definite feeling that this thing very purposely walked out in front of us with every intention of making us wreck.

About a month later, my boyfriend was traveling the same highway at night with a friend, whom he had told not a thing about the creepy supernatural beast we had seen in Transylvania. When they came into Transylvania, what did they see? None other than the same ""haint"" that tried to make us crash a month earlier.

I have not been able to find anything that would help explain what I saw when I was nineteen, until recently. It turns out, according to another ghost story website, this place is very haunted. There has been a body of a woman with a goat's head sited at the Transylvania post office many times. How interesting!

Reversal,"California, United States",Psychic / Medium,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Psychic / Medium :: Reversal

T here was never a time that I didn't sense beings. I believe everywhere is haunted with some being or energy, but the house at 1727 Verbena Way Reno Nevada, the house of my youth, was one of those places that could psychically sensitize even the most insensitive!

There was a male presence felt by my brother, my sister and myself. He was in the kitchen and we felt a sense of doom every time we ascended the stairs to the second story. My sister and I were left at home alone there one night, when were quite young. We were sitting at the table eating our TV dinners when a bowl and spatula were deliberately picked up from the counter and glided across the room to the table. We were frozen with fear and awe.

Eventually, my family moved because of work, and I was so happy, it was to Sacramento and I definitely felt life was going to get better. The first time we walked into our new house, in Sacramento on Kokanee way, I was personally overwhelmed, it was new and beautiful! My parents felt like they had done well in their purchase, buying it as a foreclosure, they had paid less! However, they had kept one secret from us kids. That when they had initially bought the house all looked normal and good until they went into the master bedroom and entered the bathroom. Blood was saturating the walls even the ceiling was streaked with red blood! And in the shower was the carcass of a chicken. It appeared to be a ritual killing. Likely, they killed the chicken to seal a curse upon the house and it's next tenants.

A few years later when I got told about this and then confirmed it with my mother, it seemed to echo my sense of that house, rather than alarm me. The house was active. One small example is the wall that refused to have pictures put upon it. I tried everything from tacky to tape to tacks, that is what held everything else up in my room. On that wall, however, nothing would stay. The pictures and holders would be on the floor before I could turn around. This pissed me off. So I decided to use a nail! Tapping the wall I located the stud then proceeded to hammer in the nail, then I hung up the picture. I walked away then turned my head back to see the most astonishing thing. The picture pulled laterally from the wall and for a moment I was worried it would fly across the room to decapitate me like the dead chicken. Thankfully, it seemed to descend deliberately, not fall, to the ground. My heart was racing, but I had to see if the nail was still in the wall, strangely it WAS still there. As I stood there examining it I laughed, bemused. Then the light went out with a snap, and absolute darkness and terror took hold of me. I threw open the bedroom door and ran out screaming my sisters name.

For along time I thought this was just my lot in life and never expected anything different. I accepted ghosts would always hang around and bother me. That was until I was a teenager. At about 17 my life was better than it had ever been. Despite horror stories about foster care, I happened to be in a foster home that made me feel safe and happy and hopeful! The next twist of this story will make a lot sensitive's want to rip my head off, but in the interest in honest reporting I'll tell you. My psychic ability towards everything else, beings, energies shifted. The shift was from having a Hubble macro scope to having a shield membrane that sifted out ambient energy and focused only on what would personally enhance me. This was a tandem shift too, the more safe and happy I became the less macro scope I was, and the more my psychic ability tuned down to just me and my interests.

After a good many months of enjoying this change I asked myself to shift back into ""macro scope sensitivity"". And I did. Strange, but true.

Whistler,Netherlands,Apparitions / Voices / Touches,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Apparitions / Voices / Touches :: Whistler

L et me start by saying I do NOT believe in ""ghosts..."" I will concede that the Earth is a diverse and mysterious place and we do not currently possess all the science necessary to understand much of it. Consider briefly how far we have come in the last century alone, how many of our misunderstandings are now known and how much of the mysterious has become almost mundane. Lighting is a meteorological effect and is not the result of angry deities, for example. I am a rational, highly educated 29-year old male from the United States. We have a rather limited amount of history in the ""New World"" and put a premium on science. I do not believe that the dead can return to Earth to interact with the living.

That said, I have no idea what happened to me last week in Holland. And now I wonder what I REALLY know.

My girlfriend and I checked-in to an old hotel on the outskirts of Amsterdam on Monday night, September 24, 2007. We had the room for two nights and planned to leave for Schipol Airport on Wednesday morning for a flight to Prague, Czech Republic. Monday night passed without incident, as did most of the day Tuesday. It was not until about 11:30 PM on Tuesday night that something occurred, the root of which I cannot explain.

We were packing-up our bags so we could check-out quickly in the morning. She was packing hers on the far side of our small 7 foot by 12 foot room. I was near the door packing mine. As I bent down to shove some clothes into my bag, I experienced a jabbing sensation on the right side of my back near my kidneys. It felt as though four fingers or blunt, prong-like rods or something poked into my back. Hard. And I mean with unmistakable force. I leapt up and wheeled around I was so surprised. I don't know what I expected to see, but there was nothing there. There was nothing even close by that I could have backed into except for the door and it was a good meter away from me. My girlfriend noticed that I jumped up very quickly and how startled I was looking around myself. She looked at me and asked what happened. I didn't want to scare her, but merely told her I thought something poked me in the back. She looked at me skeptically, but knows how logical I am and went back to packing. I tried to rationalize it as just in my mind, but this was difficult as I have zero doubt that I was deliberately and distinctly touched by something with force significant enough not to be disregarded. At any rate, we had to rise early, so I put it out of mind and we went to bed.

We had been given (much to our chagrin) a room with bunk beds. She slept on the top while I took the bottom bunk. I put in my standard earplugs I take traveling with me and we were soon asleep. But not for long. At about 2 AM, as I was sleeping on my right side, I felt something flicking at my left ear. I thought it was a bug of some sort and sleepily brushed at it without raising my head. Within a few seconds, something again flicked at my ear. Now I was wide awake because I thought there might be a cockroach or something on my pillow and the thought disgusted me, so I sat up and looked around. There was no insect. I laid back down on my right side and placed the right side my head on the pillow to try to sleep.

Immediately, something touched my ear again and this time, without raising my head, using my left hand, I pulled my earplug out of my ear. Absolutely immediately, within less than a second of having dislodged the plug something whistled LOUDLY in my left ear. It was as if someone's mouth was an inch or two away from my ear and whistled right into it with gusto. I could tell that it was organic in nature because it was not a perfect tone, that is, it was not manmade like an alarm or an electronically produced noise. It was imperfect, as if someone was whistling with lips too dry to make a good seal. It was a three-tone tune that I will never forget. I do not understand octaves, but suffice to say it went from high to low. And it was loud, very loud, so loud that if you were concentrating on something and a prankster friend snuck up behind you to whistle in your ear, it would make you jump. But I didn't jump; I froze. Solid. For about a minute. Sheer and absolute terror coursed through my body. I did not breathe, I did not move, I could not cry out.

I tried to call my girlfriend's name, but the words would not come. Finally, after about a minute (which seemed like an eternity) I mustered up enough vigor to say her name. On the third try, she awoke, startled, sensing the fear in my voice, ""What is it, babe?!"" And what could I say but, ""Um, something just whistled in my ear. Really, really loudly... Can you please come down here and get in bed with me?"" She complied and we proceeded to put two and two together. Whatever pushed me earlier was toying with me now. Again, I'm a 29-year old guy who goes camping without flashlights and teaches high school in a tough neighborhood in Brooklyn, New York -- I am not a push-over. But here I was asking my girlfriend to get into bed with me because I'm scared of something I cannot understand. I'm hesitant to use the word ""ghost,"" but I just don't know how else to describe this encounter.

But this encounter was not over. After about 20 minutes, she was asleep, but sleep eluded me and would not return. That's when my previous fear grew to epic proportions. Suddenly, I heard the whistling again, but fainter and out in the hallway right outside our door. This time, the three tones were following by several more so that it made a little song that I didn't recognize as anything formal. It was just as if someone was whistling a tune they were making up. It contained long and short tones, high and low and was quite varied. I heard it go from one end of the hallway to the other. There was nobody else on our floor that night. At this point, I was petrified. I have never been so scared in my entire life. It was sweltering under the covers with her, but I dared not expose anymore of my body than necessary due to extreme fear. These are the emotions and thoughts of a small child, but there I was, a grown man, scared of the dark.

After about another half hour or so (the parallax of time was confusing at this point as the seconds dragged by agonizingly slow) I realized my mouth was dry from nervous energy. I looked for our water bottle which I had sat over to my left when we got into bed. This was the exposed part of the bed since the right side was flush against the wall. At first, I could not make-out what I witnessed. What I saw was a milky figure blurring the area between my bed and the desk on which my girlfriend's backpack was resting. I knew our water bottle was on the desk with other traveling acutrements, but I could not see them clearly due to this mist. I sat up slightly and peered very hard and it looked almost like a wrinkled shower curtain between us and the desk, which was no more than a meter from the bed. It then dissipated and I could then clearly see the contents of the desktop. Suffice to say, I did not sleep the rest of the night. Eventually, she awoke at about 5:30 sensing that I was not sleeping and asked if we should just check-out then. I don't need to tell you my reply. We were headed for the airport hours early and glad to be out of that room.

That was a week ago today and I am still very shaken. I cannot explain what had happened to me that night and cannot wrap my brain around it. For a moment, I wondered if this was the commencement of dementia. I was questioning my very sanity, and it hasn't stopped there. I am now questioning everything I think I know about physics. I live alone and have never been afraid of the dark or anything like that. Now, I am almost constantly ruffled. We returned to the States last night and I am sleeping at my girl's place tonight. Eventually, I will have to go back to my apartment alone, but am wary to do so. I am not sure I will never feel the same.

Can anyone shed some light on this situation, please? I cannot state adamantly enough how honest I am being here. I have no reason to lie and am looking sincerely for answers.

New Office 3,"Nebraska, United States",Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: New Office 3

I had promised I would keep everyone updated that read my last 2 storied regarding my new office. For a couple of days, things were going okay. I was still hearing the whispered conversations as I opened the door. I was still being tapped on the shoulder, but I chose not to respond any longer to these happenings. There is no way anyone in this office will let their be an investigation, even if promised the utmost anonymity, it is not going to happen.

I have not been able to perform the smudge ceremony yet as I have not found the office alone enough for me to complete.

Yesterday evening was one for the record books of frightening in my life. Whew! I was packing up my brief case to leave for the evening (work-a-holic). I was placing the documents I need to work on along with a few books for reference when I heard a whispered male voice in my right ear, away from the door. The whisper said; I want to come with you"". I stopped loading my brief case, hand goose flesh on my arms and looked around. Nothing. I emphatically said ""No, no one from my place of business ever joins me at home. It is a rule of mine.""

I completed the task of loading up my brief case with needed items. I then remembered I had brought a salad for lunch and went to the kitchen to retrieve my containers. As I have mentioned in my previous stories, walking away from my office without securely locking the door is grounds for termination. So, I pulled the door closed and tried the handle. Locked up tight. I went to the kitchen, grabbed my bowl and utensils and went back to my office.

I turned the key in the lock and noticed immediately that the lights had been turned off. Okay, maybe I could have flipped the switch without thinking about it, but I know if did not pull the chain on the desk lamp! I turned on the lights and went to my brief case to place my lunch ware in the case to take home. All of the data, paper work and books I had just packed in there no more that 3 minutes prior were stacked into 3 neat little piles on the floor. 2 piles where on the left side, 1 pile was on the right side. I went to the brief case and looked down. Not only was it securely zipped, it was also latched with the key lock. I do not use the key system unless traveling because of the hassle.

I went to my purse and got the key, opening the brief case. As I opened it and unzipped it, there was a hug whoooosssh sound, almost like letting the air out of a giant balloon. I replaced all of the items in the brief case and closed it back up, this time choosing to lock it. As I left , I was pulling the door closed after shutting of the lights and I hear very clearly 'DAMN, WE GOTTA GET OUTTA HERE!' this was spoken so loudly, the CFO from around the corner came up to me and said, 'Who was that and what is going on?. I tried to explain some of the occurrences; he just kept shaking his head no and said he had to leave.

Today, at least 10 times I hear whispering conversations as before, then they are punctuated by a deeper male whisper saying, ""Damn, we have to get outta' here'. I have tried telling them to cross over. As a matter of fact, I tried that many times today. The responses I got before was nothing. Today I am getting -'Shhh'.

What a mess. The drama continues and it is making it harder to concentrate. I worked for about hour and a half in the bard room just so I could get some things done!

Was It the Min Min Lights?,Australia,Orbs / Lights / Mists,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Orbs / Lights / Mists :: Was It the Min Min Lights?

T his is a story that my dad told me that happened to him many years ago. He was out Roo (Kangaroo) shooting with eight of his friends on a large property in South West corner of New South Wales, it was about one or two o'clock in the morning so still very dark when one of the guys gun seized up or something, so they stopped the ute so this guy could go around into the head light and try and fix it.

While the others were waiting they saw something that not one of them could explain a large ball of light appeared and bounced across the ground around them completely lighting up the whole area as bright as day then it just bounced off into the bush. Out of the nine there, eight of them saw it, the only one who didn't see it was the guy fixing his gun in the head light.

A day or to later the story of this strange light had got around town and from there ABC news found out about it and reported a story on it. Most people say that it was the Min Min* light but it had never been reported in this area before and never since but all I know is not one of the guys have been back to area since and not one of them will go again.

*Min Min light is mysterious Australian outback phenomenon best known manifestation of the Australian ""ghost light"" genre is the famous Min Min Light. Hundreds of people over the years have told of seeing the Min Min Light in the Boulia or Winton district (this is about 2000 kilometers from were my dad and his friends saw the light). It has been reported high in the sky, at times oscillating up and down like a yo-yo. A frequent feature is that, unlike a headlight, it lights its surrounds on all sides. It appears to be a curious, friendly light, often approaching but never threatening, although at times causing panic in the minds of the beholders.

If you talk to old timers out there who had seen it and they were terrified by it, it's a bit embarrassing for them because hardened outback men can be brought to tears by this thing. It really is quite alarming.

The Old Man in a Wheel Chair,Sri Lanka,Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: The Old Man in a Wheel Chair

T his happened to me just a few days ago, I would have posted it earlier but I didn't have enough time. Me, along with 3 of my cousins, plus my aunt and uncle (they're researchers in paranormal activities here) went to check out this old mansion, the couple living there said they heard noises, always late at night; So they called my aunt and uncle and told them to check it, and of course, me and my cousins joined them. So we set off for the mansion at around 5 in the evening, it was out of town, so it took about 1 and a half hours to get there.

When we got down, we saw the mansion, and the couple outside; I assume they've been waiting for us; they had about 2 carry bags each, they were about to leave for a few days until we figure out what's going on. We got the keys to the mansion, it was beautiful! An old fashioned house, we said good-bye to them and we walked in, Hello, antique freaks!

The house was like an antique shop! Everything to match, pretty cool. I checked my watch and it was almost 8 pm, my aunt and uncle took up a lot of time talking to the Fernandez couple. We explored the house; (sounds just like me doesn't it?) And finally we got bored, because we couldn't play around since the house was full of ornaments!

It was almost 11, so we decided to sleep, we slept in sleeping bags, because it would be awkward to sleep on people's beds like that. My aunt and uncle were doing some research on the house on the net, in the next room. So we said night night and went to sleep.

Then after 5 minutes we felt restless, we couldn't sleep; we all felt like there was something wrong. Then tapping noises started, then it became louder and louder, then from the tapping, it was banging, louder and louder, by this time we had all run to the next room and my aunt and uncle were a bit worried, then from the next room (the 2 rooms were connected). We could see the door opening, and some kind of mist... The door was locked!

I walked towards the door that was opened. (I don't get scared that easy). What I saw was just... not good. I started saying ""Ok, not good. Not good"" And walked backwards away from the door. Then all of a sudden I just froze; just completely shocked; I saw an old man with a beard, almost bald, in a wheel chair. And the figure came closer and closer to me, he was staring at me with wide open eyes with his head tilted to the right, that was a sight! The wheel chair had this eerie noise from it. Like one of the nails were loose or something. It came closer and closer, it made its way through me! NOW, I was freaked out! It felt like a cold wind go through me, VERY cold, and it gave me goose bumps like I've never seen. I had fallen flat on the floor, blacked out for a while.

When I woke up, I was on my sleeping bag. With my cousins sitting around in a circle. A few feet away from me. Everyone looked at me and I was like, ""Ok, I'm lost big time"". And one of my cousins said ""Dude, are you ok?"" ""Yeah I'm fine"" I said.

The next morning the couple arrived, and we told them what happened, and what he looked like. And they told us that the man that sold the mansion to them said that an old man died in his wheel chair in that very room. And now he's just making sure that the couple knows that he's present in the mansion. They told us to stay just another night, and then when the noises started, we decided to pray. The noises stopped. Now the couple pray every morning and night before going to bed and as they wake up. And no more noises. TA DA! But I'll never forget the feeling of that old man going through me.

My Grandparents' House is Haunted,"Colorado, United States",Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: My Grandparents' House is Haunted

O nce my mom and her then boyfriend split, we went to move in with my grandparents, in Redlands, California. I lived there a few years before and had noticed weird things going on in the house. Of course nobody believed me. So I basically just kept it to myself.

There would be times when I would be alone watching TV and I would hear footsteps upstairs in my grandparents room. Just walking back and forth. After a while It was annoying so I called out ""Who's there?"" And of course the footsteps would stop. I just brushed it off.

Another time I was in the kitchen making something to eat when I saw someone run into the office. Thinking it was my grandma, I called out for her, but when I got no response I decided to check it out. Nobody was there. At night I will usually hear someone walking up and down the stairs. The footsteps won't stop unless you say something out loud.

Another time I when I was younger, I was in one of the rooms playing Nintendo, and from the corner of my eye I saw a lady in a white dress on the balcony just staring at me. After I saw that I ran like a fat kid running to a buffet line. I told my mom but she just ignored me and said it was my imagination. So I shrugged my shoulders and resumed playing my game. Only after a few minutes I saw her again. After that, I never slept in that room again.

One of my scariest experiences was 3 years ago. I had come home late, around 2 in the morning, from hanging out with some friends. I walked up the stairs and went into my room. My dog Madison was waiting for me and I played with him for a few minutes. All of a sudden I heard the sliding door open from the room next door and then some footsteps. My dog then started to bark at the wall leading to the other room. I figured it was my grandma closing the balcony door so I went to say hi to her. But once I opened the door the room was pitch black and the sliding door was shut and locked.

I ran back to my room and turned on the radio, TV, and slept with the lights on. The next morning I had asked my grandma if she was in the room next to mine and she told me she hadn't gone in that room all day. I was pretty freaked out after that.

I now live in another city but I still work in Redlands so when I'm too tired to drive home I'll just sleep at my grandparents house. A few weeks ago I went there and slept on the couch and I woke up about 4 times because I kept hearing footsteps when it was just me in the house.

That's pretty much it, sorry if my story was as long as a novel.

My Nan,Australia,Family / Friends Visits,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Family / Friends Visits :: My Nan

M y nan died when I was a few months old. So I never actually met her. One night I was asleep when I heard my name being called out, I woke up with a fright. I sat up ready to get out of bed so I could go into mum's room down the hall because I was scared when I saw something at my door. I thought it might have been a robber so I laid back down quickly and covered my head with my sheets.

A few minutes later I wanted to see if the person had left so I peeked out from under my blankets and it was still there. So I just stared at it hoping it couldn't see me. I realized it was a lady, she had her arms crossed like she was mad staring at me, not moving. It was obvious she wasn't alive. I quickly closed my eyes hoping morning would hurry up and come.

I didn't told mum straight away because I didn't think she would believe me until a few months later, we were talking about ghosts and I told her. She told me to give her a description so I explained that the lady had her arms crossed a dressing-gown on with the last three or so buttons open near the end of it and mum said that it was her mum. I guess my nan had unfinished business that night because I have never seen her again.

Why would she have stood at my door why didn't she come closer to me?

The Piano,"North Carolina, United States",Misc,"M e and my friend Adam were at his house one day in a city called Hickory. It was his mother and father's house. They've lived there for awhile, everything seemed fine, it was a nice little house. On this day, it was around lunch time and we were just sitting there chatting to each other, we talked for a little while then we heard a knock on the door, Adam got up, answered it, it was his girlfriend, by this time now it's around 4 pm.

We decided to go to his bedroom to play his playstation 2, so we all went in there, it was a little room so I was on the bed, he was sitting in the floor and she was sitting in a fold down chair, now let me remind you that there are only three people in this house, one cat, one dog. Adam has a brother that has cerebral palsy and his bedroom is right next door down the hall. We were sitting there playing this Air combat fighting game, we were all taking turns playing the game, then his bedroom door came open, it was his cat named lilly, she hopped on the bed. I petted her for a few seconds, she got down and left the room.

We continued to play our game, then all of the sudden we hear a faint noise that was louder than our game, I turned to adam and said ""did you hear that"" adam replied ""I think I heard something"", his girlfriend was sitting there in disbelief, she said ""I heard it"". I turned the game off and everything got quiet, we sat there for a few moments then out of no where, we heard this beautiful music coming from a piano, we all looked at each other, I said ""adam is your brother home?"", he said ""he don't get home until after 6"", I looked down, he had a bat sitting beside his bedroom door, I grabbed it and clenched onto it, he grabbed a sword off his wall, we proceeded out his bedroom, we looked down the hall, it was coming from his brother's bedroom, we looked at each other, then looked down the hall.

The door was slightly cracked, we got to the door, the music stopped, it was pitch black in his brother's room, Adam says ""nathen are you in there"" no one replied. Adam got a concerned look on his face, he raised his foot and kicked the door open quickly, flipped the light on... No one was there. Now his cat was sitting on the little stool at the keyboard player, she looked up at us and meowed. Now we were hearing something like mozart or some thing, I looked, the thing was turned off and it was unplugged, so until this day we still don't know what was going on, it was freaky.

Grandad's Rocking Chair,United Kingdom,Family / Friends Visits,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Family / Friends Visits :: Grandad's Rocking Chair

I 'll start by telling you about my granddad, he died in 1985 I think and he had a rocking chair which my gran kept until recently, a few months ago she gave it to my dad and my step brother put it in his room. I go see my dad every week or so depending what I'm doing. He had said a month or so ago he woke up in the middle of the night and he saw someone sitting in the rocking chair, a dark figure that turned around and looked at him. Then he said he fell asleep and was woken again later by someone trying to pull his covers off, so he pulled them up and fell back asleep. Then just the other week he said that he woke up because he felt someone's hand on him above the covers on his shoulder and waving around above his face, he was kind of half asleep, he thinks, and he was trying to swat it away, then he fell asleep.

Well that's what happened to my dad and what he told me. Now I'll tell you what happened to me. It was a week or so ago and I was sleeping in the bed my dad had when he saw what he saw, not while he was sleeping in it. I got in bed and was on my phone texting people and then I put it down and closed my eyes for a bit and couldn't sleep, so I turned around. My back was facing the wall, I looked towards the rocking chair and there was a dark figure sat there, not looking at me, I think, looking forwards. I ducked under the covers a bit and rubbed my eyes, I looked back up and it was gone.

That's my story, it may not be as interesting or as exciting as some of the other ones, just wondering what you guys think.

I Heard my Name in the Most Awful Way,"Texas, United States",Apparitions / Voices / Touches,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Apparitions / Voices / Touches :: I Heard my Name in the Most Awful Way

I was about ten, and I used to live in a small town called Uvalde. It's a good place to rise kids I guess, nothing real major really happens there. I was with my friend Rigo on my front porch shooting water guns at the dark. We were playing the army stuff ""die you evil monster"" kind of thing. Well we must have struck a nerve. I went inside to refill my water gun and Rigo came about ten seconds after, so I ran outside as fast as I could so I could hide and wet him. I hid behind the fence that divided our houses with a huge pecan tree hiding the moonlight. As I saw him come outside, he turned away real fast as if someone called him and ran inside.

I looked at him through the glass door that we had, as I was walking up the sidewalk, and he started to come back outside so I took off to hide. As he was standing there I began to laugh because I knew that if he didn't find me he would go home and have to walk right passed me and I would wet him. Just then I heard my name in the most awful way that you could hear. It sounded like some kind of demon talking to me. I took off to the porch where Rigo was standing and he asked me if I had heard something? I said my name.

Just like two chickens we ran inside and told my sister and she looked outside as if there were someone there, so she could believe us. I closed the door and we talked about what happened, wondering if it was the BIG D calling us. As I was growing up we were always told if you weren't inside by a certain time, that he would come get you. And I tell you what, being a hispanic and having your grandmothers and aunts and uncles tell you stories about what happened to them, we have no choice to believe.

In the end we never spoke about it for fear that it might happen again. Could it have been IT? You tell me. I hope you enjoy

I Felt the Hand of a Ghost Girl,United Kingdom,Apparitions / Voices / Touches,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Apparitions / Voices / Touches :: I Felt the Hand of a Ghost Girl

O n a typical winters night back in 1976/7, when I was just 6 years old, I would stay up playing either in my bedroom or my older brothers' bedroom most times when we should have been in bed. We lived in a dorm bungalow, our bedrooms were in the roof. Our doorways facing each other with stairs and landing separating us.

That night, my dad had popped out and my mum was in the bath down stairs. Leaving me and my brother to play Lego on his bed for a while before we got into bed. I remember my brother telling me he was off to the loo (downstairs), which left me to play by myself for a very short while. Within a minute or so of being left on my own, I walked away from the bed across the room to the window. As I walked past my brother's bedroom door, something caught my eye across the landing.

There stood a girl in my bedroom doorway, about my age. She had a blond bob style hair cut, and wore a tartan skirt with a white vest attached to it. She looked very pale and dark around her eyes. She looked sad, which made me feel sad for her... I didn't know who she was or where she came from but wanted to make her happy. So I approached her. Feeling a little awkward I passed her and walked into my bedroom. I sat on the floor and folded my legs, she copied me. She never muttered a word.

""What do I do"", I thought, I started to sing a song I'd learned at school hoping she would join in. She didn't, she just sat and stared at me. I started to feel scared. I reached out to hold her hand, she felt icy. I startled her, she quickly stood up and moved to the doorway and I quickly followed her. She started to walk down the stairs, within a couple of steps she just seemed to zoom down them. The further she went the faster she went. Her body echoed as she went. Then disappearing through the living room wall at the bottom of the stairs... I stood in shock staring at the wall for a few moments. But do not remember anything after that.

I was terrified, call me naive but at that age I didn't know what a ghost was. For more than three decades I've told people about what happened that night... I wish I could find out who she is and why she came to me. The bungalow itself was built about 20 years before hand and the loft was built when I was 3 years old... a mystery!

The Halloween Cat,"New York, United States",Pets / Animals,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Pets / Animals :: The Halloween Cat

T oday, as I'm typing this up, is October 3. This is twenty eight days before Halloween, which many of you ghost hunters are waiting for. Now... some of you, who believe in ghosts, but are not scared by Halloween, should listen to what I am about to say.

There is a ghost flying around my elementary school on Halloween. I told my fifth grade class three years ago about this boy who died near a house that was down the block from the school. He now walks around, not as a spirit, but as a black cat. In my elementary school, there is always, like a few days before Hallow's Eve, a Halloween party for the kids. When my friends and I went to the bathroom. We heard a meowing and scratching on the window. Next thing you know is that all the girls are running and screaming out of the bathroom, except me. I have been believing in ghosts since 2003. That was when this huge black out happened and I saw something, but that's a totally different story.

I was kind of freaked out because I made the whole story about the boy dying all up. Before I left the bathroom, something strange happened. I walked out, and the next thing I knew was that I was in the hallway near the front entrance. I don't really know how I got there, because I was right in front of the bathroom door. My friend ran outside and asked if I was feeling better. This is how our conversation went:

Friend: ""Are you ok Alyssa, you were acting totally weird a couple of minutes ago...""

Friend: ""Yeah, you were screaming and chasing us around the gym...""

I was shocked. I didn't remember anything. I think that ghost boy got into my body and took revenge on me for telling his story.

Now I'm telling you this story because I don't want it to happen again. You see, in my middle school, there's this thing called ""National Junior Honors Society"". Which is a thing in my school that puts all smart kids to volunteering work. I volunteered, today, to work at that same party at my elementary school. I'm a little scared because what if that whole thing, with the ghost kid, happens again. Would it? Could it? Would he remember me? Is he still there? I really need some advice. Help me. Please.

I Didn't Know He Was Gone,"California, United States",Family / Friends Visits,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Family / Friends Visits :: I Didn't Know He Was Gone

S tory behind the story: since I was 4 days old, I have lived with my paternal grandmother and her husband. This man, he became my best friend, we just had a bond that was untouched. This man (Roger) had a daily routine, up at 4am in the shower and out the door by 6am for his trip to the coffee shop, the grocery store, and the news paper stand.

Every single morning, before he left, he would wake me up and tell me ""take out Mimi (our silky terrier) and feed her when you wake up"". Roger in the year 1998 met his demise, of course it was only known to his wife & himself of his sickness (Colon Cancer) the rest of us were in horror to hear ""he's past"" (august, 5th 1998)...

Story: It was august, 6th 1998, I had awoken to the sound of a shower (I was sleeping on the couch in the living room). I walked down the hall to the bathroom, and of course to my dismay, there wasn't a shower running nor was the bathtub even wet (I did check) after this, I went to the kitchen for a bottle of water, I glanced at the microwave and saw it was about 4:07am (I don't know the exact time but I remember it was between 4am & 4:30am). I don't think nothing of it so I go back to sleep. Shortly after I'm awaken by someone shaking me. I turn around and about 2 inches away from my face was Roger, I just stared in amazement (this man died in a hospital bed not more then 6 or 7 hours ago) ""take Mimi out when you wake up and feed her, I'll bring you some goodies back"" his voice was so real, he was so real, I thought it had to be a dream. He walked towards the door, as I watched I heard the door open and shut but didn't see it. I quickly ran to the window, heard his 1970 Cadillac start up, I saw the fog from him warming it up in the chilly morning as I heard it back up (not seeing it) he just vanished.

He had always told me he was my guardian angel... Now I guess he really is.

About a week after he died and my first encounter with him, subsequent to his death, I saw him again only this time it wasn't towards me. I had ran in my nana's room to tell her something I saw. She was sleeping on the bed and I saw him laying next to her holding her hand saying, ""Jean, it's going to be alright, everything is going to be alright"" (the same as she was saying to him the night he died) after that, I just ran in our garage and remained in there for the rest of the day. He looked as though he was really laying right there. I don't know if it was real or if I was hallucinating (I had gotten in an argument prior to my sighting with my cousins so I was a little angry.)

Last Encounter,"California, United States",Family / Friends Visits,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Family / Friends Visits :: Last Encounter

M y Grandpa/Father-From-The-Heart/Best friend/Guardian Angel died of colon cancer on august 5th 1998. I had had 2 other experiences with him which were only known to me. This time he came to all of us (my grandma, my cousin, me, and anyone else who was in our house) before he died, he gave to my little cousin a toy horse for Christmas. This horse only ""nehey'd"", kicked its left front leg, and made a galloping noise (he was a big gambler and loved the horse races).

A few months after he died, the horse would go off by itself, we at first thought (because it was untouched on the shelf) that it was maybe movement automated (because anytime anyone walked by it would go off with out being touched). After about a week of this it got more frequent and got so annoying it was going off at all hours keeping us up all night. My grandmother decided to take out the batteries. It still went off (and by went off I mean it made galloping noises and neheying) it was even worst this time it was a 24/7 thing and I mean literally it never stopped, so my grandma put it under the bathroom sink and we were ordered to keep the door closed. It was hell when we went in there (and this wasn't an unsafe feeling, it was just annoying!)

After a few days it stopped making noises, it went on like that for only a day, we woke up one night to the sounds of crying (child's cry), we all woke up, my nana, my cousin, me, my step mom, my aunt, all of us searched the whole house for the sound, it did not sound like it was coming from the bathroom, but my nana did check the bathroom for the 3rd time and sure enough it was the horse she wrapped it in a towel and put it back under the sink. But that didn't lower the noise, that noise was so terrifying and it echoed throughout the house. It went on for maybe 3 days before my nana threw it outside in the garbage, the noise finally stopped.

Well one day (semi-peaceful thank god!) my cousin was running her mouth talking trash because she was in a bad mood (we all were), she started talking trash about Jewish people (Roger, my grandpa, was Jewish), well out of no where the horse falls off the dresser (no one brought it in the house) and it just disappeared and that's the last we ever saw of it, but not the last we wpould ever think of it, because my cousin (Frani) has a souvenir, a tiny little round circle embedded on her ankle, which she claims is from the horse. When it fell off the dresser, it bit her, as crazy as it sounded, she was jumping like crazy that day, saying something bit her! I looked at her ankle and there was a hot pink circle on it, no blood, no trace of evidence of it being from the horse, but we like to believe it was.

Are You Hungry?,"California, United States",Family / Friends Visits,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Family / Friends Visits :: Are You Hungry?

I t was in august of 1998, I had gotten in a fight with my 2 cousins, I don't even remember what it was about. They had isolated themselves from me (we had a couch that seat 3 and a couch that seat 2, they faced each other), I was on the big couch (which we called my couch) and my cousins were on the little couch (which we called it Frani's couch, my cousins couch). I looked at them and this women was sitting on the couch with them, literally, almost on top of them, she was chunky with curly blonde hair glasses and a pot with a ladle, she was saying ""are you children hungry? I could make you some food! What would you like?"" immediately I ran to the room to tell my grandma, but she was sleeping (that was the day I also saw my grandpa which is another story I submitted).

Later on I described the lady to my aunt. I described her to Vicki and she said that's exactly like my grandma Margaret (which was no relations to me), she said that Margaret was a big women who was always in the kitchen and made the best food.

Murder for Breakfast,"North Carolina, United States",Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: Murder for Breakfast

M y families have had bad ghost experiences over the years. My mother and aunt lifted their friend off the ground with the ""Light as a feather, Stiff as a board"" technique, my great aunt wore a nightgown of a family member and was haunted for it, and others. But the one I am going to tell you is so scary, it's famous. Are you ready for the ultimate scare?

My grandma and her family (sister, mom, dad) moved into a house that was said to be haunted. Well, my grandma's dad didn't believe in ghosts, and bought the house anyways. The first few nights were totally normal. But it was about a week before people started to make themselves known.

While playing in the living room one evening, my grandmother and sister were patiently waiting for dinner, not paying any attention. When I believe the front door opened, and they heard heavy, loud footsteps. No one was there. Through the living room, in and out of the kitchen, and out the door again.

Everyone freaked, but moved on. The next happening was another night. They heard heavy feet coming up the cellar stairs, thinking it was my great grandfather. The door opened, and no one was there! So they began to worry, but the only person not skeptical was my great grandpa. So one night, they heard a man moaning and walking the halls. This went on for 2 nights, when finally my great grandpa exclaimed, ""If you're comin' with me, you better get your clothes on!"" and they all left. No one ever stayed in the house again, but you can still see the basement where the man was buried.

Here's the story of the house: A man, woman and their daughter all lived in a house. The man would get drunk and come home and abuse his wife. The daughter got tired of it one day. So while the man was eating breakfast, the daughter hacked him in the back of his head with an axe. He fell out of his chair, though still alive! He tried to grab her, but she hacked him dead. She put him in the closet, then the basement. Years later she confessed but was not jailed.

Now, obviously the house is haunted. But one time my grandma took me to see it. We went down, and where his workbench was, a little padlock moved! I ran up the hill and jumped in the car as fast as I could, and we left. But come this Halloween, I vow to visit it once again.

A Sinister Shadow Entity,"Virginia, United States",Non Human Entities,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Non Human Entities :: A Sinister Shadow Entity

T his happened to me about a month or so ago, and I have posted it in a couple of places; one place for entertainment of others, and one place to try to find some answers to this encounter.

I have been having ghost experiences since I was very young; I am now 39 and quite seasoned at ghostly contact. I have seen and heard them, and also felt them touch me. I have had one encounter with an animal ghost, and a couple of encounters with shadow ghosts. This last experience, though, seems to have combined the two, and has left me a bit frightened.

I had JUST laid down in bed, and was facing my bedroom windows; lying on my right side. I am in the third town home from the corner; there is a streetlight on the corner, which affords a bit of light into the bedroom. I also have a 2-ft black light in the bedroom, which burns constantly. I was lying there, and noticed what I thought was my Papillon, with this forepaws up on the mattress, appearing to look at me intently. I stared at ""him"" for awhile, and I noticed that his figure wasn't moving... This is uncharacteristic of a 2-year old Pap, so I began examining the shadow a bit more in depth. I noted that the shadow was really, really dark... Darker than a normal shadow of an animal should have been. The ""thing"" also did not have my boy's butterfly ears; it appeared to be more the size and shape of a large house cat. I wanted to reach out to touch it, to see if it was real, but something told me I dare not do that.

I suddenly became very afraid (this thing was about 6 inches from my face, since I tend to sleep toward the very edge of the mattress) I squeezed my eyes shut for about a minute, and then reopened them to see the thing still there. I kept staring at it, angry and scared, and it began doing this weird motion with its head. Picture a cat moving its head in an ""infinity"" symbol shape; like a sideways '8'. I became VERY scared at this point, it was almost as if it wanted to hypnotize me. I closed my eyes again for a minute, and when I looked again the thing was gone.

Whatever this was, I feel it was very ancient, but lower-level, spiritually. As strange as this is going to sound, I feel that it was trying to get me out of my physical body to go on a journey that I did NOT want to take. I don't know if this was a shadow ghost (I usually see them as very dark, fast-moving shadows on the floor around my feet) or if this was some kind of psychic attack. I do know that this thing felt very malevolent and sinister... I did not like the way its essence or energy felt to me.

This has disturbed me since it happened. I was only able to bring myself to write about it a few nights ago! I came here searching for answers, perhaps someone knows what this could have been?

This has bothered me more than any old human spirit ever could... This thing was NOT HUMAN, and never was.

Ideas, comments, suggestions? Thanks in advance for reading this!

Trucker Apparition,"Arkansas, United States",Apparitions / Voices / Touches,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Apparitions / Voices / Touches :: Trucker Apparition

I must share this story with you before I write my second experience. For those of you that have read my last post , I mention that my adopted mom has experienced some horrific hauntings, ghost & spirits. This is one that happened about 1 year ago...

My adopted mom called me in a frantic one afternoon, and what she told me brought chill's to my whole body. She was traveling on a road in Arkansas when a herd of deer ran out in the middle of the road at 9:36pm. The traffic went to 70mph to BRAKES! There where 2, 18 wheelers in front of her and 3 cars in front of them. So you can only imagine the outcome. The 18 wheelers had to stop so quickly that the trailers swung around and cleared everything within its path, including the cab of the truck. There was wreckage and deer all over the road and luckily my mom was able to stop just in time; due to the smart distance that she kept, far enough away that she was able to stop (She has driven a truck for 20 years.) As she pulled of the median she noticed a man standing 6 ft from her trailer, wondering how a man got next to her trailer so fast and without her seeing him. She said he had one hand across his chest and one hand in his pocket; looking very confused.

The rescue team was on the way while the police where questioning the accident. One walked up to my mom and asked ""What happened here?"" As she was telling him about what happened she mentioned that ""Someone needs to check this guy out back, by my trailer he looks very confused, he might wonder off in the traffic"", and by then he had vanished. The cop said ""what man?"" Well he was just right there in plan view. The officer got a description so detailed down to facial hair and shoes! He walked away for a minute and came back and said the man you described is the owner of that wrecked 18 wheeler, and was found dead at the scene. She was in shock as the cop just turned around and walked the other way.

After she left, she stopped at a truck stop and on the news was the wreck she just witnessed. There were 4 fatalities that night. She even left the scene before the rescue team came. The man she seen next to her truck was one of the victims in the accident.

The Closet,"Wisconsin, United States",Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: The Closet

F or nine months, my husband and I occupied one of the upstairs bedrooms of his parents crowded three-bedroom home. After the wedding, it's a Hmong tradition to have the bride reside with the groom's side of the family. Primary reason is to have the wife get accustomed to how the family functions and to assist with the household chores.

It was a cold December weekend when the husband and I were to move to our tiny, one-bedroom apartment on the north side of town. His parents were out of town attending a wedding with the majority of his siblings. The only people left at home were the both of us, his 4-year old sister Heidi, and his younger brother who stayed behind to help with the move.

Now to give you a background of his parents' house, which they still reside in today, was built back in the 1920's. While renovating the living room, we found old newspapers dating back to 1924 - they were used as instillation in the walls. The house has an eerie appearance and dark areas where no matter how much sunlight came into the home, that area would still be dark as shadows. Moving on to the basement - I remember my husband telling me that when they moved in 18 some years ago, the basement had dirt ground that they had to replace with concrete. Today, the basement is still unfinished and with minimal lighting, it's a frightening place to be if one was alone.

So with the four of us at home, Heidi and I were upstairs packing the small, fragile items while the husband and his brother were downstairs, loading our things into the moving truck. The only thing left in our room was the clothes in the closet, the TV, some DVD's, and my treasures (junk according to the husband). While I packed the treasures into a box, Heidi was watching Disney's ""Beauty and the Beast"" in the room. I never like to be upstairs in that house by myself. I noticed Heidi kept looking at the closet, I thought perhaps she wanted to play dress up so I pulled out some of my old party dresses and laid them on the floor for her to pick out. But she didn't bother to look at them because she was still focused on the closet. I was a bit concerned, so I sat in the middle between her and the closet. I veered her attention back to the TV screen. Every three minutes or so, Heidi leaned over me and stared at the closet. ""What is it?"" I asked. ""Nothing"" she replied. We continued watching the movie. I was so glued to the set that the next thing I knew, she was standing in front of the closet with the door open.

""What are you looking at?"" I asked her. I was looking at the giant stuffed bear the husband had given me for Valentine's, ""Is this what you want?"" ""No, Nyab, what is that?"" Heidi asked without pointing to anything in particular. (Nyab translates to sister-in-law in the Hmong language). I looked around the closet, didn't notice anything unusual. ""What is what?"" I asked, now very confused. So I opened the closet door further and went through the objects in it - nothing was out of the ordinary just clothes, shoes, and stuffed animals I was going to donate to Goodwill.

All of a sudden, Heidi screamed and pointed to something in the closet, ""That Nyab, what's that?"" I looked, again... nothing out of the ordinary, ""I don't see what you're looking at."" Then suddenly Heidi was jumping up and down, still focused on whatever it was in the closet, and her eyes were wide. ""It's a boy, he's as tall as I, who is he Nyab? What is the boy doing in your closet?"" she questioned. ""What boy?"" I asked, still searching through the heap of toys. A few seconds later, it hit me that this was an entity that allowed Heidi to see him but not me. I screamed and ran downstairs with Heidi trailing behind me.

Although I didn't see or heard anything, I was still afraid. When we got downstairs and joined the guys, Heidi was giggling. I told the husband what happened. He asked Heidi what she saw and she replied, ""I saw a boy sitting in Nyab's closet. He was as tall as I am and he kept looking at me. I tried to talk to him but he can't talk back. It's so funny because Nyab was so scared."" She continued giggling. I was relieved that she found the situation amusing. I can still picture her face when she saw the boy - she went pale and her eyes were wider than ever and I was so afraid it was going to traumatize her.

It's been two years since the incident. The younger brother and his new bride are living in that very room today. Recently, the wife said she had a bad dream and she woke up to find a dark figure standing by the closet. I guess the boy is still there.

Red-Handed,"Texas, United States",Old Hags / Night Attacks / Sleep Paralysis,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Old Hags / Night Attacks / Sleep Paralysis :: Red-Handed

I just ran into this site two days ago looking for real-life ghost stories. I read a few stories, Tiki Face Phantom , The Piano Plays On , and a few others. I didn't want to leave my story at first, but I feel that it's my responsibility to share. It was about 4 years ago, and I will never forget.

I used to stay with my mother in a two bedroom, two bath apartment in a popular neighborhood in Houston, Texas (Acres Homes). My twin cousins, me, and my oldest niece were all in my room having one of those late night girl chats. I remember myself falling asleep early, as I always did. I fell asleep with them talking in the background. I remember the dream/nightmare I had so vividly.

In this dream, I was being chased by a man that I did not know, but he was convinced that I was familiar with him. Trying to escape his taunts, my fast walk became a steady sprint. While in a full out run, the guy was trailing behind until, I thought, I had lost him. I stopped at a street corner, huddled over trying to catch my breath. After a few gaping gasp I looked over my shoulder and a strong force pushed me into on-coming traffic.

I woke up in a sweat with an intense feeling of pressure and heat on my back. I told my cousins and niece about the dream frantically, ran to bathroom mirror and lifted up my shirt. There, on my shoulder blades, were two full grown hand prints. A few minutes later the prints turned from red to blue as if it was bruising, but I still felt the heat.

When reminiscing about that night, my cousins and niece joke around saying that I yelled ""Someone pushed me!"" as soon as I woke up. I can laugh at it now, but then, I was terrified.

More on my Apartment,"Pennsylvania, United States",Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: More on my Apartment

S ome of you may have read some of the articles I posted in the past regarding my apartment . Well last night I had something happen that was really creepy. I was in bed sleeping and my wife was in the living room watching something mind numbing on E! or MTV. I had just fallen asleep and I heard a female crying. I woke up and figured it was whatever my wife was watching but it was very clear and there is no way it came through a wall.

About 30 seconds later, I was wide awake at this point, I heard it again and it was right next to me by the closet door. I was freaked out.

I will say that it was a long day of getting allergy tests and I watched a few episodes of Ghost Hunters shortly before bed but this sound was so CLEAR. It was as if every other sound from the AC and the TV in the other room had been blocked out so I could hear this sound and only this sound.

I am wondering, if in fact we do have some kind of spirit in our apartment, if we are going to see more activity because we are moving. Our apartment is infested with mold and I am highly allergic. We are moving on 11-17-07 and I have packed mostly everything that we will not need on a daily basis. Perhaps it knows we will be leaving and is sad or just wants to make sure we get out?

The Classroom Entity in a Black Cloak,Canada,Non Human Entities,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Non Human Entities :: The Classroom Entity in a Black Cloak

I don't know how this happened without my classmates knowing, but I will tell what happened. It started in grade 7 when I first started seeing things like that. I was in my class during our lunch hour around March 14-16. I was in my class eating when it started to rain outside, so we stayed inside our class for lunch recess as well and me and my friend Nicholas (Nick) were sitting face to face on our desks. Then all of a sudden I felt like time stopped because through my eyes no one moved or talked, and the clock didn't move either. Then I looked straight ahead and behind Nicholas, I saw a giant thing in a black cloak. I was shocked and it was like the back of my class broke off and disappeared and it was like he was in front of the top of a tornado. He came closer to Nick and he raised his fist.

Then I blinked and I jumped at Nicholas and pushed him off his desk and he fell onto the floor (still not moving) then I felt a cold fist on my back and my head. Then I blinked and it was gone. It was so creepy and scary and since then, I can see and hear strange things, my friends think it is a guardian angel, I think different. Thanks for listening and believe what you want but only I know the truth.

The Raggedy Ann Doll  in the Creek,"Illinois, United States",Misc,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Misc :: The Raggedy Ann Doll  in the Creek

T his happened when I was about seven or eight. My older brother, sister and, I would go down to this creek near our backyard to play. We would sit and catch tadpoles. Now, one day we went down there and there was this doll in the creek. I think there called Raggedy Ann Dolls, though I'm not sure. It was face down in the muck. It looked old and worn like it had been made in the late 1800's. Its clothing was torn and the back of the head looked like it had been burned. We really didn't pay any attention to it. We kept going about our usually routine of looking at frogs and catching tadpoles.

We then headed back to the area of the creek where the doll had been. I noticed, as did my brother and sister, that the doll had been moved. At first we thought that someone was tricking us. So, we passed by not thinking anything of it. Now I know this part is going to sound like I made it up but I swear it's the truth! The doll had turned and faced us as we walked passed. When we saw this happen we ran out of the creek. We tried to tell our parents what had happened but of course they didn't believe us. We decided then to never go back to the creek.

Military Spirit Never Dies!,"North Carolina, United States",Poltergeists / Physical Manifestations,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Poltergeists / Physical Manifestations :: Military Spirit Never Dies!

I am actually writing this on behalf of my husband, he is still a little weirded out by his experience. I believe he has been a skeptic for a little while, where as I have had my own experience and was excited to hear he believes this is above and beyond normal.

Here is a little background. He is in the United States Military and is stationed on a base that was once used as an african american basic training camp back in 1945. It is still in use today as a schooling facility, all of the original buildings still stand, most are condemned. The building where this took place was used as the Brig in 1945 or as we know it the jail, it is now used as a communications building.

This story actually happened tonight. I just got off the phone with my husband who is on duty and he was taking a dinner break. His friend had left leftovers in their office fridge, which is in the communications building I mentioned. He has keys to his building, which was locked, indicating that no one was working this late at night. My husband walked into the main hallway and was searching for his key to open his office when he heard each door down the hallway open and close with 5 second intervals between them. Each door is also locked each and every night when office hours are over. The last door that that opened and closed on its own was right in front of my husband who physically watched the door do this. Mind you, all the doors were locked, he heard the knob pop the lock, open, and close again.

As this wave came towards him, he glanced through the glass of his office door and watched all of the computers turn on to their start up screen. All of the computers are shut down nightly. As the last door opened and closed my husband instantaneously felt as if he was burning up as if he was sitting in front of a furnace.

Well needless to say my husband high tailed it out of there and does not want to go back. Unfortunately, he works there so I hope he takes notice if the computers are still on tomorrow!

The Man in the Class Window,Philippines,Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: The Man in the Class Window

I study in a very old school in Zamboanga. Ateneo de Zamboanga University is a very old school, it was founded during American era and I'm not surprised that so many spirits dwell the campus. I remember when I spent my first overnight in our school. My classmates and I were very excited for the said event because it will be one of the last times we'll be all together since we were graduating that same year.

Our moderator told us to occupy two rooms on the fourth floor of the HS building because another section was occupying the HS AVR. My friends and I prepared for this overnight and we brought a huge radio component so that no one will get bored that night. It was about 9-10 pm that night when a friend of mine turned up the volume of the radio, that's the time that most of us were dancing in front of an empty classroom and on the hallway of the fourth floor. My best friend, Fabie (not his real name) and my classmates were dancing in front of the Campion Room when suddenly Dags (not his real name also) noticed an obscure reflection on the glass of the door. It was an image of a man wearing a uniform with no seal and had a black complexion and it almost looked like that it had no head due to the dark surroundings. He thought that it was just the reflection of our other classmates who's with him that night on the hallway. He pushed Vohaary to see if its Voh's reflection then the image of the boy didn't move, after that he pushed Alwasir to see if its Al's reflection but the image didn't move either. He started looking around and noticed that everyone was dancing and he realized that no one was wearing a uniform that night.

The hair on the back of his neck stood up then pulled Dags to his spot and pointed to the glass of the door then ran inside our sleeping quarters. Dags, who was a clairvoyant, also noticed the reflection of the man but thought that it was only his reflection, as he danced to the sound of the beat he was shocked that the reflection didn't moved, then he realized that things weren't normal anymore, so he also rushed inside to another classroom.

""Pare, nakita mo yun? Yung bata naka uniform?""(have you seen that? The boy wearing a uniform?) Asked Fabie.

""Nakita mo rin pare? Grabe! Akala ko ako yun nakikita ko pero hindi pala!""(You've also seen that? All I thought was who I'm looking at but it really wasn't me!) Dags exclaimed. Matt and I overheard their commotions and asked what happened.

""Nakakita kami ng multo, parang estudyante na naka uniform pero walang ulo"" (We saw a ghost, he looks like a headless student wearing a uniform.) Fabie whispered, so our other classmates won't be scared.

""Huwe? Barbero! Walang ulo? Guni guni mo lang yan pare!"" (oh come on! Headless? It's just you're imagination!) I said to Fabie.

""Totoo, tanungin mo pa si Dags, nakita rin niya."" (It's true, ask Dags, he also saw it.) Fabie explained.

""Oo Gagi! Parang walang ulo dahil ang itim talaga niya."" (Yeah! He looks like headless because he's so very dark.) Dags said with a hysterical face or maybe it's just he's reaction when he sees a ghost.

Matt and I were so curious that we tried to see the so-called apparition on the glass but we saw nothing. After that we tried to ignore the scary event and enjoyed the night away.

Days have passed then weeks; nothing unusual happened after that scary experience, but we never dared to stay late in our classroom because of the man in the glass window.

A month has passed since that faithful encounter, but what comes after would shock me completely. It was Family Day, a special event in our school, so there were numerous students in the school that night. It was almost 7 p.m and almost all the buildings in our campus were deserted because it was Sunday and all the people are on the backfield. Since the program was dull and boring the class decided to do some ""extra-curricular"" activities.

So as adventurous teens, we tried to amuse ourselves and decided to go on another ghost hunting expedition. We split in small groups, some went to the college building, some went to the LRC building and the others went to the HS room. The ones who went to the HS building climbed up until the fourth floor of the building without knowing what had happen to Fabie in the past. As they walked past the hallway, one girl saw someone was standing inside the Campion Room, the same classroom were Fabie and Dags saw the apparition. It was a man with dark complexion that almost looked decapitated since it had no head. She asked herself someone in that room late at night and wearing a uniform since it was Sunday. Realizing what they saw wasn't normal, they rushed down the building as fast as they could.

After the scary experiences our classmates have endured, never again did we dare to get inside the building during nighttime.

To this day, no one has any idea of the identity of that man in the mirror and what he wants to say. Some assumed that it was one of the students who committed suicide during the 90's, others say that it was one of the restless souls that got disturbed, since our school was build on top of a old abandoned cemetery.

I guess, we'll never know, but that experience was the thing we needed to remember our high school memories bye.

An Old Man Opens my Eyes to Life After Death,United Kingdom,Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: An Old Man Opens my Eyes to Life After Death

I 've always had things happen to me or around me that I can never explain, but when I moved into a four bedroom house, life took a turn in a direction I dare not imagine. I had two sons and was pregnant with my daughter. My eldest son used to (so we thought) talk to himself, I put it down to him having an imaginary friend, I later found out I was wrong. Small things like doors shutting with no breeze, the remote moving on its own and other little things you try and put to the back of your mind kept happening, we learnt to live with it.

Well, I moved again quite quickly because my landlord lost the house, we were going through quite a bad spell and managed to find somewhere. One night my son came up to me and said ""alfred is waving mom please wave at him"". I looked out the window but couldn't see anyone, this happened for a few weeks, him talking about alfred, and to him, I was starting to become worried.

That night I went to bed I couldn't sleep, I tried everything I just could sleep. The room went weirdly cold, I tried cuddling my partner but I couldn't move an inch, I felt hand pressure pinning me down, I tried shouting but nothing came out, I was petrified this lasted about five minutes but god it seemed like a life time.

The same thing happened again another two times, each time me waking to find bruises where it looked like I'd been grabbed and held. No one could really explain it, everyone kept saying I was imagining it or dreaming it, I wasn't. I had someone come into my home as I couldn't bare to be in there alone anymore, even with people there I was so scared. They told me there was an old man sitting in my chair with a beard going by the name of alfred, and that he had come from the house I was in previously. Apparently he was here not to harm me, but to protect me, to watch over my family through our time of need, and it was my son who he could communicate with, but because I was trying to ignore the situation, this is why he did what he did to me, to make me open my eyes to another life, life after death.

It didn't really stop there though because every now and again, I'd get a reminder like a voice through my partner, and tap across the face, the room going pitch black when the sun is shining through it. I started to accept the fact that this is going to stay with me whether I liked it or not, and still to this day I get happenings going on, no matter where I live its something or other, my partner still to this day won't accept that these things happen to all walks of life, but still he hasn't come up with a better explanation.

My son has grown out of talking to people he can't see. Alfred left us alone once our life was back on track, and now next week I'm getting my house blessed as I have just moved in, a fresh start all round I think.

Saying that I'm not sure I will ever get a peaceful life... I wanted to share this part of my life with you in case your going through the same thing, try to stay calm and accept always what's going on, that I have learned not to be ignorant to. In a way it's comforting to know there's life after death...

The Ireland Haunted House,Ireland,Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: The Ireland Haunted House

T he school bus picked me every morning at the side road that led up to my aunt's house, and every afternoon it dropped me there again. And so twice a day, on the bus, I passed the entrance to the mysterious road. It wasn't much of a road any more. It was choked with weeds and blackberry bushes, and the woods on both sides pressed in so closely that the branches met overhead, and it was dark and gloomy even on bright days. The bus driver once pointed out to me:

""Folks that go in there after dark,"" he said, ""well, they usually don't ever come out again. There's a haunted house about a quarter of a mile down that road..."" He paused. ""But you ought to know about that, Alex. It was your grandfather's house...""

I knew about it, and I knew that it now belonged to my Aunt Mary. But my aunt would never talk to me about the house. She said the stories about it were silly nonsense and there were no such things as ghosts. If all the villagers weren't a lot of superstitious idiots, she would be able to buy me some decent clothes.

I thought it was all very well to say that there were no such things as ghosts, but how about the people who had tried to live there? Aunt Mary had rented the house three times, but every family had moved out within a week. They said the things that went on there were just too queer. So nobody would live in it any more.

I thought about the house a lot. If I could only prove that there wasn't a ghost... And one Saturday when my aunt was in the village, I took the key to the haunted house from its hook on the kitchen door, and started out.

I went in the house. It turned out to be the bravest thing I've ever did. I went in, and before I could stop it the door closed with a bang by itself. And it was then, as I was pulling frantically at the handle to get out, that I saw the ghost! It behaved just as you would expect a ghost to behave. It was a tall, dim white figure, and it came gliding slowly down the stairs towards me. I gave a yell, yanked the door open, and tore down the steps. I never went back in their again!

My aunt and the villagers put fire to the house and it burned down. Never to be tempered with.

My Life with Spirits,"Illinois, United States",Psychic / Medium,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Psychic / Medium :: My Life with Spirits

I had always felt that something was always around me. I could not see it but I knew it was there. I have always been afraid. Sometimes I would enter someone home and feel the presence or sometimes the hairs on the back of my neck would stand completely up. I never wanted to see or feel anything, but I always did. I am going to tell you of a few occurrences that has happened to me.

When I was a young girl, I was very rebellious with my upbringing. My mother would ground me and after the punishment, I would start all over again. One night after my mother's rantings, I was in my bedroom, very upset with her. (Me upset! It was my fault I was grounded.) I heard my name being called. I just sat there not moving, I wanted my mother to suffer for grounding me. Just then I heard my name being called again. A little louder this time. I sat there still not moving. The third time, my name was called I knew my mother was angry. I suddenly thought I better get to moving and find out what she wanted. When I walked into her bedroom (slowly), and I called her name, she did not answer. I called my mother's name again, and I then realized she was asleep (dhe snored quite loud). When I had awaken her from her sleep, she then asked what did I want. I told her she called my name and I came to see what she wanted. She sat up and told me she did not call my name. I was so scared, I ran to my room, jumped into my bed with the covers over my head and forced myself to sleep.

Another time I was lying on my mother's couch and my back was facing her kitchen and my face was facing the couch. I looked downwards with my eyes and saw someone come from the back of my mother's bedroom. Thinking it was her, I faked like I was asleep, being that she was upset with me and I her. I felt the presence walk over to where I was lying and peaked down over me, watching to see if I was asleep. I laid that way until the presence left me and went back the way it came.

The next morning, I asked my mother if she came into the living room to see if I was resting or not. She looked and told me, she did not leave her bedroom. I was frightened again.

When things like that happened to me I would call my grandmother and she would interpret to me those things I did not understand. She would tell me it was my aunt looking over me.

Another occurrence was when my daughter was sick in the hospital, I was so upset I could not sleep, eat or drink anything. I knew she was going to pass over and I could not accept her passing. I was alone and I needed to speak with someone. While sitting alone, someone entered my room and sat down. I briefly looked over and saw this young man dressed in white and he smiled at me and asked me what was wrong. I looked into his face (I can not remember how he looked) and I felt so at peace and started telling him all about my daughter who was sick in the ICU unit and everything that was bottled inside of me. I can not tell you to this day how I fell asleep but I did.

The next morning the hospital staff woke me and told me my daughter was not doing so well and for me to go and see her for the last time. I then began to ask about the person who had came into the waiting room and put my mind at ease. The hospital staff looked at me and told me there was no such person on duty last night. When I asked again and described this young man to the hospital staff I was told the same thing; that no one was on duty that night who fits that description.

After my daughter's passing, I would hear in my living room walking around in her walker. I would pray that she would not come into my bedroom. She would come down the hallway towards my bedroom and that is where she would stop. Then the walking would start all over again, but never did she come into my room. I knew then that she was at peace. That helped me to cope with the loss I felt with her being gone.

I have had a lot more experiences which is too long to write. May be in the near future, I will share some more of my experiences.

In the interim, I would like to know if anyone has had experiences similar to mine.

All in the Family,"South Carolina, United States",Apparitions / Voices / Touches,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Apparitions / Voices / Touches :: All in the Family

I t seems that I have a paranormal experience almost everyday! Just a couple of days ago something happened. I was in my apartment, on my knees, praying before I went to bed. It was about 2:00 am. There was nobody here but my husband and myself. The television, radio and computer were all shut off for the night. All was quiet, until I heard laughter. It wasn't just any kind of laughter! It was the sound of two children laughing, right in my ear! I quickly finished my prayer and opened my eyes. Of course, there was nothing there. So I told my husband, and he thought it was odd that he didn't hear it. So I kind of blew it off and went to bed.

This morning, my mom sent me a text message on my phone at about 6:00 am. She asked me if I would please call her. I thought it was kind of odd, but I did as I was asked. So when I get her on the phone, she is all excited. I ask her what's going on and what she said totally shocked me.

She told me that just a little bit earlier, my dad had told her that something woke him up at about 2:00 that morning. He was just laying in bed and he heard singing. It wasn't just anyone singing, it was two children singing! He said that he just listened to it until he finally fell back asleep.

About an hour after he told my mom that, my 10 year old brother woke up and said ""Amy has kids"". My mom was shocked! So she asked him what he was talking about. He told her that he had a dream that he was playing with my kids! Which is totally weird, since I've only been married a year and DON'T have any kids!

The Ghost of 318,"Pennsylvania, United States",Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: The Ghost of 318

W e had just moved into our new house and when we got there, it was like 11 o'clock at night so it was really dark and it wasn't fun. We moved the couch and some other stuff into our new house and that's when it began. I laid on the couch with my dog in between my legs, watched out the window and it was fun until the rest of my family fell asleep, except me, and I heard something loud upstairs.

My dog poppie darted up the steps and then I heard her yipe and she came back down with her tail in between her legs. Then I went upstairs and looked, all of a sudden it got really cold so I got my sweatshirt on and continued to look around. It was in my room whatever it was, it made lots of noise. So as I sat in my room, my closet doors swung open. I looked around and saw nothing. I walked back down and sat, there I heard something or someone walk across my bedroom floor before I knew it, it was morning, it stopped.

To this day my tv still turns on and off and my bedroom door, even when it's locked, swings open, also my closet doors slide and they open but I know whatever it is, it won't hurt me. My dog wakes up and barks at mid air and I'll wake up and my TV will be on discovery channel with the show ""A haunting"" and my windows will be open and it will be cold. But I can live with it.

Strange Awakenings,"North Carolina, United States",Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: Strange Awakenings

L ately I have been waking up really early in the morning for no reason. And it's really dark, like 1 a.m. and when I go to see what time it is, it's like someone is following me and watching me. And every time I turn around, nothing is there.

Last night actually, after doing my rounds after I woke up, I was really freaked out. I am not afraid of the dark. Just what lies in it. So I was thinking I was definitely not going to be able to go back to sleep without some noise, otherwise the boogeyman would eat me! So I turned my fan back on, and cranked up my radio. As I was closing my eyes, I heard something that sounded a lot like my dad walking in to wake me up or something. So I roll over and turn around, and no one is there! This scares me. So I pray and say in my head, ""In the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost, I demand you not even to state your business and leave the premises for ever!"" And after this, a sense of calmness fell upon the threshold. And so, I slowly but surely drifted off to sleep.

The next morning, I woke up not even aware of what happened the night before, not to remember all day until now, at 5:37 p.m this day. (The same day as the story.) Does anyone have any suggestions as to why this is happening to me? I think it is more paranoia than anything, but who am I to say? Please leave comments and try to explain why I am so disturbed. I will keep up with the comments and post back, so if you have a question, leave it in a comment and I will answer it.

Thanks everyone and I hope I can, with your help, figure this thing out!

The Painting,"Nebraska, United States",Misc,"T his event occurred prior to my birth in 1976. It is not a first hand account, so I will just tell you what my mother told me. In the early 1970's, my parents bought a small house in Nebraska. It was their second or third house, I am not sure. When they moved in, there was a painting from the early 1900's hanging on the wall of the house. It was the only thing in the house, no furniture, no appliances, nothing. My mother told me that the portrait bared a striking resemblance to my father, but as if he were an old man. At the time, my father was in his early 30's. The painting made my mother understandably uneased.

My parents took the painting down and stored it in the basement. They lived in that house for a few years before deciding to move outside of town to an acreage. This was before I was born, and my oldest brothers were pre-teens. During the moving process, they discovered the painting that had been there when they first moved in. Neither of them really wanted the painting because it unnerved them both.

They decided to put the portrait back on the wall where they originally found it. They completed packing for the move and never gave it a second thought.

Once they arrived at their new acreage, they started to unpack and move into their new house (subsequently involved in one of my other stories ). When they entered the house during the move, the portrait of the old engineer was hanging on the wall of their bedroom. They were quite vexed at this occurrence. They ended up taking the painting and storing it in the attic. It has been there ever since. I have never laid eyes on it and I dread the day that I do.

Spying on Them,United Arab Emirates,Apparitions / Voices / Touches,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Apparitions / Voices / Touches :: Spying on Them

A ll you people must have realized that we are not alone when we think we are. In fact there exist tens of unseen creatures in all of our houses (even right now, around you). It's not that these creatures (""ghosts"") are only found in haunted places or in places where you spot them, but they are also around places where you don't sense them or see them. The reason you're thinking they are not there is that the ""ghosts"" of that place are simply not interested in bothering you.

So my story is about my ""unseens"" in my bedroom. This happened a couple of months ago. I am not scared of darkness or ""ghosts"" or even demons or anything. Every time I experience something it is more challenging than the previous one.

So that night I was ready to sleep. There was no night lamp in my room but there was a very dim light that enveloped the room, you can at least figure out the walls and furniture and if someone stood in the room he would appear like a dark shadow.

I was half way to falling asleep but then I was disturbed by some murmuring sound, some people talking to each other. I did not sit up or make a big move when I woke up. I simply opened my eyes slowly. There was nobody in the room but as I saw in the mirror of my dresser (the mirror is big enough to see your whole body if you stand in front of it), I saw two boys, one around 6-7 years and the other around 11-12 years of age. I did not get freaked out but I just tried to make sure that what I am seeing is true and that I am not dreaming. So I looked where they were standing, they were not there, but when I saw in the mirror I could see them.

I did this for about 4 to 5 times to be sure that these people were only seen in the mirror and at the same time I tried to listen to their conversation. They were talking a strange language. I tried to understand them but I couldn't. They were just simply standing there and talking to each other as someone would in their own house. It looked like the ""elder brother"" was making the younger one understand something.

After a while of me ""spying on them"" maybe they came to know that I was not sleeping anymore and they stopped talking and turned their heads towards me slowly and slowly faded out. I went back to sleep with no surprising expression on my face as this was not the first or one of the ""few"" incidents, things happen all the time.

My House Is Filled with Strange Activities,Canada,Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: My House Is Filled with Strange Activities

T his all started when I began to stay alone in my house (I was about 12). I would be alone in the house and I would be doing something when I would see things from the corner of my eye and I would hear things constantly. An example of seeing things would be things such as light or a shadow sort of passing me, but being gone when I would really look for it. My dog and cats would follow things with their eyes and the dog wags her tail while supposedly starring off into space.

I never really thought much of it until one day I was alone watching t.v. while sitting near a coffee table and a plastic spoon hit me (I had a bunch of them sitting on the coffee table at the time for one reason or another). That's when I knew something was here.

Once when I was younger, I was walking to my bedroom at night and saw what appeared to be a person or large dog (it was a black shape) curled up on my mother's bed. Recently, (I'm 16 now) I've been seeing things and hearing things more often and I'm not the only one. My boyfriend was walking into my room and when he got to my bed, he looked towards the door and saw a dark shadowy figure of a man standing there. I was there but I didn't bother to look because I have seen things like that when I was younger IN my room. It has not been inside my room since I have been shutting the door at night. My mother recently was in her bedroom and saw what she thought was the dog but when she turned to look it wasn't there and our dog was downstairs.

I hear cars and things driving by my house or pulling in the driveway almost everyday (me and my mother live close to the road where there isn't exactly a load of traffic) and we have these big windows facing the road so I would see if anything was there and half the time it's ""nothing"".

Personally I believe that the raised activity is because of the work that was just done to a part of the house (near the side door). We had the floor torn up and had a new one put in. Another theory I have as to why I see things all the time is because when I was around 12 and 13 me and some friends would play with a Ouija board at my friend's houses (he lived at his grandmothers and then with his mother and stepfather and currently with his father).

Recurring Nightmare,"South Carolina, United States",Old Hags / Night Attacks / Sleep Paralysis,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Old Hags / Night Attacks / Sleep Paralysis :: Recurring Nightmare

I know that you have already heard a thousand stories just like, mine but if I don't soon get some answers I may have to move. Here are my facts. I live with my boyfriend in his house that is beside and across from a cemetery. Please know that there is a new graveyard and a real old one, but I have never been afraid of grave yards or death or ghost... That is until I started having these nightmares.

Andy (boyfriend) and I sleep in separate rooms (he snores) and I only have these dreams in my room and no other room in the house. Only two families have lived in this house and we have known the previous owners for years and nothing bad ever happened in this house. So with those facts, here is my dream. I am sleeping and I feel something pushing on my bed frame or mattress, when I open my eyes there is something in the room with me. Now I have never felt or seen a ghost my whole life so I'm not sure if I am just petrified when I wake up of what.

Last night I dreamed this thing was in my room and I kept trying to roll over and it was holding me down, I have even woke up feeling like it was sitting on top of me. Last night it woke me up and as soon as I opened my eyes it was sitting on the floor RIGHT in front of me starring at me then it just disappeared. I have said out loud several times that it has me scared s***less and to please let me sleep.

I am at my wits end... This has been happening now for about 6 months. Please tell me I'm not crazy and what I should do to get some sleep...

Crybaby Bridge in Salem Ohio,"Ohio, United States",Photographs / Videos / EVP,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Photographs / Videos / EVP :: Crybaby Bridge in Salem Ohio

T his is the story of Crybaby Bridge. There is a story of a mother who lost her baby while the mother and father were fighting, the baby was found at the bottom of the driveway where a bridge was, as the mother was running to save her baby, the baby fell over the bridge, to this day you can hear the scream of the baby and it's mother coming to save it. Whether or not it's true I didn't know, but I do now. My wife and I went there on 10-05-07 and took about 150 pictures and got nothing but orbs and got to hear some pretty spooky sounds.

We went back the next day mid afternoon and took about 20 pictures and only came up with some beautiful scenery pictures... BUT... we went back that night... And WOW... what an Eerie night. I took about 142 pictures and came up with some orbs in about 4 of them but this one in particular was just creepy. It was about 9:00 pm and around 68 degrees. After getting creeped out after hearing a weird moaning sound (could have been a dog or wild animal and my mind was playing tricks on me) I got back into the car and told my wife to get me out of there. Just as we was about to back out I reached out the window and took one last picture and when I looked at it I saw this apparition and just knew there had to be some truth to the story behind Crybaby Bridge in Salem Ohio

Our House Has a Visitor,"Utah, United States",Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: Our House Has a Visitor

W e moved into our house six years ago in a small town called Hooper. It is a small farm town settled by Pioneers in 1849. Our house was built for us, the land is an old hay field with no known paranormal history. I have searched online and in the library for any abnormal history without any luck. Recently there have been some strange activities in the house. Here are the latest three:

1. My wife and I were in the bathroom taking a shower. The light switch is across the room and I was standing in front of the shower door rinsing my hair so my wife could not pass without bumping into me. The door was locked so no one could come in. The light switch is a dimmer switch. When I opened my eyes, the lights on the dimmer switch were much brighter. I asked my wife if she turned it on, she responded, ""No I saw it move by itself..."" Another time I was in the shower alone, the door was locked and I turned around just in time to see the dimmer switch move up by itself. The lights the dimmer were on turned on all the way, and they were brighter than I have ever seen them. After the shower I tested the switch and it appeared to work normal. It is not loose and takes some pressure to slide the switch on.

2. My wife was home with my oldest and they heard footsteps walking around on the back deck. They looked out the window and could not see anything. We live on an acre, so no one could come on the porch and run off without being seen. They investigated around the house and the lot (no trees) and saw no one.

3. We have wood floors in our house. One night I heard footsteps run across them. I shouted for the kids to go back to bed. The footsteps stopped then started again. I got up to see which kid was wondering around, but they were all fast asleep. I sat back down and heard steps run back and forth for 10 minutes. The steps repeated over and over like someone was lost, looking for something.

My Friendly Whispering Ghost and Her Dog,United Kingdom,Pets / Animals,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Pets / Animals :: My Friendly Whispering Ghost and Her Dog

M y story is not at all far fetched but I believe I love my friendly whispering ghost. I was thirteen, I was studying to be a veterinarian at an all girls school downtown. I preferred to spend time by myself, waiting for my animal to appear by my side. I had always had a feeling that someone was trying to communicate with me, this required me being ready in my own space.

She first stayed over a night, sleeping close by my side, and her dog ghost would sleep under the bed. We shared my teddies. Played as children do realizing that we had the adults to deal with at dinner-time. What fun we had. The ghost would chase me up the stairs and I would be almost out of breath. I would be told that my book was hers and not mine because she was in trouble more than I was. We decided together that I would leave with her on a suitable night. I fell asleep waiting for her to appear when she wanted, well she appeared. She was wearing a little wedding dress, a greying tattered old veil. She woke me up especially and held up my up to date clock. That clock never worked again. Never.

I saw her many years later, happily running through a grave yard with an arch way, no church. She was wearing the same little wedding dress and tattered greying veil. Her face was a child's face. No horrific scratches, just a purity of understanding that she was not from my years, she was from before me.

Not long after this meeting. I placed a lot of my work into the pet she brought into my life. I would nourish the elements of a normal life for the pet. Without going too overboard. The animal walked to me in the darkness and has followed me ever since even growling at the dangerous steps I had to take to leave the home that we had met in.

My Haunted Life,"Massachusetts, United States",A Haunted Life,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: A Haunted Life :: My Haunted Life

W e had this dog when I was a kid, her name was Rags and she was fairly ancient by the time I was eleven. So old in fact that I wasn't even surprised when she passed. For years afterwards as I cowered underneath the covers in my childhood bedroom I could hear the soft clicking of her nails on the linoleum kitchen floor. My parents always told me it was the result of an overactive imagination. Of course, that was the explanation they offered me when I was age sixteen and still slept every night with the covers over my head.

It wasn't just Rags that made me afraid in their house, it was everything else. Little noises and sounds. For as long as I could remember, I would wake up because someone would say my name right in my ear. So loud it would jolt me from sleep. Was I dreaming?

As I grew older it became easier to write these things off as silly childhood fears and for several years I made due with just that. When I turned 22 I moved into a new apartment with my boyfriend and soon began to experience that same feeling again. I couldn't explain it quite right. It just felt... Empty and wrong. After years of feeling secure the feeling had returned.

Often nights I would spend laying on my back in bed, watching a shadow move precariously back and forth in front of the bedroom door. Eventually I began waking up to the feeling of fingers poking and prodding into my legs and breath in my ear. One night I was sitting on my bed talking to my boyfriend and we both heard the word ""hello"" come from a male voice in the living room, there was nobody there upon investigation.

My cats began to act very strangely and out of character. One night I sat on the couch, home alone I heard the unmistakable sound of someone sitting down in my office chair, the slow squeak of it rocking back and forth. Both of my cats were on the couch with me so I knew that neither one of them could be the culprit.

I finally moved out of that apartment, I hated it, the way that it felt. I moved into a new apartment that feels a lot better but strange things still happen. Doors have begun closing on a day when no windows are open. Not even closing, but slamming shut as I walk by them. One night I woke up and I could swear I saw a little boy standing at the foot of my bed. One morning my boyfriend reported that the night before he'd woken up and he thought I was kneeling at the foot of our bed but when he turned to look at where the empty space should be, I was laying there sleeping.

One evening, watching television with my friend Olivia we had quite the scare. We were watching some show and for no obvious reason Olivia stood up from the couch and walked over to the door and stood there. She simply stood there and continued watching TV. Two seconds later a loud bang echoed from the wall right behind where she had just been sitting. To this day she can't remember why she stood up and walked across the room.

So I don't know. Am I haunted or is it just the results of an overactive imagination?

Spirit of a Movie Star,"Arizona, United States",Apparitions / Voices / Touches,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Apparitions / Voices / Touches :: Spirit of a Movie Star

T his happened in '05. This is true as I tell it. In '05, I became a fan of the famous movie star, Rosalind Russell. I love her in the movie-musical GYPSY. One of my favorite songs from the show that Rose sings (Rosalind's character) is ""Everything's Coming Up Roses"".

Well, one day, I decided to interpret the role of Louise while my Mom was at work (I was home alone). When it came to the line, ""Now's your inning. Stand the world on its ear!"", I SWEAR I felt someone wrap their arms around me! I even had the fan off! It then came to another line, and I felt someone's hands in mine. I then saw someone identical to Rosalind.

Another day, I wanted to know if I was imagining the whole Rosalind thing that day. I held my hand out. Then I felt a hand, very cold, like ice in Antarctica, in my hand. I didn't see anyone but just felt a hand.

This year of '07, I was on the computer surfing. All of a sudden, I heard the door shut. My Mom wasn't there, neither was my Grandma or Grandpa! I have a cat, but there could be no way that she could've done it.

Was it the spirit of Rosalind Russell that caused all of this? Or just a random ghost? I would like to know. You're the ghost experts, so please tell me.

A Visit from my Cousin,"California, United States",Family / Friends Visits,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Family / Friends Visits :: A Visit from my Cousin

I have another story to share with you. I'll start it off by saying that me and my cousin Paul were very close. He was only a year older than I. We were living close to each other, our parents always had us in the same soccer teams when we were little, as we got older we started going to concerts together...(we both love music).

We both have completely different schedules with work and all. He had a girlfriend and I had a boyfriend but we always tried to keep in contact. Paul always made time to see how I was doing even if it was over the computer.

Last year I was driving home from work when I got the worst phone call of my life. My mom crying on the phone told me to pullover. I already knew something wasn't right so I screamed for her to let me know what had happened. She told me that my cousin had got into a car accident, and had passed away. I flipped. I freaked out, I started punching my car window. I knew I had to pull over and just try to breath. I couldn't understand that someone so young, only 21 had died.

My cousin Paul who I was very close to. I had so many questions to ask. I asked God why? Why did it have to be Paul? Along with a zillion more questions. I just had to accept that it was Heaven's gain.

So straight to the point now, it was about a month after Paul's accident, the night before my first day of my new job as a Custody Officer. The night before I was very nervous, scared because I didn't know what to expect. I finally fell asleep. The next morning I woke up to the most beautiful dream ever. I was sitting on a couch when out of nowhere Paul sits next to me. I knew he had passed and I was very surprised to see him. He looked great, big smile, even looked as though he lost some weight. People say after death people are more healthy looking. I told Paul that I missed him so much and that I love him. I also asked him how Heaven was like? He replied ""Man, it's great, it's amazing. I just have a lot to do"".

I then asked him if it hurt when he died. His reply was a smile ""Nope"". I was glad to hear that. I had one more question to ask him, the most important one I had. I asked him if he was going to be there when it was my turn to pass on. He looked at me and said ""Duh fool"" and nudged my arm. It was something he always did to me while he was alive. After my questions he disappeared.

I woke up the next morning and told me mom right away. I know it was more than a dream, that it was my cousin telling me he was alright and for the rest of the family not to worry.

Let's just say after his visit, I wasn't nervous about my new job anymore, I actually went in with a smile. I know my story was a bit long but I hope you enjoyed it.

Mum's Experience,Australia,Family / Friends Visits,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Family / Friends Visits :: Mum's Experience

I 'm telling this story on behalf of my mum. Believe me, my mum doesn't tell lies and she isn't one for making up crap about ghosts. She told me this story after I had told her about somebody coming to me.

John (mum's dad) died before my sister, who is mum's first child. Mum was pregnant with her when he passed away. One night mum was laying in bed after putting Debbie to sleep. She felt someone sitting on the end of her bed. She thought it might have been Doug Debbie's father, home from the pub exceptionally early and being very quiet. So she ignored the matter and just laid there again trying to go to sleep. After about five minutes, she could still feel somebody sitting there, she thought to herself ""what on earth is Doug doing"". So she sat up and looked, no one was there but there was a like a ditch on the bed, like somebody was sitting there. She laid back down then someone started talking to her.

""You have a wonderful daughter"" it said, ""I trust you will raise her well, same with any other children you may have, take good care of your mum for me"" That's all the voice said to her. As soon as the voice had said ""take good care of your mum for me"" mum knew it was her father, because when he would go away for a few weeks he would say that to her. Then she felt the bed move, he had gotten off it and she said he must have walked over to Debbie's cot because never would she move while she was sleeping, but she sat there rubbing her cheek like someone had touched her. Mum is assuming that he had walked over to Debbie and obviously stroked her face.

I'm the only one mum has ever told that story, being a ghost believer. She never told Debbie because she doesn't believe in that stuff.

One of my Previous Houses,United Kingdom,Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: One of my Previous Houses

I am new to this site, but have been interested in psychic matters for several years. I thought you might be interested to hear about one of my former homes. It was an ex-council house built in the 1960's, which is relatively modern but it needed a lot of redecorating. However, it meant that it was cheap for such a big house. When we viewed the property, the house seemed OK but for some reason I felt uneasy in the back bedroom.

We were desperate to move and our budget was low, so despite my dad asking ""Are you sure?"" I jumped straight in. It turned out to be the worst 2 years of my life. The first day we moved in, I realized that we had made a mistake. I could deal with the dirt, but the place left me feeling depressed and withdrawn.

After a few weeks, we noticed that the atmosphere would become repressive at certain times of the day. It would literally go from being quite bright to miserable. We had 2 birds, whose cages were kept in the living room. They changed from being happy to being withdrawn and quiet. When I practiced my flute in the upstairs box-room, I could hear someone walking around in the room next door. Whenever I investigated, there would be no one there and my husband would be sitting on the computer downstairs.

At night, I would shut the door to the back bedroom or pull it across the doorway when it was off its hinges because I had to walk past it to get to the bathroom. I also felt uneasy at the top of the stairs, like I was going to fall. Once, I saw something with long hair, but never told my husband.

Every evening, I would be laying on the sofa in the living room while my husband was on the computer and something cold would come in and sit by my feet. I also felt uneasy standing at the top of the stairs. Also, if you stood in the kitchen you could sometimes see ""something"" or someone standing in the hallway. The most frightening thing that happened to me there though was when I stood at the bottom of the stairs early one evening. I looked up and saw a shadowy column came out of the bathroom and move across the landing. I am not easily frightened, but will admit that after that I never stood in the hallway without the both the upstairs and downstairs lights on ever again!

The interesting thing is that my neighbors told me they used to hear someone walking across their upstairs hallway from the bathroom until they bought a dog and it stopped.

We managed to stay there for just under 2 years before moving house again. The new place was a like breath of fresh air. As soon as we moved into our new home, our birds changed back into happy little things again. During the first week in the new house my husband admitted that he'd seen ""something"" with long hair in the old one, but had not told me because he thought I'd be scared. Something cold used to touch his shoulder and he'd also felt uneasy at the top of the stairs.

A good friend told us he'd hated the old house and would not stand in the living room because he felt ""something"" there. I'd always wondered why he'd stood outside or in the garage! Another friend, who doesn't believe in spirit admitted that she'd hated the back bedroom.

I've moved again since. I am glad to say that this house is not haunted either!

Voodoo House,"California, United States",Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: Voodoo House

T his is very difficult for me to write because of the occurrences that transpired when I was in the house I am going to tell you about. When I was 6 years old until the time I was 12, I lived in a house in the East Bay of California. It was the 1980's and the house only had one previous tenant. It was only four years old when my parents decided to buy the house. Nothing seemed strange about the house at first. I slept in a room right across the hall from my parents and if anything were to happen I could yell and get their attention.

One night, about a year after moving in, me and my parents heard a large thud at the front door of the house. My father went to the front door (keep in mind that the time was about 11pm at night). When my father opened the door there was no one there, but when he looked down at the door mat there was a chicken with its head chopped off. My parent, having come from a very superstitious background, knew right away what this was; it was an attempt to invoke evil spirits into the house. We had no idea who would want to do this but it was obvious that they did not like us.

Two month later I was sleeping in my bedroom and that is when the occurrences began. I woke up in the middle of the night and when I look into my closet I saw a tall woman with a white dress staring into the closet. I was so scared, I thought I was dreaming at first but I rubbed my eyes and pinched myself and I felt the pain and knew I was not dreaming or seeing things; this was real! Instead of yelling I just went back to sleep.

The next night I slept with my parent and I told them the story. They said that maybe it was the voodoo, but even at my age, I was a bit skeptical. I should have not been because about three months after the first incident I woke up again in the middle of the night and right beside my bed was a woman with white hair and her body was transparent. She looked demonic and the moonlight was shining right through her. Her hand was reaching out for me and again I check to see if I was awake. I was, and I tried to wake my parents up but they would not wake up, after that attempt, I passed out from being so frightened.

I told my parents what was happening and they had the house blessed. This helped for a little while but the occurrences started happening again. This time with everyone in my family experiencing what I did. My sister, who is 16 months younger then me, went to the backyard in the middle of the night to feed my dog, when she looked up and saw misty forms reaching out toward her. She yelled and ran back to tell my parents.

Other times my whole family would be eating and a black form would step in front of us and move away and my parent would say; ""hey, did you see that!"" We would always say yes, after a while we got used to those occurrences. However, there were even more terrifying events.

My mother one time was saying goodbye to my family friends and something rubbed up against her and went inside the house. There was no one there. Another time my family was having a New Years Party and, on the glass door in the backyard were three big knocks. My family and extended family were right in front of the glass door and saw no one on the other side. We look at the backyard and no one was there. Sometime there would be knocks on the front door in the middle of the night. This became annoying after a while and my parents and I stopped answering the door.

Another time I got possessed and had no control over my body and began speaking words from my mouth that I had no control over and my body moved without me being able to control it. Yet, another time, when my uncle was over, I had to sleep by my parents. I woke up in the middle of the night and looked at the ground and I saw something crawling toward me. It looked evil, I can't describe it other then saying that it was foul looking. The last thing that really impacted me what when I was taking a shower and the water became so hot I got burnt. No matter how much I turned the cold water high, it still was scolding hot. My babysitter tried to find out what was going on too. When we looked at the water heater, the heat knob was turned all the way up. In front of the heater were big empty water bottles and none of them were out of place. That meant that no one physical could have moved that knob.

I can't tell you anymore because so many things happened in that house and we moved after having lived there for 6 years. Until this day, I cannot sleep with the light off. I will be traumatized by that place for the rest of my life. If anyone reading this story has similar occurrences please move out! Do not stay! It will always be with you in your memories. That is the only reason I am writing this.

The Demon Boy,Canada,Demons / Possessions / Exorcisms,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Demons / Possessions / Exorcisms :: The Demon Boy

O n september 12 of this year I started feeling very sick and tired. I wanted to rest for a couple of days and I got sicker and sicker. My grandma came over one day (she's a medium) and wanted to see how I felt, but as soon she came into the house, she felt cold and scared all over.

She said that there was a demon or some evil entity in my house. It was the one that was making me sick. She did some investigations or something and said that it was a boy and probably died in the streets or in the house (This house was built in the late 1800's). I was scared and on some nights when my grandma goes home I would hear footsteps and my name being called and I was scared out of my wits. I got sicker and sicker and eventually it got so bad I had to go to the hospital.

Well I started feeling better when I got of the house and when I went back home it felt like my inside were burning. I was sleeping and I woke up to my whole body burned and ached all over. Then I saw a shadow by my doorway and it was a little boy but he was wearing black and he had these lonely fiery eyes. It felt really scary to look into the eyes of a demon. I eventually moved and he follows me wherever. No matter were I move, I am always sick and he makes me worse everyday! Just recently my grandma visited a priest and he comes over and wants to get rid of this demon boy. I will keep everyone posted if some people want.

The Haunted School,Canada,Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: The Haunted School

I just thought about another of my experiences! It was pretty scary. This all started on October 2 of 2005, this was at my old school Isaac Newton in winnipeg Manitoba. I was just starting an extra activity after school, so I am the only one there beside for the janitor. I was working on the set in the drama room and I was painting. All of a sudden I just felt really cold and the room turned ice cold. I thought there was some windows opened and went to shut them, but nothing was open. So I just went back to work and started painting again.

Just as I picked up my brush I heard this deathly hollow noise coming from the basement! I was scared. I went to investigate and out of the corner of my eye I seen something run around the the art room. So I went into the room and seen nothing and them someone pushed me and I was scared. I thought it was someone sneaking into the school, pulling a prank. But no one was there! I then turned around and heard someone running around up stairs like big stomping and yelling and laughing. I went back to the room and tried calling the janitor but he left and locked the doors so no one could get into the school. I went back painting and I heard the scariest sound ever. It was like a scream and a dying animal at the same time.

I ran to the doors and peeked outside and in the glass reflection I seen a person standing there! It looked like a middle aged man and he was very dirty looking and really angry. He then started walking to me and I just booked it right there. I ran outside and it looked like he was going to follow me but then he vanished!

When I went there the next day, I talked to my principle and he said I witnessed the ghost of Peter. She told me that he was an angry bitter man and was the old janitor and he died in the school when he had a heart attack and fell down the stairs. Believe me I never stayed and finished my project! It was scary! It doesn't explain for the stomping and yelling and laughing of children! I'll save that for another day.

Transparent Hand,"California, United States",Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: Transparent Hand

A bout seven years ago, one of my neighbor told me a story of the house that we lived in. And we still live in that house today. She told me that there was an accident that had happened there before. My neighbor had forbidden me to tell anyone about the story that she is going to tell me, and she said to me that she will never tell me the accident in my home or near my home because the house might hear and might even come after me. I did not believe her, but I kept her words.

Some weeks passed by, I start seeing odd things. One of my first time was seeing a strange woman's shadow at my brother's window. I suspected nothing, and told no one because I know that no one will believe me. A couple of days later my family went to the laundry, and left me home alone. I was sitting on my brother's bed, when all of a sudden, I saw a shadow. It was a hand no bigger than mine reaching out to grab me. I jumped off and start cussing that it was nothing, nothing at all, and that it cannot scare me. But saying that was a big mistake.

I went to my grandma's house the next weekend, I was in the bath tub, just turned off the faucet and turned around when all of a sudden, the faucet turned itself on. A big fright jumped out of my veins. I turned around and there was nothing. I told myself that it's okay. But it was not, I again turned around, and there, it turned itself back on again. I quickly turned around and there was a hand, no bigger than mine, transparently turning the faucet off. I ran out to tell my grandma but she said, ""It's nothing, it's just rats...""

I still said nothing to my parents. Months within months has passed, still I said not a word to anyone, but it keeps getting worse. I see ahead of me, and I hear behind my back. Everywhere I go, if there is a corner, I will see a white hand sticking out and waving at me. Every time I go to sleep, it sleeps next to me, snoring, and every time I wake up, it wakes up with me. I tell myself that it's nothing, it's probably that I breath too loud, but it wasn't. I even hold on my breath to test!

It just keeps getting worse and worse until I told my mom, that I am scared. She was shocked by then, I told her that I am scared to be by myself and that something uncanny keeps following me. After that, she called the shaman to help me. After he helped me, I started being normal, I don't hear or see anything no more.

But strange uncanny things still happens before another accident occurs. Before my dad passed away, I can hear it breathing loudly on my sister's bed. But after he passed away, I never heard it again. Also before my grandpa passed away, I can hear two people talking, and I can hear the ritual witchcraft that the shamans uses during their chanting.

About a couple of days later, he passed away. Once in a while, it still comes back to haunt me in my dream.

Shadows in my Life,"Florida, United States",A Haunted Life,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: A Haunted Life :: Shadows in my Life

I t seemed to begin in my teen years. When I was 15 (I am 33 now) I had an experience that I could not explain. One night, on a school night, I went to bed and I started getting scared because the posters in my room started making this fluttering noise as if there was wind being blown behind them, not crazy wind but subtle. I stayed there scared stiff until I said to myself, ""I am not staying in here"", and went to lay down in the family room where my brother's were at (they happened to be staying over night that particular night). They were known to be pranksters but there is no possibility that they had anything to do with that. Besides, they were laying down to sleep, lights out.

I told my brothers what happened and they stayed up with me because I was scared and couldn't go to sleep. Later, one of my brothers' saw a figure in the hallway right outside my bedroom door. I thought I saw it too. Needless to say I did not get any sleep that night and when morning came I had to start getting ready for school. I had hamsters at the time, one was smaller than the other because I just got him (the little one), and the other one I had for a while. They were in a wired cage, kind of like something similar to a bird cage but not, I had the hamsters separated in the middle of the cage, little one on top and bigger one on the bottom. It was separated by a wire floor, the same wire that the cage was build of, the gaps between the wire were probably about a 1/4"" or less apart from each other. There is a point to why I am explaining dimensions of the cage floor separating the two hamsters! When I went to feed them the little hamster's head was missing, no blood, no skull to be found. The other hamster was fine. I thought he could have done it but there was no way he could have pulled the hamsters skull through the wire floor but I tried to rationalize it and started looking for the skull in the bottom part of the cage and it was nowhere to be found.

Another incident was when I was 19 years old and living in a different house. I started waking up every once in a while between the hours of 2:30-3:00 in the morning and having the urge to look in a specific location, the location where the ""Shadow Person"" was standing. It started in the corner of the bedroom and then eventually got closer. I moved again when I was 21 years old into an apartment and one night I was awakened at the same time as usual by another ""Shadow Person"" but this time it was right at the foot of the bed. I was sleeping in the middle of the bed because my daughter wanted to sleep with us that night. I said to the figure thinking it was my husband, being half awake and only the moonlight showing through the blinds, ""What are you doing?"", then I turned over to feel my husband right next to me. At this moment I turned around and sat up, actually not afraid, and as soon as I did that it darted off towards the bedroom door disappearing halfway to the bedroom door. I jumped up and went out to see if someone was in the house but there wasn't anything.

A couple of nights later, around the same time in the a.m. I was watching T.V. in our bedroom. I felt hot so I went to turn the A.C. down. When I opened the door and turned on the hall light I heard this song playing ""It's a Small World"". I went towards the sound baffled because we did not have that song in our house from any toy or anything. When I found the source of where it was coming from I was really freaked out because about a year before that I had bought a ceramic clown that was supposed to play music, what song I don't know because I bought it broken. It was a ceramic clown that had a head that rocked back and forth and there was a long ceramic piece that went in the top of the body and it had a magnet at the end which activated the mechanics inside for the song to play. It was battery operated and because it was broken I did not have batteries in it. I could not get it to stop playing so I took the head out and eventually after a couple of minutes it stopped.

Another time was when I was staying the night at my boyfriend's house(I had just turned 26 and by the way I'm divorced from my husband now) and we were sleeping in the same bed. I was sleeping on my stomach as usual, and I was woken up by something grabbing me under my arms starting to lift me, which they did barely off the bed, before I woke up. When I turned around I saw this big, black sheet looking thing hovering over the bed more so above my boyfriend, when I started to wake up my boyfriend it disappeared.

The next day I didn't say anything because I thought this was the worst yet of all the experiences so I was thinking maybe when I woke up possibly I was just seeing things because I was half awake. Later that day my boyfriend and I went outside to smoke a cigarette and they mentioned what they saw and it was exactly the same thing I saw. That really upset me because now I knew it was real and it was different than before AND it physically touched me! I started falling asleep with he T.V. on after that because I didn't want to sleep in the dark and if I was in the same bed as someone I didn't want to fall asleep last.

The next incident happened not too long after this one, it usually happened once a year but it started getting more frequent. My boyfriend stayed the night at my house and had to be at work the next morning. I stayed asleep that morning while he was at work and my daughter was at her Dad's for the weekend so I was by myself in the house. While I was sleeping I heard something towards the bedroom door, I thought it was my boyfriend coming home because he got off at noon, I felt a kneeling at the opposite end of the bed and then it was like someone crawling up the bed and then spooning me but it didn't feel like a solid form like a solid person. I opened my eyes, saw that it was only around 10AM and realized that it probably wasn't my boyfriend so I rolled over right into whatever was spooning me and I went into this state of partial unconsciousness, so it seemed. It felt like death, like I was dying and I knew that it had to do with this being, maybe I was feeling what it felt like or what it was itself. I don't know if I was feeling what it went through or what but it seemed like a long fight to shake it off which I finally did.

One time I was at a friend's house to stay over. The house they were renting was an old frame house that stood off the ground. It was early in the morning, around 2-3AM and we were in the kitchen making something to drink. I started cracking a tray of ice and I heard, behind me something say, ""SHHHH..."" in my ear and I felt the breath on my neck. There were other times in that house I heard people in the back of the house talking, pretty much only a female voice but when I went back there it would stop. The dog would bark at the walls. I really felt threatened in that house, more so a bad feeling, bad vibe. I'm getting goose bumps just talking about it.

Fast forward to the future and I am ""28"" and married again and have a baby and a toddler. Nothing had happened in a while until one morning I was sitting on the couch facing the backyard feeding my infant when I saw my older daughter's cat crossing the backyard, he had been missing for a year by now. I jumped up and opened the sliding glass door and it had disappeared. I thought, ""Could it have jumped over the privacy fence that quick?"", it was too far away from the fence though but I brushed that off thinking maybe he did. He has only been seen once or twice since.

Later that morning my daughter and I were watching the T.V. series ""ANGEL"" before she went to school. I had to get up to change my toddler's diaper. While he was on the changing table he looked towards the door of his bedroom and was just staring towards my daughter's bedroom so I turned and looked to see nobody and I turned back to my son on the changing table but then I heard my daughter's T.V. get louder, like someone opening the door and I turned only to see a silhouette of a female figure standing what seemed like right in the room a little past the door, but enough to cast a shadow from the ceiling light in the room. It stood there for merely seconds and I thought maybe my daughter went into her room to do something but forgot what she went in there for. Then the silhouette of this being walked in so when I was done changing my son's diaper, he ran in there and I went in after him to get him out before he got into her stuff (pre-teens, lots of junk) and there wasn't anyone in there. Baffled, I went into the living room and saw my daughter sitting in the same exact position as she was when I went out of the room. I asked her if she went in her room and she said no.

I told her what happened and she then proceeded to tell me what happened when she woke up to go to the bathroom at 6AM. She said she saw, by the foyer, what looked to be, well, ""ME"", which it wasn't of course, when she looked back it was gone. Later that morning, after my daughter went to school, I was sitting in the living room with my two dogs, my son and my infant daughter and (my husband was in our bedroom still sleeping). I heard our door shut (you know how after a while you know what sound each door makes), our bedroom door didn't open and then shut because it was shut to keep the noise down so my husband could sleep. Me, my son and dogs looked towards the hallway waiting for my husband to appear because I thought he got up, all of us looking, he never appeared. I got up to see what was up and I opened my bedroom door only to see my husband still sleeping and snoring very loudly. I didn't know what to think of that crazy morning but I have never felt threatened since I've been in this house and with my husband.

I very rarely see, hear or feel anything anymore and it may be because I am so busy with my kids. I don't know but I'm not complaining. Even when I do hear noises at night I don't really think much of it or maybe I'm too tired to pay it any attention.

I've had other experiences in my life but I have given you the strangest and ones that can't be explained. Another thing I'd like to mention is that everything I ever saw were black and I've read and heard that black was bad but are shadow people, the ones that do not have enough energy to manifest themselves, bad? I don't really think so but I know that I have felt threatened at times in the past. I've always wanted to share my experiences through a book or something because I think it is fascinating what I've experienced but I never did.

I'm glad I could share it with you! Thank you for your time. =)

Pet Ghosts Say Goodbye,"Kentucky, United States",Pets / Animals,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Pets / Animals :: Pet Ghosts Say Goodbye

A few years ago, my pet dog died. The next year on the anniversary of her death, I was going to school. When I got out of the car, me and my mom heard something (we were the two people closest to the dog). It was a bark. Only me and my mom heard it. My brother, in the backseat didn't hear it. The bark was the dead dogs bark. Nobody around the school owns a dog. I looked around, there was no dog around.

A few years later my cat died. On the same day as his death, I went in my room. Beside my closet, I saw something. It disappeared in thin air. It was my dead cat's tail. It looked as though the cat was in my closet and the tail was curled around the door. Then, I felt peace as if my cat had said goodbye. I believe my dog and cat spoke to me in ghost form.

What do you think? I need help and advice about this. Also one time I was in a play. Everyone said the theater was haunted by a girl who had black braids. I didn't believe them. Then when I was rehearsing we had a break. When I turned around, I saw the ghost. Nobody else did see her. At first I walked away. But she followed me. I was really freaked out. Then when I was alone, I felt cold air glide through me. The ghost was in front of me! She had gone through me! I ignored her and was tripped when nothing was there.

When I went home the ghost followed. To this day the ghost is still here. Also I see more ghosts now too. Help!

Green Lights Flashing,"Illinois, United States",Poltergeists / Physical Manifestations,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Poltergeists / Physical Manifestations :: Green Lights Flashing

N ow, I didn't experience this first hand but my sister did and she is not one to lie about these things. Especially since she came home crying. She went over to her friend's house to check up on things. She was protecting it from robbers and feeding their animals while they were on vacation (it was summer). She had just got done feeding their black and white tabby cat named yin yang. She went into her friend's room to dust some things off.

That's when she heard the water running in the kitchen. She thought that maybe it was yin yang messing with the faucets, since he usually did. When she turned around yin yang was sitting at her feet. That's when she started to get nervous. She cautiously went into the kitchen. She turned the corner ready for a confrontation. When she did there wasn't anything there.

She ran over and turned the faucets off. She started to walk through the house looking for an intruder. She didn't even get out of the kitchen before all the cupboards started opening and closing. She started to panic and threw herself on the ground covering her head. She heard yin yang hissing and when she looked up there was a green light that filled the room. It flashed on and off as the cupboards opened and closed. Then as quickly as it started it ended. She didn't waste any time, she grabbed the cat and ran out of the house. She didn't stop running until she was safe back in her own house.

When her friend came back she confronted her about what happened. She was shocked to find out that it had been happening a few times a month since they bought the house. That's why they had gone on vacation, to get a break from it all. They apologized for not telling her and my sister never went back there again. Two months later my sister's friend and her family moved out.

The Man in the Black Hat,"Tennessee, United States",Apparitions / Voices / Touches,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Apparitions / Voices / Touches :: The Man in the Black Hat

T his happened in the late eighties or early nineties. My brother and I were on our way home from Prudential Hollow. We had been there the biggest part of the day, just messing around the old home places. Prudential was on land company and the hollow was shut down back in 1975/6 and all the remaining houses burned to the ground. It was getting late and we decided to head back home, a good half hour to 45 minute walk.

We were walking and talking, not paying too much attention to what was going on around us, after all we had made this walk plenty of times before. We had made it to the head of the hollow and was walking up the straightaway that lead to Silas Hollow and the turn off going to our house. We were snapped back to reality when we heard something coming down the side of the hill to our right. We looked to where the sound came from, thinking that it was a wild animal, and saw an old man come off the hillside, step into the roadway and start walking toward us. He was wearing a broadcloth type coat and a old black slough hat, with the brim shading his face. He walked hunched over, with his hands clinched behind his back. No big deal - just another guy out for a walk.

As we neared each other my brother and I eased to the left so he could pass to the right. We spoke, a causal ""Hi how's it going"" and he muttered and nodded his head as he passed. Both of us felt uneasy but kept it to ourselves. About a minute passed without either of us saying anything and I asked my brother if he knew the man and he said no, that he had never seen him before. We walked for a couple of more minutes, I guess three or four when we heard the same noise again and automatically looked to the hillside and that same man walked off the hill, stepped into the road and started walking toward us again.

Well this time we didn't speak and my brother whispered for me to not look him in the eye. After he passed us the second time my bother looked at me and said something like ""Frank something ain't right about this. Let's get out of here as fast as we can"". I agreed and we ran almost to the house. We got within eyesight of the house and my brother said that he thought we were safe enough now to stop and catch our breath.

After we rested a few minutes, we went to his house and set on his porch and tried to comprehend what had just happened. At the time we couldn't come up with any answers so his wife suggested we go talk to our Mother. We did and she told us that the man we saw had been seen by our Dad and older brother years before and that she had no idea of who or what he is.

I know it's been over twenty years since I have seen this specter but I still can't get it out of my mind. Who is he? What is he? What would have happened if I had made eye contact with him?",https://www.yourghoststories.com/real-ghost-story.php?story=2119
The Whispering Window,United Kingdom,Apparitions / Voices / Touches,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Apparitions / Voices / Touches :: The Whispering Window

I t was about 2.30 am in july and I had just got off school for summer holidays and all my family were asleep. Because of my insomnia I couldn't get any sleep but I tried. I had closed my eyes for five minutes, that's when I saw are back security light come on. I thought it was odd because everyone was asleep and our cat was in my room. I ignored it thinking it was someone else's cat.

Oh how wrong I was. Unless cats can talk, it was one but I highly doubt that. I then saw a shadow, just one shadow and they were whispering I couldn't understand what they were saying, it was a different language, nothing I had ever heard before, then I saw someone else walk over to my window. Now I was really scared and I couldn't move, I didn't want to look out my window because I knew they were looking right at me, then they stopped looking at my window and started talking, well, whispering.

I was straining to hear what they were saying, I picked up some of their words, it was ""sorry, dead, angels"" I had no idea what I should do, so I sat there, watching them talk, they were moving with grace and my room was so cold when I first saw them. Once they had left, my room warmed up, I was in shock but I got some sleep, though not that much.

I woke up at 9am. I went where my family was and I acted like nothing happened. I haven't seem or heard the people since but a lot of strange things have happened to me.

Little Scary Girl,"Illinois, United States",Misc,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Misc :: Little Scary Girl

T his story is very creepy and it still freaks me out until this day. When I was around 17 years old me and my boyfriend would sit in front of my house until wee hours of the night, it was summer time so it's not like we had school. My boyfriend Nicky only lived about four blocks down from me, I lived on 28th and he lived on 25th, but on the same block. Whenever he would go home I would watch him walk down the street until I couldn't see him, which normally meant he was already home so then I would go inside.

One night he came around 11pm and stood over until like 4 in the morning, so by the time he was going home I was so tired that I didn't watch him go home. When Nicky was on the 27th street he noticed a little girl walking down the street bouncing a ball coming towards him, he was like ""ok it's 4 in the morning why is this little girl out"" and as he got closer he noticed the little girl had two pig tales, but they were sticking up in the air like horns by this time, he didn't even want to pass her, as he got closer he felt every hair on his body rise and was scared out of his wits, he said when he passed her up, she looked up at him with her eye balls at the end of her eyes, he said as soon as he passed her he ran all the way home... And called me and told me what had just happened after that we never stood out no later then 10 o'clock.

You Mean I Was Here Alone?,"Massachusetts, United States",Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: You Mean I Was Here Alone?

H ere's another story from my ex's house. One night we had a few friends over and had a few beers, I had 2 or maybe 3. It was getting late and I had a few things to do before bed, so my ex offered to drive our friend home, while I stayed behind with the baby and finished up some laundry.

As he left I asked him if he would bring the laundry basket upstairs for me since I just hurt my back and couldn't really bend over. He said sure, and walked out of the house. About 20 minutes later, the baby's sleeping, and I'm just sitting in our room, cleaning up a little. I heard some banging coming form the bathroom next door, and thought...""Wow he's getting towels ready for the wash!"" I was IMPRESSED to say the least! So the banging and bumping goes on for a good 10-15 minutes, I'm thinking... ""Ok his mom must be home there's no way he's actually cleaning the bathroom"". So I look out the window and see his car, confused I walk out of the bedroom just in time to hear him put his key in the front door, and pick up the laundry basket to bring it up stairs.

When he got to the top of the stairs I said to him ""You just got home right this second?"" He said ""Yeah sorry it took me so long, I stopped at the store"". I froze with fear. I had been alone in the house for a good half hour listening to banging and bumping coming from the room next door and had no idea I was alone the whole time!

The Little Glowing Girl on a Swing,"Illinois, United States",Apparitions / Voices / Touches,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Apparitions / Voices / Touches :: The Little Glowing Girl on a Swing

W hen I was little, about 6 or 7, I went trick or treating alone. While I was out, I felt like someone was watching me, but I just ignored it. I just went on with my trick or treating, when I came up to this strange house. When I passed it, it was like it dropped at least 30 to 40 degrees. It was an old country house with a huge tree and tire swing in the front yard.

When I went up to the door and rang the doorbell, this little girl dressed in a white dress and was glowing in the moonlight was laughing and playing on the swing and there was a glowing white man pushing her on it. I dropped my candy bag and ran when I saw my name printed clearly on the cement. I ran at least 3 blocks home and called 911.

When they came to investigate the scene, everything I described was gone. No name in the cement, no little girl or man. The police men said nothing had ever happened at this house and said it was all my imagination, but I guess I will never know about this strange day. My friends said I was crazy, but I believe something terrible may have happened to this little girl and father. Also when I got home the lights flickered on and off and I kept hearing the strange scream during the middle of the night.

I'd like to figure out more, but I believe if I do, they will haunt me until the day I die.

Footsteps into my Room,"California, United States",Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: Footsteps into my Room

N ow this story begins from my childhood. My parent brought me home October 9th, 1980 to the house they owned in Chula Vista, Ca. Ever since I can remember there have been strange ongoings and noises in that house. What I am about to share with you is my first experience I had that I can remember.

I was about 5 years old, so it was 1986, my room was in the middle of the house right next to the bathroom and my parent's room. I was laying down on my bed watching tv when I heard heavy footsteps, like a man in boots was walking from the back of the house into my room. As they started, I remember looking up to the door expecting my father to walk in, however no one did and the footsteps stopped in my doorway. My room was carpeted, but the rest of the house had hardwood floors and it was literally as if someone walked right up and into my room from the back of the house and yet no one was standing there before me as I looked up.

I got up off the floor and slowly walked into the living room to see if my dad had just walked by, but I found he was laying on the couch passed out. I ran back into my room and pulled the blankets over my head and tried to go to sleep. I heard nothing else that night.

M y first story Footsteps into my Room was in 1986, the second story I have was in the summer of 93. I was 12 years old, my dad had divorced and remarried, I moved from my bedroom into the back bedroom that was an addition on to the house. I had to switch rooms because my dad and his new wife had a baby together, my brother, Gregg. It was late at night in the summer so I was off school.

I was asleep in my bed when I woke up to see my Akita, shojo (sho), standing on top of me with its hair standing up and looking from the window back to me and growling at the window. I grabbed sho by the collar and walked her back out to the back room, which was attached to my room, her struggling all the way, and seeming like she didn't want to leave me. I tried to lie back down, but she kept growling, hair on end and still looking out the window. I figured it was just a cat or a skunk that was upsetting her so I took a flashlight and went outside, but I saw nothing there so I dragged sho outside and ran back into the house, shut the door and locked it.

Not but 2 steps back inside the house she began howling and barking, I looked out my window and she was looking at me. Feeling bad I went back outside and let her back in the house. I tried to have her lay down on the floor of my bedroom right next to my bed, but she wouldn't lay down she just stood there, eyes still trained on the window, hair standing up and growling.

I laid on my bed and closed my eyes trying to get back to sleep when even through my closed eyes, I could see a light had been turned on in my room. I opened my eyes, looked over and saw that my fish tank light had come on, so I got up and clicked the button and the light turned off. I lay back down and turned over on my side so my back was facing sho and put the pillow over my head.

All of a sudden the fire alarm went off, I jumped up out of bed and being completely freaked out, ran into my dad's room and got my step mom. She took the fire alarm down, took the battery out and laid it on the dryer that was in the backroom where sho slept. My step mom went back to bed and I sat on my bed, staring at the fire alarm, almost expecting for it to go off again. Sho was still growling, hair on end, staring out the back window, I was so frightened I began praying, ""Lord if there is anything here that is not of you please let it be gone, in your name Jesus, Amen..."" As soon as I said Amen, sho's hair went down on her back, she turned around, licked my face and went and laid in her usual spot in the back room.

In the morning when I woke up I went to turn on my fish tank light so I could feed my fish and realized that the light burnt out the week before and I had the light sitting at the side of my bed. I couldn't even believe that it hadn't been in there even though somehow the light came on that night.

My Cousin Kenny,"New York, United States",Family / Friends Visits,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Family / Friends Visits :: My Cousin Kenny

H i Again, This is my second submission to this site. My first was about my sister's ""bargain"" haunted house . This story is much more personal but I feel good about the people who share this site, so I will post it here. Feel free to share thoughts about this story. I only hope that none of my relatives read this site because this story might upset them. I have never told them about these experiences.

The story begins late in the night/very early morning, after midnight, January 1, 1977 (New Years Eve). I am 8 years old at the time, I will turn 9 at the end of January that year. My mother, my brother and myself were living in the basement apartment of my grandmother's house. We are all sound asleep when we are suddenly awakened by shrieking from upstairs where my grandmother lives. We are all three woken up and we head up the stairs at a run. My grandmother is on her knees on the kitchen floor (I know this is really bad) on the phone, shrieking and crying. My mother, ashen, moves toward my grandmother and gently takes the phone from her. She speaks into the phone. My uncle is on the line. He tells my mother that my cousin Kenny has been killed in an accident, by a drunk driver. He was 17 years old.

This instance begins the inward collapse of a portion of my family. The house is in chaos that night. My mother tells me and my brother what has happened. My brother, who is just 7 at the time, is distraught. Once it begins to dawn on me what has happened, I immediately curse God and fall to the floor, blacking out. My cousin was the source of much joy and love in our family and my brother and I fiercely loved him.

The wake, funeral and burial are held over the next few days... My brother and I are not allowed to attend any of it. I tell my mother I want to be a part of saying goodbye, but she tells me I am too young.

Here begins, I suppose, the ghost story portion of this tale. In the basement apartment, my brother and I shared a room. His bed was near the door. My bed was against the far wall, opposite the door. At the foot of my bed was a tall children's wardrobe, one side was a tall set of drawers, the other side was a vertical closet with a door. Since it stands at the foot of my bed, you know that I make certain every night that the closet door is shut tight... otherwise, how is a young child to sleep? With a dark and creepy closet door ajar? I think not!

So, yes, I would close the door every night before I climbed beneath the covers. Then, one night, a few days after my cousin was laid to rest, I woke in the middle of the night with the closet door ajar, open. I looked and saw a figure in the closet. It moved forward toward me in the bed and stopped a few feet away from where I lay. I was not afraid... It was my cousin who had been killed. So his appearance just made me feel sad. I cried out of sadness and he gave me a tender look. Then he began to speak to me. He told me that I should not have cursed God, that God had nothing to do with his dying. He said it was just an accident. Then he told me that he loved me very much and that he had come to say goodbye. I think that I told him I loved him too and then cried some more, but told him goodbye also. We talked a bit more, but it is difficult to remember. After a while, he seems to go, I seem to fall back to sleep, and the next I recall, it is morning.

This same scenario plays out every few nights, almost the same every time, for the next month. Until finally it does not happen anymore.

I think this happened because my cousin was torn so quickly from his family that he needed to linger, but also because I blamed God and my cousin wanted to make sure I did not curse God for his accident. Then I think it was just because we had a special bond, he and I. I am not sure. And no one else in my family has spoke of having similar experiences with him after he was killed. Then again, if they did, they might be just as reluctant as I am to talk about it. Kenny's death was one of the major traumas to happen to my family, so it would have been difficult to discuss real thoughts, much less talk about seeing his ghost.

What do folks think? It would be nice to hear some thoughts on this experience. This is the first time I am telling this story to anyone. :)

My Childhood Ghost 2,Canada,Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: My Childhood Ghost 2

R ead my first story . Guess what? I moved! And now this new house is even more haunted. My old ghost moved with us, since I see her more and more every week, my youngest friend saw her, well her face and now she is too scared to come into my room, I don't get it! This house is only a year old and already it's haunted.

When I was awake alone, I was in the bathroom and a noise of a dying cat was heard in the air vent... I was freaking out.

Something similar happened to me like in June when we moved in, I was home alone and I heard footsteps following me down the hall, so I grabbed the phone and ran in the bathroom, calling my friend, I could hear the cat faintly so I didn't mind it since I was to scared to think of the thing in the hallway. The woman appeared again to me when I was brushing my hair in front of my mirror (which I was to scared to hang it up so I left it on the floor) and saw her standing by the door, she didn't have a body.

My brother is being stalked by the ghost that was following me before, and my brother also heard the dying cat. It really scares me, so I hung up some things and also got fish, in hope that fish can make me confused of the spirits (I can feel when things or people are around, just not how much).
