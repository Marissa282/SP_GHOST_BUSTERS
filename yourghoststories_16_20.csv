Figure at my Bedside,"California, United States",Apparitions / Voices / Touches,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Apparitions / Voices / Touches :: Figure at my Bedside

T his is my one and only paranormal experience, thankfully, because I don't know if I could survive another! I was about 14 years old at the time (25 now) and was spending winter vacation at my grandparents house. Now, my grandparents house wasn't old, it wasn't reportedly haunted or even built on an indian burial ground - nothing dramatic, just a newer house built in the forest.

I was sleeping in the spare bedroom with my cousin and was slowly awakened, by what I don't remember, but suddenly I was WIDE AWAKE. There in the glow from the fire place lighting the room, there was a black figure walking from just outside the doorway to beside the bed - right beside me. This figure had no discernable features, but it was as big as the door frame and was just walking out to the hallway and back to the bedside. I was paralyzed with fear. My stomach would clench as the figure drew nearer and nearer, terrified that it would reach out and touch me. It would get close and then turn around again. I was scared, but not so much that I couldn't elbow my cousin and ask her to switch places with me! She just groaned and never woke up.

I don't know what or who it could have been but I couldn't have felt too threatened because I fell back asleep eventually. That's it, no big ending and I never encountered it again. As I get older I wonder could it have been someone in my family or even someone in my cousin's family (her other side) protecting us during the night? Something to discuss at holidays with the family!

A Ghost Scared of Yamraj,India,Old Hags / Night Attacks / Sleep Paralysis,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Old Hags / Night Attacks / Sleep Paralysis :: A Ghost Scared of Yamraj

I have heard the stories of ghosts and paranormal experiences of people in older times from my grandmother. But today, no one believes in such things because we are living in the 21st century where such incidents are considered to be a symbol of mockery. But the supernatural happening that occurred to me a few days back compelled me to believe that in this world, there is a real evil.

I was sleeping when I saw a man in my dream. He looked sad and flogged. He was painfully thin and there was a bruise on the side of his cheek, the size of a man's fist. He was trying to convince me of something. Then he looked back and told me ""Get Lost"" as he told that Yamraj (Hindu god of death) was approaching. His blutering hadn't worked so he began to whine. He then told that if I failed to rescue him from Yamraj, then he will haunt me every night and he won't let me sleep. I was terrified.

My dream broke from fear I felt even during the sleep. To my horror, I saw someone sitting beside my bed who looked still. His figure was similar to my father but he was not my dad. I recognized him from his cheek. He was the man which came in my dream. He looked so real that I asked him about his problem. Now with an aggressive face he turned towards me and he passed through my body. I was paralyzed. I gave out a loud shout which awakened my parents. They asked me why I shouted. When I told them all this, they were not convinced. They thought that I had seen a dream. But I'm sure that it was something more... More than a dream.

From that day, I never saw him again and he had never haunted me. Maybe god Yamraj has sent him to a proper place where he deserved to be!

Worse than Scared - Petrified,"Texas, United States",Old Hags / Night Attacks / Sleep Paralysis,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Old Hags / Night Attacks / Sleep Paralysis :: Worse than Scared - Petrified

I very much believe in the paranormal however, I have never had a negative experience until last night. I can't recall ever feeling so scared and helpless. I had been up and down all night as we just got a new puppy that I have to get up with approx. every 2 hours. After waking up one time I went back to sleep. The whole experience began as if a dream.

In the beginning of the dream I had gone outside to take the dog out (it was a totally different house, surroundings, etc). As I looked to the left I saw that I had apparently scared someone off as there was a lit cigarette sitting on the corner of the house to my left held by I don't know what. It was not on the ground - it appeared as if it was being held by a bracket sort of thing. I started getting scared at that time. I went back inside (this is still the dream) and I'm not sure what happened then. This is where it gets really scary.

I was in bed, my husband was beside me sound asleep (he is a hard sleeper). I was laying face down, yet I could hear noises (not loud, maybe like a shuffling) going on around me. I remember feeling at first as if there was 1 person, but shortly after I realized that there were 2. I remember feeling like I had been drugged. I couldn't wake up, move, or scream. It was so vivid. I remember fighting to wake up. I remember trying to make some sound and eventually trying with all of my strength to scream and I could make no sounds.

There were times that I was able to wake up and in one of these I put my arm around my husbands waist (I was still on my stomach). The consciousness didn't last long at all when it did come. After this I was trying so hard to move my arm or fingers to wake my husband up, but nothing would move and again I couldn't wake up or scream. I would occasionally hear things around me. I remember thinking that my husband and I had both been drugged (like the scene in the movie "" What Lies Beneath "" where Harrison Ford has drugged Michelle Pfeiffer and puts her in the bath tub and turns the water on). The only difference was that she had her eyes open and despite all my effort I couldn't open my eyes.

I can remember thinking that they had really drugged my husband so he wouldn't realize what was going on and were leaving him alone. I remember thinking to myself that whenever I had encountered spirits in the past none have been aggressive. There were a few times I was able to fight off the fatigue and I was eventually able to wake my husband up enough to tell him to save me and that 2 ghosts were trying to get me. Him, being the non believer that he is, told me that I needed to tell them to go away. He didn't seem to realize that I was petrified. I had been fighting this for what seemed to be forever. Each time I was scared to go back into the catatonic state but couldn't fight it off.

The one time that I was successful in getting my husband's attention he got up, went to the bathroom, came back and we laid facing each other with our arms around each other. I remember feeling the energy behind my back and repeatedly flinching like they were trying to get me away from my husband. I guess they eventually left because I was able to go to sleep feeling like it was safe.

An Orb Floating Above my Grandmother's Headstone,Ireland,Photographs / Videos / EVP,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Photographs / Videos / EVP :: An Orb Floating Above my Grandmother's Headstone

I t was March 3rd, 2007. Me and my family where at my grandmother's tomb on her memorial day. It was a sad day. We sang the songs she wrote in her journal. I took a picture of her tomb, and a strange light of ball appeared floating near it on the photo on my camera. Their was nothing their before I took anything. I have no idea what it is called. Does anybody know out there? I would like to know.

I'm glad to be sharing my photo I took with you. Can you help? I have written a story called: The Ireland Hunted House . Perhaps you would like to read that too. But I need help with this one.

This has never happened to me before. It's disturbing. What makes the thing appear? Why did it only show on my camera film? It's all too strange. I hope there's someone out there with similar experience. This is the first time a thing like this has happened to me. My photo is with this story, and I am not joshing about it. Me and my Aunt Mary where the only ones there. Does anybody know? My Aunt Mary is scared of it, she confiscated my camera from me. I'm mad at that. I have other photos also, with the same things happened.

I'm glad I found this web site. It helps me share my troubled feelings and thoughts I need to know. Please, I need help.

Famous Toys R Us Ghost in Sunnyville,"California, United States",Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: Famous Toys R Us Ghost in Sunnyville

I went to Sunnyville, California to visit their Toys 'R' Us store. I'm a ghost hunter. I went there with three of my cousins: Jess, Kayla, Sierra. We went inside the store to buy a couple of stuff to show the family when we would go back to Utah. As I went through the doll aisle, a doll came out of its package and landed on the floor right beside me! By itself! No joke. I was shaking all over, I ran to see my cousins and told them what happened. They thought I was joking around with them but they soon realized for themselves that I wasn't.

The store manager saw us group of girls all freaked out and clumped together.

The manager: ""Johnson, these girls were only here to buy. Sorry about him. Johnson haunts this store ever since they built this store over the land where his homeland was. Some say he died by a ax in his thigh. Who knows?""

""Yep. Just a warning, don't go through the Play-Doh aisle. Enter at your own risk. But you know, Johnson isn't the only ghost here. Their's a group of them with him. And don't go upstairs where the camera room is...""

We stood in front of the Play_Doh aisle. I took a picture with my camera it was amazing! An example of what my photo looked like . But Johnson the ghost wasn't leaning against the wall. Why do ghosts stay here with us?

The Ghostly Paulding Light,"Michigan, United States",Orbs / Lights / Mists,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Orbs / Lights / Mists :: The Ghostly Paulding Light

L ast month, with my family, we went to MI to see the Paulding Light. It's real! When my mum parked our car to see to the view of the light, that big, bright light seemed to zip right down on the power lines! It was so cool. I took a camera photo of it and and recorded it on our video cam. When the light started to race on the power line towards us, literally, it chased us! Man, it scared the heck out of us.

Now, when it comes to scare a 17 year old, that's pretty hard. But this spooked the devil out of me! When I first saw it, I thought it was an Orb. But people say its the ghost of a little boy searching the tracks high and low for his sister's head that was beheaded from the train running over her, killing both of them.

As the light started chasing us, you could hear its vibration and feel them! We ran to the car and drove home. Not looking back.

But what is it? What is it that makes that light truly stay their? Sometimes when I see things like ghosts or orbs, they stay here with unfinished business. I wish somehow that we could make that thing go away. But, why did it chase us? Why is it a light and not a ghost of the boy instead? I need help! Why, why?

Seriously, though, it spooked me. It reminded me of Casper the Friendly ghost. Except it wasn't friendly.

I Saw a Ghost,"New York, United States",Family / Friends Visits,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Family / Friends Visits :: I Saw a Ghost

I t's Christmas, 1991, in Buffalo NY. Family from all different states are celebrating the holiday at my parents' house, which I will mention is the same house my mother grew up in. I go upstairs to get my pajamas on and something catches the corner of my eye. I look in front of my bathroom door and see a man. He only appears from the chest and up; he isn't solid but isn't transparent either. He is wearing a leather aviator jacket, glasses, and a wool cap with the ear flaps pulled down. He is old. Being only eleven years old, I bolt down the stairs and don't mention anything, nor do I explain why I am going to sleep at 8:00 PM when my four year old cousin was told to go to bed (she shared my room during her visit).

Flash-forward to sometime over Christmas break that same year: I am looking at old family photos with my brother, and I come across a photo of the same man I saw a week earlier in my room! I ask my Mom who he is, she tells me he is my Great Grandfather. I ask where he lives, she tells me that he passed away a few days after I was born.

I don't know why he popped in, and now I feel a bit bad for running away from him (hey, I was eleven years old!). But it makes sense now: all the family is together in ""the old house,"" he had been there when he was alive. I suppose he was just checking in on me! He was the first ghost I saw, but not the last.

I Saw a Ghost (Again),"New York, United States",Family / Friends Visits,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Family / Friends Visits :: I Saw a Ghost (Again)

A bit of detail before I go into the story: I have a large family. I was fortunate to be close to all my cousins from childhood through present day. My cousin's mom was a big fan of Easter, she was always making Easter baskets for her kids, even when they were grown. I am the youngest of two siblings, so I always related the best to other ""youngest"" cousins. My favorite cousin I will call ""J..."" Some say he committed suicide, others suspect foul play. Either way, I miss him very much - and it's almost been ten years since he's been gone.

A bit more detail: the night he went missing, I dreamt that we were playing hide and seek in this huge orchard of apple trees. We were kids in the dream, and as I chased after him, we aged. I tripped over a tree root, looked up... And woke up crying and screaming. This isn't the first dream I've had like this (prophetic) so needless to say I was worried. Come to find out later in the day he was found dead; hanging from a tree.

So now the ghost story: it was Easter time, I was thinking of J because of the whole Easter-thing. I went to sleep crying. My sleep was interrupted: I was being physically shaken in a ""Get up, get up!"" kind of way. I saw a dark figure hovering over me, silent. It was mostly a head and shoulders, but I didn't look for anything more. Panicking, I threw a stuffed animal at it and covered my eyes like a little kid. I hoped for ANY sound from my parents downstairs, and finally heard my Dad making his coffee. I bolted down the stairs so fast and so scared! I told my Dad: ""There's someone in the house! He's in my room!"" He almost called the Police, it was that real to the both of us. He thought someone had broken into our home.

Later that day, my brother mentioned a story about J. It was this stupid thing that kids do: stick their heads in stuff. Well J had stuck his head in my Grandmother's cat's wicker basket, and his head got stuck. I remember my Grandmother pulling the basket off his head; he was standing in front of the window where the sun was shining in. I didn't so much see his face, but his silhouette. And then it hit me: the shape of his head. The figure hovering over me. I had seen J, and didn't even know it until someone brought him up.

Scariest Night of my Life,"California, United States",Poltergeists / Physical Manifestations,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Poltergeists / Physical Manifestations :: Scariest Night of my Life

I t was October 12, 2007 around 9:30 pm and I was on the computer. I was alone in the house (except for the cats) and was getting ready to watch a movie when all of the sudden one of my cats started hissing and scratching violently at the corner of the room that was completely empty. His hair was straight up and his ears were folded over.

After a couple minutes of me standing there staring blankly at him it started to get really cold and the hair on the back of my neck and arms started to stand up. I could literally see my breath. I went to turn the thermostat up and every thing went silent, even my cat. It was getting pretty creepy sitting there in complete silence, until I started hearing these scratching noises. For a second I thought it was my cat again but he was sitting calmly right next to me.

I started to get the chills again and all of the sudden, like out of nowhere I see my tape dispenser fly off my desk and slam into the wall. It hit so hard that it made a very loud thud and left a hole in the wall. I mean what do you do when this kind of stuff happens? Do you just try to leave the house or do you wait for something else to happen? Seriously? I was totally freaked out and that's when my cat started up again, hissing and growling at the corner.

I didn't know what to do so I just went to (more like ran faster than I ever have) to my Aunt's house down the street and stayed there for the night. It's like whenever I tell this story I get the chills and scare myself.

Who Turned the Lights Out?,"California, United States",Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: Who Turned the Lights Out?

I t's 10:40pm, on Monday, October 15. My wife and I have just tended to our daughter who turns three years old in exactly one week. We'd put our daughter down to sleep around 9pm and were watching television when we heard her start crying. Running to her room I opened the door and was met with darkness. I flicked the switch inside the doorway but the light did not go on so I crossed the room to where the lamp stood and flicked the switch there, but still the lamp did not go on. I leaned over, found the night-light in the outlet and turned it on. By its light I could see the plug to the lamp laying on the floor; it had been pulled out of the wall. I plugged the lamp back in and once again the room was filled with light... Just like we'd left it an hour and a half ago.

Our daughter doesn't like to sleep in the dark so not only does she have her night-light, but we've been leaving her lamp on until we go to bed, too.

I picked my daughter up and my wife and I calmed her down and got her back into bed, and then she said those words parents the world over have probably heard many times before, but just written off as their baby having a bad dream.

In light of other things that have happened in our house before tonight , I didn't even need to look at my wife to know exactly what she was thinking.

As I tucked my daughter in I said quite loudly, ""Leave the lights alone. You've scared the little girl. She doesn't like the dark. It's not funny so leave the lights alone...""

My daughter looked up at me and I smiled and winked at her, and she smiled back at me. We kissed her goodnight and as we left her room and closed the door I smiled back at her and said once more, ""Leave the lights alone...""

Hiding books and small items for days at a time is harmless. Scaring my daughter by turning off the lights is a prank of a different nature, so I hope our co-inhabitants got my message that we didn't appreciate it. I don't know whether they were trying to be helpful by turning out her lights like we would do before we go to bed, or if they were just playing a joke, but we didn't find it very funny and neither did our daughter.

My First Ghost,United Kingdom,Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: My First Ghost

T he first time I ever saw a ghost, I had no idea it had happened because they were so ""real"". When I was 18 years old, my husband (then my boyfriend) used to deliver milk for a living. Before he got his own round, he used to cover other staff while they were on holiday. On a Saturday, I sometimes used to go out and help him.

One Saturday at 8.a.m. in August 1990, we were out on a normal milk round on a council estate. The road was mostly full of houses, but there were a few blocks of flats which were around three stories high. He sent me into one block with a few pints of milk to deliver the top floor while he went into the one next-door. I walked through the front door (which was heavy metal/glass and spring loaded to close by itself) and climbed the stairs. As I reached the third step, a little girl of around 6 or 7 years old with red hair, wearing a jade green sun-dress and bright green plastic shoes walked down and round the corner towards me. She looked at me and I went to say ""Hello!"" but for some reason I didn't do it.

Another strange thing that occurred to me afterwards is that there seemed to be quite a large space between us, even though the stair well was pretty narrow. As I got near to the top of the stairs, she looked up at me. As I put the milk bottles outside the flat, it suddenly occurred to me that 8 a.m. was a bit early for a small child to be wandering around on her own and also that I hadn't heard the front door of the building shut or any of the doors to the flats downstairs opened or closed. I hadn't heard any voices and no one came down to look for the child, which most parents would certainly have done.

I literally ran down those stairs looking for her. The little girl was not inside the building and she was not outside either because I looked up and down the road for her. I ran over to my husband, who had just got back to the milk float (delivery vehicle), in a bit of a panic and asked if he'd seen a little girl. He looked a bit surprised and then asked whether she had red hair and a green dress. Obviously, I agreed. What really freaked me out was when he asked if she'd come down the stairs when I got to the third step, if she'd looked at me, then looked up at me again when I got to the top and then disappeared round the corner. There was no way he could have known that, because he was inside the building next door at the time.

At the time, if several milk-men were on holiday, their rounds would be covered by rotor-men who would go out late at night to drop off the milk quickly. My husband then informed me that the girl had been seen at 1 am, 3 am and 6 am in the morning by different rotor men and had also been seen in the early hours by the regular milk man. Someone had got concerned about the child being allowed out so early and mentioned it to one of the residents, who replied that the child no longer lived there.

The story was that the little girl had been playing outside with her brother and had been accidentally killed by a milk-float (delivery vehicle). Since then, the little girl had regularly been seen or heard by milk men. It turned out that my husband sent me into the building knowing this, but had thought it might not affect me. Thank you very much! Apparently, he mentioned what had happened to the regular milk-man when he arrived back from holiday and the man turned a little pale.

I have never researched whether the story of the child's accident is true. However, I can honestly say that I know children do not disappear into thin air just like that! Needless to say, I stopped helping my husband deliver milk on a Saturday shortly afterwards!

A Lesson Learned,"California, United States",Misc,"T he story I'm about to tell you was told to me by my grandfather. I can't recall the whole conversation we had that day but I think I had made a comment to my grandpa that there was no hell. Let me tell you, after what he told me, I do believe in the devil and in hell.

He told me that back in Mexico where he and his parents had lived, they had a neighbor. The neighbors were an older couple and their 30 something year old son. I can't remember the son's name so let's just call him David. David was a big time alcoholic. Everyday he would drink until he was almost passed out. The neighbors would always see him walking the streets drunk and screaming ""Devil, show me your face"" I'm guessing he didn't believe in him either and was just taunting the devil. Over and over after getting drunk, he would always scream ""Devil, show yourself"".

Well one day, my great grandmother heard a knock on her door. She opened it and it was David's mother. She had asked my great grandma if she had seen David, And that he has been missing for hours. My great grandma said she hasn't seen him all day. After long hours of searching for David, they finally found him.

They found him in this field full of cacti. He was stuck on top of the tallest one! I'm guessing the thorns were keeping him up. Once they took him down (don't ask me how!) David was so scared and told everyone that while he was walking the streets, drinking of course, this man who he said to have looked human raised his arm towards the sky. And as the man did that, that's when David flew up to the top of the cacti.

David said he didn't know who the man was, but somehow believed him to be the devil. I'm guessing because he would always scream for the devil to show himself. After that day he stopped drinking altogether and let's just say he doesn't ask the devil to show himself anymore.

So now I'm wondering if it was something good or bad? Maybe the devil or maybe something good? Maybe it was the devil teaching him a lesson and that he does exist or maybe something good, so that David could stop drinking. Someone help me out.

Uncle Harry,United Kingdom,Family / Friends Visits,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Family / Friends Visits :: Uncle Harry

I must have always been psychic because I can remember seeing ""shadow"" people on the wall of my bedroom when I was little. I used to sleep with my head under the covers to hide from them and I still do so over 30 years later. The psychic stuff stopped for a long time, because I guess my fear must have repressed it. However it re-emerged again after I met my husband, whose family (or at least his mum) considers it as something ""normal"" and nothing to worry about.

This particular experience happened when I was about 20 and still lived at home with my parents. My bedroom was built into the loft of the house and there was a tiny ""corridor"" between my bedroom door and the loft door, which tended to be a bit dark.

One night I was sitting on my bed reading when something made me look up. The door to my bedroom was shut. There in the dark corner by the loft stood my parents' next door neighbour, who we called Uncle Harry. He looked straight at me and was completely transparent. The experience wasn't threatening, but the problem was that he'd died when I was about 14! Needless to say, I ran out of that room pretty quickly! He never appeared again, but after that whenever I sat in my room on my own I would leave the hallway light on and the door open!

The Possessed Relative,"California, United States",Demons / Possessions / Exorcisms,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Demons / Possessions / Exorcisms :: The Possessed Relative

I am Hmong, and my religion is still very traditional. My grandpa was one of the gifted ones that god send to help people on earth. Hmong relatives from all over the world will come and dwell in our house just for him to see this possessed woman. This woman is very ill and sick when anyone is around her, but when no one is around, she will eventually turn into a demon and start chewing on sofas and clothes and will start stripping off her clothes, and speak in a demonize language. But when someone enters the room, she will fall back down, and will eventually faint like nothing had happened.

According to my culture, Hmong people believed that this comes from hereditary. Some Hmongs refer this to as, ""tsev neeg tsis huv..."" This means that some peoples' hereditary are not clean; their family was once possessed by demons, and when they die, they will come back and possess their own children, or grandchildren. This woman, was believed to be possessed by her own mother, who died ten years ago from exorcist.

Her husband and her came to our house, asked my grandpa to help her get rid of the devil. She screamed and yelled and chew on everything that is on her way. It took a while for her to recover, but definitely faster than most religion. She screamed and screamed and desperately calling out for her mother, and for devils to take her back.

After she recovered, she did not recall this, of what had happened to her. She does not remember a bit about what she is about to turn into, but she only remembered being unconscious.

One question I don't get it is that why would demons be interested in us human for? And does religion also matter?

Eerie Ouija,Canada,Ouija Board / Seances,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Ouija Board / Seances :: Eerie Ouija

G ood Day all, I will start off by saying, I am a fairly skeptical person, although I believe the stories of others though, I have had very few things happen in my own life to truly make me a believer.

That having been said, I have a story that is probably worth telling... About 12 years or so ago my great Aunt and her daughter were traveling to our City for a town street sale (I am from a small town and every year they have a sale in May and everyone participates in the selling of odds and ends - a huge garage sale basically) They had packed up various items (some having been left by the previous owners of their newly purchased home) and began to make the hour and a half or so drive.

They had some bizarre things happen at the new home, and attributed it to an Ouija board that they had found when they moved in. Coincidentally, someone did take their own life in the home prior to their moving in, however I am not sure if that is the owner of the board. Regardless, they didn't want it in the house, and it was one of the items they packed to sell in the sale. They had a few bad things happen while en route to our city and joked that it was because of the board and kept on going, something happened to their engine (it couldn't have been too serious because they stopped at a shop and were able to continue on their way) they swore it was the board and threw it out the window... However once they reached my Grandparent's home and began to unpack the car they found the board that they had tossed on the way!

It didn't sell at the sale, and I believe remains in a closet. I can't say for sure if they just had some bad luck or if it really was due to the board... But it is a fun story to tell... I hadn't thought of it in years until happening upon this site. Thanks for letting me share :)

Horrible Little Man,"New Mexico, United States",Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: Horrible Little Man

W hen I was 10 years old, my family had moved to new Mexico and bought a big two story house, we lived in it for about a year. The first few weeks in that house seemed normal, but about a month of living there, me and my brother were sitting in my room playing video games when out of nowhere, we heard someone fall down the stairs. We went out of the room to look and no one was there, so we went downstairs to talk to my mom, only to realize that there was a note on the kitchen counter saying ""Joey had to go pick up your father at the airport be back soon"".

Me and my brother really didn't think much of the occurrence that had happened that night. Two days later the family was sitting around the dinner table eating dinner, when they heard laughter of children, then the power just shut down completely. My father and mother had thought it was just a blown fuse or something of the sort, grabbed two flashlights and went to the fuse box in our basement.

About a minute after the went to the basement, my brother, who by the way was seven, had gotten scared, so me and him went to the kitchen pantry where we had stored a few extra flashlight just in case we ever needed them. When we got the flashlight turned on we saw a horrible looking little man standing there with little red beady eyes, I had gotten scared and tried to hit it away with the flashlight but when I took a good swing at it it just laughed a horrible laugh. We ran as fast as we could into the kitchen about two minutes after the lights came on.

For weeks we would see the horrible little man, after a while we really didn't think of him as much of a threat, but about a couple months living in the house, we decided to move because my father had found a better job. One day, while I was loading boxes of my kid stuff down stairs, I felt something smack me hard on my back, I fell but caught myself when I went downstairs to tell my mom what had happened. She told me to lift up the back of me shirt, when I did, she seen a hand print on my back.

After that occurrence nothing else happened, it took us about two days to move out.

Dark Apparitions and Electrical Devices Acting Up,"California, United States",Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: Dark Apparitions and Electrical Devices Acting Up

I 'm writing about these experiences because I hope someone can tell me whether it is an actual haunting, or possibly, if there are rational explanations for what has been happening. My sister Janeen, brother-in-law Ray, boyfriend Richard, and I all share a house and have lived there for several years. It was built in 1979 so it doesn't have much of a history, and we haven't experienced anything weird until the last few weeks.

None of us are really the superstitious type, but a few things that have happened recently are difficult for me to explain away. The only thing that has changed among us is that I've recently quit taking Celexa, which is an anti-depressant that has unusual withdrawal symptoms. I feel ""power surges"" throughout my brain and body continually, and at first I thought maybe the electrical storm going on in my brain could have caused some of the weirdness going on here. Now I'm not so sure.

The first ghost-type incident happened a couple of weeks ago. Richard, Ray, and I were all in the back of the house. Ray had just finished vacuuming and he and Richard were talking to each other from across the hallway. Rich and I both saw Ray walk down the hallway toward the living room, and our dog Bella was right by his side. A few seconds after he left, the vacuum turned itself on! Janeen was not in the house at the time. Ray went back into the room and turned it off, we all forgot about it and went about our business.

Three night later, however, Rich and I woke up to our dog bristling her back hair and growling. We looked out the window and couldn't see anything, so Rich petted her until she calmed down and we both fell back asleep. It was around 3 in the morning, so I was kind of annoyed by being woken up in the first place. A half hour or so later I was woken up again, and our Nintendo Wii was turned on. The blue disc light was pulsating slowly and that must have been what had awakened me. We hadn't used the Wii in at least a couple of weeks, and the remotes were on a shelf well out of reach of the dog. They are also kept to the side of the TV unit so it would be difficult for the remotes to turn the Wii on. I turned it off and laid back down but did not fall asleep. A few minutes later I could see the blue light pulsing through my eyelids! I turned it off again and watched it for several minutes before I passed out, it didn't turn itself on again (at least while I was still awake).

I guess I saved the creepiest for last. Ray is the only one who has experienced these, but I haven't known him to lie or make up stories. He and my sister are in the master bedroom and their bathroom is directly in front of their bed. On the night that the Wii kept turning itself on, he was walking from his bed to the bathroom, using the light on his Sonicare to guide him there. About halfway to the bathroom a dark form stepped in between the Sonicare and him, completely blacking the light out for a second or two. He kept walking, not really thinking anything of it, and noted when he returned to bed that the light was fully visible and remained solid. It wasn't until I mentioned the Wii that he remembered the dark form in his room. They also keep their door shut so the dog could not have been in the room that night, especially since she was busy in our room waking us up.

Then, two nights ago, the dark form visited him again. What makes it really creepy to me is that everyone in the house was accounted for at the time it happened. He periodically gets up at night and will sleep on the sofa in the living room. That night Rich and I had stayed up late and were talking in our room. We heard Ray come out of the room and were wondering who it was. Then we heard clanks in the kitchen and heard the microwave door shut, so I said ""It must be Ray"" and we continued talking. We were up for quite a while after that and neither of us got up.

The next evening as we all returned home, Ray was talking about being up late the night before, and I told him we'd heard him get up. He said, ""I must have been loud, I saw you come out and check on me..."" I had no idea what he was talking about and told him I didn't check on him, and he proceeded to tell us that when he turned off the light and laid down, he saw someone about my size come from the hallway, stop and look at him, then go back down the hallway! I'm pretty positive Rich and I were still awake by the time he had laid down, so I really don't think I was sleepwalking. Also, my sister Janeen has cerebral palsy and her hips make a loud snapping noise as she walks- it would be impossible for her to be walking and not make the noise.

I try to think rationally about things like this, but I'm starting to get scared that we have a poltergeist or something malicious in the house. Hopefully this is the last incident we'll have. But if anyone could confirm or deny that this is a haunting I would really appreciate it!

Her Money Keeps Disappearing,Iceland,Poltergeists / Physical Manifestations,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Poltergeists / Physical Manifestations :: Her Money Keeps Disappearing

H i, I have always been interested in the occult, ghosts, voodoo, etc. These things have always fascinated me. I have never had such physical encounters as the ones I have been reading. I have been searching the net for information on such topics for quite sometime.

For the past few years something strange has been happening at my home. It may be strange but it is true. My mom lost some money a few years ago. It was a small sum. We never thought much about, thinking she may have spent it and forgotten it. However the money kept continuously missing. My family consists of 5 people... My mom, dad, younger brother, grandma and myself. Initially my mom thought that maybe we kids were taking it. She did not want to believe that, so she started locking her purse in the cupboard and she would keep the keys with her all the time.

But the missing money still continued. Now it has come to such a state that she keeps some money and she is scared to count it again fearing it maybe short. Someone suggested she change the position of the cupboard... She did that. It did not help. People gave her loads of suggestions like keep it in a round container or keep a god's picture with the money or change the locker. She did all. She first got herself a new locker and then a new cupboard. It still continues.

A family friend suggested we meet a spiritual person who maybe able to help. None of us believe in such things but she still went. The guy told her that there is a spirit who is troubling us this way. We obviously did not believe the crap. She consulted another lady. This part is interesting... The lady never asked her what the problem was. She gave her the solution. My mother was shocked.

What we were told is that the place where my home is built is a place where, in ancient times, a temple was built. It is a custom in India that some treasure (these days it's money) is buried beneath the God's idol. The treasure that was supposed to be there was supposedly taken away by someone. Later when the house was built, the spirits responsible for guarding the treasure stayed back. Now she says that the spirits feel responsible for losing the treasure, so they are trying to get it back. But she wonders why it is her? None of us loose the money except her. She does not have an answer for this but this seems to be the only explanation.

Don't Look at the Mirror at Night,Bangladesh,Poltergeists / Physical Manifestations,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Poltergeists / Physical Manifestations :: Don't Look at the Mirror at Night

H i it's me again! I want to start off from when I moved in my new house. Everything seemed normal at first but after a weeks have passed, we came across some weird stuff. Like once when my cat Bilu (real name Babushka but everyone calls her that) came in the house all wet. She just appeared out of nowhere I looked out and saw it was raining. I asked who let her in but my family said they thought it was me. I then thought she probably came through the windows. I checked the house but they were closed because everyone was feeling cold. So I'm like thinking ""hey this is a bit strange"". I mean how did that cat get in.

Another thing was that every time I go to my sister's room, all her cupboards are open. When I close them and turn away, they open again. I felt really scared, so told my dad if he can he sleep in my room and I sleep on mum's bed with her. He said ok.

That night I couldn't sleep, I heard my cat crying in the rain, I was about to get up to get her in when she stopped. I shrugged and started to fall asleep when I heard the cupboards opening. I went and closed them, mum was complaining so I went back to bed. I just put the covers over me when I heard them open again.

""Ambia gumas na khene?"" my mum said which meant ""Ambia why don't you go to sleep"". I looked up and saw a man looking at me from the mirror. Since then I haven't been in my mum's room.

A Few Unexplainable Experiences,"Pennsylvania, United States",Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: A Few Unexplainable Experiences

W hen I was 12 years old, my mom, brother, sister and I moved into an older house in Shillington, PA. I have always been very in touch with my feelings, when it comes to paranormal type things, and from the very first time I even saw the house up until the first year we lived there, I always had an ""odd"" feeling, but never actually experienced anything.

My sister and I shared the attic and would often stay up talking to all hours of the night. One night in the middle of our conversation, we heard someone walking up the attic steps, so we stopped talking and pretended to sleep, because we were already suppose to be sleeping. While laying there I realized that no one actually walked up the steps and I got up to check it out, but it was nothing. We shrugged it off and continued talking until we heard the footsteps again, we stopped talking and looked at each other and waited. Suddenly, it sounded as though something was running up and down our steps. My sister jumped into bed with me and we just laid there listening to it, silently until we fell asleep. This happened several more times, but only to me, my sister never heard it again!

Another odd thing that happened in our room was that, both out beds used to shake. It wasn't an extremely violent shake and you couldn't actually see it shaking, but you could feel it. In fact, a few of our friends have felt it while sleeping over, and none of us could figure it out.

I have had other things happen just to me, like while putting my makeup on in the morning before school, several times it felt as though someone rushed up behind me and each time it scared me enough to make me jump and drop my makeup. And speaking of makeup, it was always being moved around, or it would go missing... And no it was not my sister! I have also seen things out of the corner of my eye and I swear in the middle of the night, someone pulled the covers off me. I also once woke up to the sound of a bag rustling around in the middle of my room and when I quit flicked on the light, it stopped.

The only thing I can think of that didn't take place in my room is one night I was sitting in the dining room on the computer and I heard the sound of something moving in the kitchen. We had just gotten a kitten so I didn't think anything of it. Later I went to get a drink and I noticed that our space heater was moved from the far end of the kitchen all the way to the entrance of the kitchen, and there is no way that an 8 week old kitten did that.

These are the things that stick out in my mind from that house. Of course at the time I would feel a little uneasy and occasionally frightened, but I never felt threatened. From all the things that went on, it almost seems as though it was children. I eventually moved out when I was 17, and until the day I moved out I always felt something in that house. I am now 20 and I have only really experienced two or three things since. My family no longer lives in that house and I have tried talking to my mom about my experiences, but she doesn't believe in the paranormal and laughed it off telling me that I was young and it was my imagination.

So for the most part, why was it only me experiencing all of this and has anyone had similar experiences?

The Spirit of my Brother's Apartment,"Utah, United States",Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: The Spirit of my Brother's Apartment

L ast summer, I had an experience that I'll never forget. I was about to go to sleep in my brother's spare bedroom. I shut off my light, and laid in bed. My brother had gone to bed too, and his door was shut, and it was very noisy when opened, so I knew that this wasn't him.

I suddenly heard footsteps pacing up and down the hall outside the bedroom. I froze, trying to tell myself to stay calm. Then, much to my dismay, the footsteps ended up in the bedroom, right next to the bed I was sleeping in. Then, something bent down, touched my shoulder, then whispered in my ear. It was a man's voice that said ""Everything is okay..."" This was not my imagination. I felt his breath in my ear, and I felt his presence come into the room, then leave. After that, I had a creeped out feeling, and didn't fall asleep until like 3 hours after the experience.

The rest of the summer, I kept quiet, for fear that I would scare my brother. It wasn't until about a week ago until I finally told him. He said that he had experiences to, and he asked his landlady if anyone died in the apartment. She then told him that her father had died in the room that I was sleeping in. I do believe it was her father's spirit that was just making sure all was well in the apartment. After that experience, my whole perspective on the supernatural has changed. Now I know that ghosts can't hurt us, unless we let them.

Dangerous Spirit?,"North Carolina, United States",A Haunted Life,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: A Haunted Life :: Dangerous Spirit?

F irst, if you're reading this, you probably should read my other two posts , as this is a continuation, of how things have gone from bad to worse. Before, I was only bothered in my dreams, in my head, in the things that I alone could see or feel. I had never been physically hurt, or bothered. But, a few weeks ago, things changed.

I was spending the night with a friend, so I had to share a bed with her. That's a girl thing I guess, because guys would just sleep on the floor, but I consider this girl the sister I never had. So I'm in the bed, preparing for what I thought was yet another sleepless night, (I've come to love and dread my insomnia in equal proportion, because it keeps away the nightmares) when I fell asleep. Normally, I don't have the dreams of my spirit(or whatever he may be, but that's what I will call him, as spirit sounds better than thing) or of anything else connected to the abnormal, ghosts, etc. when I'm at her house. But, that night I did, and it was an awful sort of dream, the sort you can't remember when you wake up, save for bits and pieces, all you get is that horrible fear, and paranoia.

But, in this dream, something grabbed me. And, at the exact time, my friend grabbed me in my sleep. That would not be so weird, maybe even sort of funny in a way, but she has never once in all the years I've known her, and there's been a lot, ever been the sort of sleeper to do that. She mostly snores, and doesn't bother the person next to her, unless they bother her, which usually means her kicking me back after I kicked her for the 100th time that night.

So, I scream, and jump up, out of the bed running to the door, because I know something is there, and it wants to kill me. Later, the rational part of my mind tells me I ran because I thought that it already got my friend, and was going to get me too. But, that was what I wanted myself to believe, not what I really thought, because what I really thought, was the thing from my dream, it was there, it was in her, and it was going to use her to hurt me.

I wasn't coherent enough to think the word possession then, but later that's what I came to. I know, that in spite of the myths, actual possession is pretty rare, so they may not have been the case, and I hope to God it isn't, because that would mean I somehow put one of my friends in danger.

Thinking that what meant to harm me was in her, I ran. I wasn't running from it, I was running from her, because even if something bad was using her to hurt me, it was still her, and I would never hurt her, even to defend myself. She's been my best friend since we were little kids, and I couldn't bring myself to that.

So, I ran, still screaming apparently, because my friend's sister ran to the door. Now, whether this was sleepwalking or not, I'm not sure, because I can remember screaming, jumping up, and starting to run, but this conversation I can't, and I have been known to talk in my sleep. And I have slept walked before in the past, only once, but it could happen again.

According to her, I told her 'there's something there' I said it a few times, and I was really freaked out, really afraid. She told me it was my friend, and that when she did, I gave her this weird look, like I was confused, and didn't know what she was talking about.

After that, I crawled back in, and my friend asked me what was going on. She was lying down, but when I jumped off the bed, she had been sitting up. That seemed weird to me, but I was so embarrassed I had one of my screaming dreams there, I didn't mention it. No one really knows about these things, as I don't want them dragging me off to seek mental help, for my own good, as I can hear them saying.

I blew it off, decided it was just one of those things happen. Then, a few days ago, I woke up, in the middle of the night, and heard something moving around in my room. It felt like it was in my closet, or my bathroom. Sort of like a mouse moving around, but ten times louder. And a sort of rattling, clicking sound. I wanted to get up, to go see, but this voice in my head told me not to, saying ""if you open the door, whatever it is will kill you..."" so, I was going to listen, but I was tired, so tired of being afraid to even sleep at night, so I was going to get up, that voice in my head (the voice of common sense, most likely) arguing with me all the while. Then, in the end, I decided not to, fear not stopping me, but modesty, as I was only wearing one of my dad's old tee shirts, and it didn't cover much skin.

Still I sat there, trying not to breathe to loud, praying harder than I ever prayed, for God to please, please, whatever it was, to not let it hurt me. Which says a lot, since I haven't been praying that much lately, or even been the best Christian I could be. I guess life has me questioning my faith occasionally, and I wanted to take some time to figure that out in my head. Not that I don't believe, I do. God is love. Everything else can kind of of slip away from time to time I think, as long as you believe that God is all that is good. But this isn't about religion, although, in some cases, the things on this site and it can be tied together.

I haven't slept since then. Not more than about thirty minutes at a time. Which, isn't all that bad, because I don't want to wake up to that again.

What scares me, is what if I was right, and my friend was possessed? That would mean I brought this on innocent people. I knew there was something bad at there, my spirit warned me of something once, though I can hardly remember. I know it would never be my spirit, he is more likely to play the role of guardian, or protector. He would never hurt me. I care for him, if I'm honest, even love him, in a strange sort of way.

The thing is, I'm pretty sure whatever this bad thing is, I could bring it to me. I've heard of people who are very in tune with each other, having the same dream. And, if its possible I can talk to spirits in my head, then I'm sure me and my best friend having the same dream is possible. And, what if, somehow, I let it get her? If she was in fact possessed, which I do not like to believe.

I think maybe I could somehow accidentally call it to me. Once, it was around a year or a year and a half ago, I was able to call my spirit. Or, maybe that's not the best way to describe it, and I haven't ever really discussed it in detail before, because it really does make me sound loopy.

What happened was I was convincing myself he was not real, that he was some silly, illogical childhood fantasy that I had created, and was crazy enough to believe. But, I couldn't let him go without saying goodbye, so I tried to find him, to get him to me. But I couldn't, so I brought myself to him. I was lying in bed, not asleep, but eyes closed, concentrating. Then, after a while, I was in the place where we always were, in the dark, and he was there.

I could still feel my body in the bed, every nerve felt alive, could feel the bed under me, but I felt everything that happened there too. I cried there, and I could feel it in my bed, though I wasn't crying in there. I hugged him, spoke to him, and I felt it, in both places. I don't know what to call it, but it was like I was actually there, and still at home in bed at the same time. It could be an out of body experience, but I don't think it was. I only know that I was there, that I had made us meet, and I didn't know how.

I could never make it happen again. Which was fine, as it gave me the worlds worst headache trying. But, what if I did it and found the bad thing?

The other day, I was walking, and out of nowhere, I had a scratch on my arm. Not deep, sort the scratch you would get if someone caught your arm to get your attention, and their nails scraped you by mistake. But it was there, out of thin air. I told my family, and they told me I must have ran into something and not noticed until then. I am clumsy, so that could be true, only it isn't, I know it. I feel it.

When I sleep, I wake up, my whole body hurting, my head splitting. When I dream, I wake up, terrified, but not remembering. The only dream I remember is me, lost in a forest, its snowing, I come to a clearing, fall, give up, the my spirit is there, and holding down a hand to help. I take the hand, then I wake up. That is okay, because I'm happy to have my spirit back, but I wonder why he is back, and think it may be because the other things. He may really want to help me.

What's worse, is I think this other thing, the bad one, may want to hurt my spirit. And I can't let that happen. I love him, as if I really knew him. Maybe I did, in a past life or something. But, in my dream, when he puts down his hand to help me up, it's like I've found something I've been searching for my whole life. That sounds like something in some corny romantic comedy, but it isn't like that. It's like feeling whole. I know I'm becoming to attached to him, I go months without seeing him, then when I do, in spite of why, I'm happy.

I want him to find peace. I think he wants me to help. But this other thing, I think its in his way. I'm not sure, me and my spirit don't talk much these days, its always the same darn forest, and the same darn ending.

But, if I can hear this thing physically, if it can touch me, and it can possibly possess someone I know, then I think I'm in over my head. I don't want it to hurt me, and more importantly, I don't want it to hurt someone I love, my friends, my family.

I don't know what to do. I don't know how to make it go away. So, if anyone knows how to handle it, please tell me. Thanks for reading.

My Son Sees a Ghost,"Illinois, United States",Children Who See Spirits,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Children Who See Spirits :: My Son Sees a Ghost

J une. It's like 3 in the morning. It's ink dark in the house. I'm knocked out of a deep sleep by a scream.

This isn't the normal screaming I'm used to. This isn't ""oh dear, I've stabbed myself with this kitchen implement!,"" Nor was it ""Good Lord, that fecal expurgation was distressingly large and I fear that I may have torn something loose down there!"" It was real fear. It was ""I just saw a freaking ghost...""

I ran downstairs, my mind blank with concern, and found Connor standing in the dining room, all the lights on, wailing. I grabbed him, asking what was wrong, checking him for blood, automatically adding up his extremities. He was perfectly fine--and white as a sheet. I asked him what happened.

Now my kids hate my inflexible stance on the paranormal, a stance immovable and fixed: it's one rung below noodling and NASCAR on the rung to true redneck Gothic stupidity and I don't buy it. I don't believe in:

It just doesn't happen. As much as I enjoy reading about it, and as thrilling as it may seem, I think it's a big bucket of self aggrandizement and delusion and the precipice off which one can gape into the wide, wiggly valley of bonkerville.

That isn't to say I won't tell a good ghost story. I've turned entire ranks of Cub scouts into wild-eyed, wigged-out believers. I made them cry and beg me not to tell another story. I've had parents tell me maybe I ought to tell some jokes instead. I can lay into it.

And I've met men who've spent their lives in the pursuit of dignity and providence, men who are not easily shaken, men who would stare down the barrel of a gun. They were the kind of guys you vote for. Pillars of character. And they told me they'd seen a ghost. Yet I don't buy it. I just don't.

But I'm closer now than I ever have been. If I shield my eyes and squint, I can barely see the idea of ghosts being real--like trying to make out the opposite shore of a long lake. I'm closer not because of Connor's recent scare. I'm closer because of my dog.

Connor didn't want to talk about what happened that night. He came upstairs and slept fitfully between me and my attorney. The next day Connor explained that he'd looked out his bedroom door and seen a face looking around the door jamb, then jerk back out of sight. He said he saw it then he screamed. I told him it was probably just part of a dream that got mixed up with some night time noise and not to worry about it and he bought it. Or seemed to.

But several months later. Yesterday, actually, out of nowhere, he told me what happened. We're driving back from downtown, just the two of us, and he tells me this version.

He says he woke up because Ty (the dog) was whining. He sat up in bed and Ty was standing next to the bed looking out the door, stock still. Connor looked up and saw a person dressed in nice clothes with white hair pulled back. He said they looked into his room and seemed amused. Connor said the dog backed up.

Connor said it took him a long time to scream. He said he had to make it happen. Then he said he screamed for a long time before I got there. (Of course, the sister never woke up.)

I've told you before our dog is gay and I mean that in a good way. Our gay friends know how to nurture--and Ty is no exception. When Connor gets hurt, Ty is all over him, tail wagging like crazy, licking and nudging, as if he's saying ""It's all right, you'll be ok, don't worry, look I'm licking you. Everything is good. Lick lick lick""

But when I raced downstairs to deal with the screaming, when I skidded into the dining room and found Connor too afraid to come upstairs or go back in his room, the thing I forgot until yesterday is this: Ty's tail was dragging the floor and he was standing with his furry butt backed-up to the window and he was not happy. He was as far away from the hallway bathroom and he could get, still as a statue--looking over my shoulder.

Now perhaps Connor enjoyed a delusional moment of heightened and sudden neuroses. Maybe a moth flew into his room. Maybe nothing happened and he just had a dream. But the dog? Ty does nothing but wag his tail, lick people, and run around trying to figure out where we're going to walk next. He never stands still. Ever. Even when he's in STAY he's twitching and sweeping the floor with his tail, and smiling and panting and drooling all over himself. But this time--nothing. Backed up against the wall, afraid of the bathroom.

Strange Figure,"Louisiana, United States",Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: Strange Figure

T here were many times when I have came face to face with a ghost. In my old house I used to always see this ghost looking figure in my hallway. My family used to always bring up ghost stories about the house, but I didn't pay it any attention because I thought that was the past. But one day I was in the living room watching tv when this flash of light ran across the hall.

So I jumped up and went towards the door getting ready to run outside because I thought someone has broken into my house and was trying to do me something, but I never left the house. Than this strange looking thing ran across the hall again. I only could see his bottom and never could see his top, only his legs was visible and the rest of its body was invisible.

I asked my mother what's this strange looking figure that runs across the hall at times? She asked how did it look. Than I explained it to her and than she said that's the same figure that she always use to see at times and that she never discover what is it or why do it appears. I thought I was the only one seeing this kind of ghost, but when I started asking more people in my house have they ever seen such thing before, they all said yes their have and they just wanted to keep it to themselves. So this strange figure been a mystery since this day.

A Friend's Hard Time,"Colorado, United States",Family / Friends Visits,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Family / Friends Visits :: A Friend's Hard Time

M y best friend in the world (Abi*) and I have known each other since birth. I actually went to the hospital and saw her the day after she was born (Of course I don't really remember because I was only eight months old at the time.) She and I are closer than any of my eight other family members to this day.

There was a time in Abi's life that was the most difficult. Her father, the best man in the world!, had cancer in his esophagus. After his surgery, he couldn't eat solid foods for a couple months, but after his throat healed, the doctors thought he was ok. That is until blood started coming out when he used the bathroom. Then they discovered that he had cancer in his liver and several other places in his body.

Abi, of course, took all this very hard. Her parents were constantly on the road, looking for clinics that could try and cure him. Abi ended up staying with me on and off for a couple months. Her main place to stay, though, was her parents friends, Cindi* and Dwight*. They had a bedroom for her and everything.

One night, Abi had this horrible dream. Her dad was lying in a hospital bed. He told her he was dying. She asked if it was the cancer. He said no, I don't have lungs anymore. Of course, Abi woke up bawling and confused.

It was a snow day that day and she called me at 9am and told me about the dream. (She was staying with Cindi and Dwight at the time because her parents were in Minneapolis.) I told her not to worry. Her dad would be home that day and everything would be fine. She told me she didn't think so in the saddest voice she's ever used. I secretly agreed with her.

A couple hours later my mom told me the news. Abi's dad had died. In a shaky, hushed voice I asked if it was cancer that killed him. She said No. It was all the radiation in his body from chemotherapy. It caused his lungs to literally flatten and fail.

Abi called me later that night on her way to Minneapolis. She and I talked for four hours about random stuff. We only talked once about her dad, and then she said she'd rather not think about it. So we just joked with each other, laughing until tears came down our eyes, Abi the same Abi as always even after the loss.

A few days later when she came home, she told me about another dream. Her father was on a giant stage (he loved theater and acted in many many plays around the area) acting as the Cowardly Lion from Wizard of Oz. He looked over at Abi in the middle of his solo, winked, and told her he was fine now. He told her he was sorry about her other dream, but he needed to warn her. He told her he loved her, and she woke up.

Sorry, I know this story is kind of long. But I had to share it. Thanks for your time.

The 3:20 Walker,"Minnesota, United States",Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: The 3:20 Walker

M innesota nights can be breathtakingly cold and are normally so dark you can't see ten feet in front of you. But when the moon is able to sneak out from behind the winter clouds, its reflection glistens off the snow covered ground and lights pathways deep into the forest. I grew up along a beautiful lake in a country setting. It was serene and a wonderful place to make childhood memories. However, the house that we lived in had its eccentricities. One particular, late winter night proved that our family was not been living in the house.

After a couple hours of evening television our family retired to our separate bedrooms; my brother to his at the end of the hallway, my parents and baby sister to the master and me, the first room off the dining room. It had been a long school day and I was exhausted. As normal I left my bedroom door open just a crack so that my small dog could enter if he wanted to, undetected, and snuggle up for the night. I turned down the bed spread and jumped into my bed falling asleep immediately.

Oddly, I awakened in the middle of the night. I was not in a daze as if just coming out of a dream, rather I was alert immediately. I glanced at the clock on the dresser which was glowing 3:20AM in its digital red numbers. The moonlight was filtering through the night. Then I heard a noise in the basement, below my bedroom. It was a familiar noise but strange at the same time. The basement was not carpeted but had a full apartment which used to house the previous owners' son. The apartment was separated from the downstairs' laundry by a large, solid wood pocket door which was always kept open while we lived in the house. The pocket door had been installed many years before on a sturdy metal track which had a distinct rolling sound as the door was opened or closed. This is the noise I heard.

I wasn't immediately alarmed by the noise in the basement, my mom had been known to wake up early to do laundry before I was old enough to help. So I listened for a moment, closing my eyes and wanting to go back to sleep. It wasn't until I heard the foot steps on the wooden stairs leading from the basement to the kitchen that I knew this was not my mom. My heart started to race. I listened more intently to the heavy, methodical steps being taken by the intruder as they came closer to the landing in the kitchen at the top of the stairs.

The foot steps did not stop at the top of the stairs. They continued across the kitchen linoleum in the same rhythm. The sound was eerie and is still vivid in my memory today, 30 years later. They didn't get any louder as they crossed the linoleum, as I expected they should if the intruder was coming toward my room. All of a sudden they stopped. OH MY GOSH, the intruder was on the carpet! I yanked my bedding over my head expecting the worst. Barely breathing from the fear that I was to be discovered, I laid there stiffly so that I wouldn't move. There was nothing. My door didn't swing open. No more footsteps. No voices. It seemed like a lifetime, but I gradually dozed off.

At the breakfast table the next morning I nonchalantly asked my mom if she had been up wandering around the previous night. To my amazement, she screamed and started crying. She asked what time... I told her... through her tears she said she had heard the exact same thing for the past four nights at the exact same time.

To this day we have no idea what (who) it was but we didn't hear it again after that conversation. I also never understood why our dog didn't bark.

Oh, some years later after we had moved out of the house we discovered that the son of the previous owners had hung himself in the basement. (This has been our only clue.)

The House on Cambridge,"Ohio, United States",Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: The House on Cambridge

I am going to be relating to all of you a series of small stories about a house my family used to live in. Out of the seven people who lived there, three experienced overt and direct contact with unseen forces. Another three family members were witness to seemingly supernatural events, but were not touched or spoken to outright. Only one person in the family has not ever experienced anything unusual in the house other than an uneasy feeling of being watched.

I must start with one caveat, though: despite living in a very, very unusual house and having suspicious things occur all around me, I remain very skeptical and hesitant to label these activities the product of ""ghosts,"" so to speak. Until I was jabbed in the back and whistled at by an unseen entity in Holland this autumn, I maintained that I did not believe in ghosts. I try to remain as objective as possible and consider all possibilities. However, I believe there are things out there that we cannot understand and for the sake of clarity, I will employ traditional modes of diction to describe these phenomena. And I guess I now DO believe in ""ghosts""...

Let us start right at the beginning. My mother remarried in 1984 and had three children in addition to the two from her first marriage. I will refer to these people as brothers 1 and 2, and sisters 1 and 2. Sister #1 is my full-blooded sister from the first marriage and the others are all half-siblings as we share the same mother, but have different fathers. (It matters not, we're all brothers and sisters!) The house we lived in was too small for such a large brood. We moved into a large Victorian house on the west side of Columbus, Ohio. It sat on about two acres of what had once been pastoral land, but what was now the suburbs. The house was built in 1898 and had once been the abode of a wealthy family. There was a carriage house out back that included what had been the butler's quarters. The third floor of the house was where the maid once lived. There is an expansive basement with several rooms. There is a grand staircase the goes up to a landing which winds around the second floor giving access to four bedrooms where everyone but me slept. I slept on the top (third) floor because I am the oldest. I am now 30, but was about 13 when we first moved-in in 1991.

We purchased the monolithic house for an amazingly low $200,000. It wasn't like the place was so haunted that the previous tenants needed to move the place fast or anything. It was cheap because it was in desperate need of repair from the inside out. My stepfather is a carpenter and he and my mother were excited to renovate the place. They did a great job of expanding our previous home to accommodate seven people and were looking forward to fixing up this house, as well.

We moved in during the fall of 1991. Things had gotten off to an auspicious start even before we signed the papers. The first time my mother looked at the house during an open house she had an experience. She was in the downstairs bathroom looking out the window into the backyard. There she watched two young girls in dated dresses laughing and playing in the grass. She asked the realtor who's children were in the backyard thinking they might be the neighbors' daughters. The Realtor went to look, but the girls were nowhere to be seen. The neighborhood was full of kids, though, so neither thought much about it. That is, until we actually moved in.

This is the first experience of dozens that led many members of my family to believe our house was haunted. My parents were moving things into the house while the rest of us kids were at school. They were running a ""bucket-brigade"" of objects and appliances from the moving truck into the house. My stepfather was running from the truck to the door, and Mom was shuttling said things all over the house's interior. She was taking pails of paint down into the basement and stacking them in one of the small rooms there when she heard children's footsteps running down the hallway towards her. The foot steps stopped in front of the door and she heard a child's voice say, ""Mama! Mama?"" And she instinctively said, ""Yes, dear?"" thinking it was one of her children. She came out of the room wondering what any one of them was doing home from school since it was the middle of the morning. Brothers #1 and #2 were at elementary school and sister #2 was at daycare. Sister #1 (from the first marriage and my full sister) was at middle school with me. Upon stepping out into the hallway, Mom was surprised to find nobody there. She looked all over the basement and in every room, but discovered no one. Confused, she went upstairs to ask my stepfather if the kids were home. He was perplexed by her story and insisted they were the only two people in the house. They had a lot of work to do, so they brushed it off (somehow...) and continued moving stuff in.

Later that afternoon, as my mother was back in the basement storing odds and ends, she heard music playing from upstairs. My stepfather loves all sorts of music and our house was rarely without it. The music was old and sounded like big band music from the 1920s. My mom went upstairs and found my stepfather bringing things in the house. She asked delightedly, ""Oh, so you already hooked-up the stereo--great!"" My stepfather looked at her quizzically and denied having hooked-up the stereo. In fact, it was one of the few items still at the old house they were going back to retrieve later. Mom insisted she had heard music playing clearly from upstairs while she was in the basement and wanted to know where it had come from. My stepfather said he had never heard any music at all and had been in and out of the house for sometime. He never said this to Mom, but to himself, he was starting to question her sanity a little. At the very least, he was concerned that she had come to him with two explicit and mysterious requests that day that he could not satisfy.

My parents eventually got the house in order and we began to settle in nicely. Everyone loved the place. It was big, bright, welcoming and was the social center for all the neighborhood's kids. If you didn't know where your children were one afternoon, you simply walked over to the Bulls' house and chances were they were playing with one of the five kids in the big yard or about the neighborhood. It wasn't until my little brother #1 complained of being tickled at night that things became decidedly creepy.

Hair Being Pulled,"California, United States",Apparitions / Voices / Touches,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Apparitions / Voices / Touches :: Hair Being Pulled

W hen I was 15 my friend Lisa spent the night with me in the Chula Vista house, Lisa was 14 and was my best friend that I met when I was 9. When we were younger she experienced a lot of the footsteps in the house.

However this night was different, we were listening to music in my room and as I was starting to get tired, I laid down on my twin bed and Lisa was sitting down near my feet. Lisa was just sitting there singing along, we were listening to the song Daddy by Korn. Lisa told me to turn it up, but when I did the cd ejected, I pushed it back in and pressed play. It started playing the first song on the disk, I tried to press skip to go back to Daddy but it wouldn't skip, it stayed on the first song so I just left it alone.

In the middle of the first song it skipped on its own to Daddy. I told Lisa, ""This stupid thing is broken."" When I looked up at her I saw a piece of her hair lift up and her head jerked back a little bit. I thought she was trying to mess with me and scare me, until she got mad and told me to stop pulling her hair. I said, ""I'm way over here, how could I have pulled your hair?"" At that moment we booked it out of the room, leaving the cd playing. We decided not to go back into the room that night and we were actually so creeped out we slept in the travel trailer my dad had parked in the driveway.

Little Boy on the Phone,"California, United States",Misc,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Misc :: Little Boy on the Phone

I was 16 years old and had just gotten my license, at the time I borrowed my Dad's truck because he had to work that day, he also let me borrow his cell phone in case anything happened because the truck was old. His cell phone was for his work; only people at his work and my Grandma had the number.

I was at home in the Chula Vista house with nothing to do, so out of boredom I decided to drive up to Poway to surprise Lisa. I didn't tell anyone that I was going anywhere so no one would have known where I was. So I got to Lisa's and we were trying to decide what we were going to do. We were sitting in her room and of course with her being obsessed with Korn, we were listening to them again like always. I had to go to the bathroom, so she came in and sat on the counter to talk to me, you know all girls go to the bathroom in groups.

I had my Dad's cell phone hooked to my pants and as we were in the middle of a conversation, the phone rang. I answered the phone and it sounded like a little boy, he said, ""Is Lisa there."" I said, ""Who?"" Knowing there was no way anyone knew I was with Lisa or that anyone who knew her would have this number. The little boy said again, ""Is Lisa there."" I said, ""Hold on"" and handed the phone to Lisa. Lisa said, ""Hello"" and then paused and said, ""Yes it is."" Seconds later she turned pale white and started shaking. I asked her, ""What, who is that?"" She was still shaking and she handed me the phone, I grabbed the phone quickly and said, ""Hello"" but no body was there. On cell phones normally a phone number will come up on the ID or it will say unknown but instead all that was there was ""-----------"" across the screen. I asked her what happened and who was on the phone. She said, ""I don't know, but it sounded like a little boy and he asked me 'is this Lisa' so I said 'yes it is' and then he started screaming 'HELP ME HELP ME' and that's when I handed you the phone.""

We had no clue what to make of it and to this day we still don't.

This Wasn't Funny Anymore,"Alaska, United States",Poltergeists / Physical Manifestations,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Poltergeists / Physical Manifestations :: This Wasn't Funny Anymore

M y husband was stationed at Ft. Wainwright, AK with the Army. We lived on base in some of the oldest family housing there. It was built in the 1930's and had been used as barracks before it was family housing. Almost as soon as we moved in, I sensed that we weren't alone in the house.

I started having nightmare which I don't usually have and would wake up in the middle of the night feeling like something was standing over me. My cat would stare at random spots on the walls and ceiling. My dog would bark and growl for no reason. Sometimes I would be alone and feel like I was being watched. I've had experiences with the paranormal before and I never felt threatened but whatever was there. But when it learned a new trick it really started to annoy me.

It started out when a remote disappeared. Of course my husband and I blamed each other and tore the house apart looking for this remote to no avail. We actually had to go to the cable company and buy and new one.

About I month later we were going to bed and as my husband pulled the covers back the remote was in the middle of the bed. I KNOW that the remote wasn't there when I made the bed that morning. We we're just kind of like ""huh"". I just put the remote on the nightstand and went to bed. When little things kept disappearing and turning up in strange spots, we began to think that maybe it was our invisible roommate doing it.

Things really seemed to escalate when my husband left for Iraq. I was alone in the house so I know that if I didn't move stuff then, it must be something else messing with me. When my toothbrush went missing I had had enough. I said loudly to whatever was there that it wasn't funny anymore and I give it back.

The next day I found my toothbrush on a shelf in the mudroom. Things stopped disappearing but I think I must have hurt its feelings because I started getting the feeling of being watched more and more. Also there were times when I actually started to feel uncomfortable in my own house.

One night it got so bad I had a friend come over to stay the night because I just didn't feel right by myself. We hung out for a while and went to bed. I went to my room and almost as soon as I laid down I heard her door slam shut. I jumped up to see what was wrong. I opened the door and she was terrified. She said that she watched the door slowly close and then as it got closer to being shut, it just slammed. Now I feel I should tell you that this is in the dead of winter in Alaska. It's -40 out and there are no windows open and no drafts. We ended up both sleeping on the couch that night and shortly after that I was offered a chance to move houses and I took it.

Figure of a Wolf,"New York, United States",Pets / Animals,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Pets / Animals :: Figure of a Wolf

I 'm finally telling this story. This story is how I believed in ghosts and understand that after you die, you can still be here. I was in 3rd grade, around 9 years old, and it was the summer that mostly all of Long Island, New York, was in a black out. My family slept in the basement. It's a cold basement and in the light, it looks normal, but in the dark, it's totally creepy!

So we had candles light and flashlights on. My battery powered the clock next to my dad. And we all went to bed around 10:00. I kept on waking up. I do that sometimes when I'm not in my own room. About the third time I woke up, I had to go to the bathroom. Quietly got up off the couch and looked at the clock. 3:10 am it said. I walked over and used the bathroom and was walking passed the staircase to the ground floor. I saw something that looked like a wolf. It was a shadow. I looked closely and the I felt something. Like an aura around me. Now I was 9 years old, and I was freaking out! I just stared at the wolf shaped figure and then it vanished and the aura around me went away.

That was the last time I've seen a wolf figure in my house. Oh and another weird thing is that the lights went on after I got back to my little couch where I was sleeping. My house isn't haunted because I moved into it when I was 1 years old and it was built on just normal land. Flat land. No woods. So I don't know why a wolf figure was in my house. Can someone explain to me?

My First Romance Was with a Ghost,"Texas, United States",Psychic / Medium,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Psychic / Medium :: My First Romance Was with a Ghost

T his is my very first ghost experience it happened when I was 12 years old. I was sleeping, or so I think, and I had this dream about this girl and something happened to her, it was really fuzzy. I woke up and I saw my body on the bed. I got a little scared and tried to grab it but nothing happened. I was in a huge panic, I kept walking around, thinking how did this happened. I tried closing my eyes then opening them, but nothing happened.

I was about to go to crazy mode until I saw this girl. She was about 11 or 12, she had blonde hair and blue eyes, her face looked like a angel. She told me not to be scared and that she would put me back into my body. She told me of a evil entity around here that made this happen. Before I went into my body, she said she loved me ever since I moved into the house. And that she tried her best to protect me from the evil entity. And right then, she kissed me on the lips! Her lips were really soft and like people say ghost feel cold, but her lips felt warm. She said she would see me again after I went into my body.

When I woke up, I looked at the door because that's where I last saw her, I couldn't find or see her anywhere. When I went to school, I told my best friend about it, he said it could be possible that it really did happen. To this very day I still hope she would return to me again I would like to see her one last time.

Nicole's Story about our House in Chula Vista,"California, United States",Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: Nicole's Story about our House in Chula Vista

F or this story I'm going to let my friend Nicole write it since it is her account of things she experienced in the Chula Vista house. I've known Nicole since we were in 6th grade together, which was about 15 years ago. So here is her story.

The first time I was ever in Holly's house in Chula Vista was when I was 15 years old, although I had heard the things Holly had told me and since I didn't believe in those sort of things at the time, it didn't bother me to go over there. There were a few times I thought I saw shadows move, or heard footsteps that would give me chills, but I would just say it was an older house and made noise.

For me the part of the house that always seemed to have weird things happen in it was the bathroom... When you walked into the bathroom, there was the toilet directly to the right and the vanity with a mirror on the left wall across from the shower on the right wall and a small window in between the two on the back wall. Almost every time I used the bathroom, I would feel strange inside there and even when the door was locked, it would occasionally open on its own.

The time that freaked me out the most that I remember vividly was in the summer of 1997, I had just turned 16 and had my license and Holly and I were hanging out and were planning on going out that night. Holly was going to make us lunch while I was going to take a bath and shave my legs. We were listening to some music and the boom box was just inside the window on the counter and Holly came over and opened the window so she could hear the music too.

I was relaxing in the tub when all of a sudden the music stopped, I yelled turn it back on because I thought Holly had reached in and turned it off to mess with me. I heard loud footsteps in the back room by the window and thought it was her, so I told her again to turn it back on. When the music didn't come back on, I got up and wrapped the towel around me and looked out the window and no one was there, I turned to walk to the door and it was open, even though I know I locked it. I walked out to the kitchen and there was Holly still making lunch and asking me why I turned off the music and I told her, ""Shut up, you turned it off, that's messed up that was a good song."" Holly then said while laughing it off, ""whatever dude, don't try to freak me out."" I replied, ""Seriously I heard you walking around in the backroom."" ""I was here the whole time I even told you to turn it back on while I was out here,"" said Holly.

We both to this day just swore it had to be one of us who did it so we could sleep easier, but as we have been talking about these occurrences, we now know that neither of us did it.

Ghosts Don't Like New Construction,"New York, United States",Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: Ghosts Don't Like New Construction

J ust over 9 months ago, my fiance at the time, and now my wife, purchased a house in upstate NY. approx 50 miles from NYC. We purchased a cape code house with plans of demolishing the whole second floor and turning the house into a colonial.

The house was on the market for about 6 months before we came to contracts and had our closing. When we first went to see the house I remember my wife, the agent, my mother and father in law walking through on a tour. I remember walking into one of the bedrooms that appeared to be previously occupied by a child because you can see some crayon drawings on the door, which at the time was odd because usually the seller would apply a fresh coat of paint over the walls before putting it on the market. It was apparent everywhere else that a fresh coat was applied before it went on the market. I remember being the last one out of that room, when right before I was exiting the room, I heard someone following me, clearly hearing footsteps behind me, but when I turned to hold the door open, no one was there.

That was something I kept to myself because I thought perhaps I was hearing things or just didn't want to believe that it was a ghost. Well we made the purchase and 3 weeks later the roof is coming off and the whole top floor was removed. We started construction soon after the removal adding 3 bedrooms, 1 full bath and an attic with a regular size staircase up to it. The first floor, we turned our garage into our living room and gutted out the bath and kitchen and redid both. The only 2 rooms in the house that we didn't do anything with besides paint and new windows and central air were the 2 existing bedrooms on the first floor.

For 2 months we did not sleep in the house because of the mess and the dust from the construction etc. My father in law, while the house was under construction, would sleep in the (crayon/bedroom) because he was doing the electrical and would get tired and just sleep there. When I would arrive the next morning from sleeping at my parents house, he would say ""you know, a few times last night I woke up because it felt like someone was holding my nose and covering my mouth"". Then he would say that he would hear footsteps upstairs etc.

Recently my light in the attic is on when I arrive home from work and I leave in the morning after my wife and am the first to arrive home in the evening. I found it on 3 times this week. Yesterday my wife and I were on the couch watching a movie when we heard the water running in the bathtub in the downstairs bath. I went to check and the faucet was off and the tub was dry.

We have a little yorki and sometimes he will jump up for no apparent reason and bark, but what's odd is when he hears someone, he runs to them or to the door etc. Occasionally he'll bark like someone is there, but won't go to it.

I think I should have had the house blessed before we moved in. I think that if in fact there is a child ghost or someone there that he or she isn't bad and aren't going to harm us, because they I would venture to say they would have done so already. I think maybe they thought we were going to demolish the whole entire house which is why they tried to harm my father in law while he was asleep.

I am trying to build up the courage to tell it that he/she is no longer living and needs to go to god, I'm afraid that things will get crazy after that and I don't want to be forced out of this brand new house that we worked so hard for. Sorry this was so lengthy but I wanted to fully explain my situation so that I can be given the proper advice or guided in the right direction.

A Ouija Seance Brought On a Poltergeist,"Washington, United States",Ouija Board / Seances,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Ouija Board / Seances :: A Ouija Seance Brought On a Poltergeist

I t all started a little after I turned twelve. My cousin, sister and I had a fascination with using the Ouija Board. We had been using the board for a short while, and every time we used it, the experience was a positive one.

One night, some family friends came over. I was telling my friend about how I used our Ouija board and how we were communicating with spirits and psychics. She was skeptical about it so I was on a mission to prove what me, my sister and cousin had seen. We went to my bedroom and proceeded to do a seance. We made contact with a spirit on first attempt and it was an angry one. It kept spelling out vulgar remarks and repeating that it was going to kill us.

We were both getting really creeped out so she went and got her cousin, who after a few minutes of panicked rambling, brought him into my room. We still had contact with the same entity as though we'd never stopped using the board. It kept repeating that it was going to kill us, and that we needed to leave the room. So ""Mr. Gangsta"" cousin started to argue with the spirit and antagonize it. He eventually got frustrated with the situation and we all left the room.

That night I remember ranting on about a ghost in my room to my mother, and she reassured me that it was an over active imagination.

A couple of months later we started experiencing poltergeist activity in the house. Doors opening and closing on their own, lights turning on in the middle of the night, particularly the one in the dinning room. This light switch is a turn style knob, so it takes a little more effort to turn it on, rather than just flipping the switch. The kitchen was a hotspot for activity. The cupboards and drawers would open on their own. Cups would fall out of the cabinets and break on the floor on the middle of the night on a frequent basis.

And of course, there is my bedroom. Every night I could hear a deep, heavy breathing, like a man slowly panting next to my bed. It would start quiet, get louder and louder and then stop completely. I would have to sleep buried under all of my blankets and pillows just to get to sleep. I would wake almost every morning with claw like scratches on my body. Objects in the house would be re-positioned, or moved from its original spot to a different room. We never saw this happen, but it was always confusing to walk into a room and think, how the hell did this get here?

We also were seeing shadows. It would walk down the hallway past the bedrooms, and through the kitchen. You'd catch it from the corner of your eye, or feel a cold gust pass by. On many occasions I would be sitting on the couch in the living room doing my homework and I would feel finger tips brush across my hand as I wrote. This would follow with the walls creaking, starting from one end of the house all the way to the opposite side. I used to fear this being entirely. Later as the years went by, I learned that my fear only gave it energy to manifest the disturbances in the household. It seemed particularly angry at me, though other members of the family experienced many of the same things as me.

I am now nearly 23, and have not lived in my parent's house for a couple of years. My mom still reports to me that there is activity in the house, and when I'm there for family gatherings, I feel the negative energy when it is nearby. It's a similar feeling to if you were about to be attacked be a wild animal or something. It seems under control now, but it likes to steal silverware. I have had countless encounters with this entity, but I guess those experiences count for another story. My husband, sister-in-law and I are planning an investigation soon. If anyone has any tips let me know. This is a first time attempt to capture something so any advice is welcome. Also, if we get any results I will be sure to post the findings!

Little White Spots,Canada,Orbs / Lights / Mists,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Orbs / Lights / Mists :: Little White Spots

T oday is October 17, 2007. This morning we all slept in. It was weird because my alarm was set but neither my husband or I heard it go off and it wasn't going off when we woke up. That might not be so odd, I guess it happens.

The weird thing was since we were all up at the same time, we all had to use the bathroom at the same time. Since my husband gives my oldest son a ride to high school and he's supposed to start earlier than my youngest (being in grade school), I really had to let them use the bathroom first so they could get going. Well, I couldn't wait so I ran to the upstairs bathroom. Everybody hates it because it's always cold in there, but this morning I could not wait, I had to go up.

I was up there doing my business on this cloudy October morning when I looked down and saw this little white light moving around by my foot. I thought to myself, just sort of casually, ""that was strange..."" When I looked at it again I saw the same light, like a little spot-light, moving around by my foot in a sort of figure 8 pattern, it was like someone with a shaky hand was moving the light.

This time it caught my attention much more. I watched it for a little bit and wondered where it was coming from. I looked up at the window but it is covered with a heavy drape, no sunlight could get through it at all. Then when I looked at the window, I realized there was no sunshine at all. It was a cloudy, overcast morning.

When I looked back, the light was gone. I couldn't find any type of explanation for it. I have told a lot of different experiences in my ' Uncle Rocky ' stories, some are like this. This was the same type of weird, out of the blue stuff that I have attributed to him. At this point, I have begun to wonder if it has all been him. This is right up his alley though - fooling with the clock (remember neither my husband nor I heard the alarm go off and it seems he's fooled with the clock before).

This was just one of those things that I just can't explain. Thanks for taking the time to read my story, I hope you enjoyed it.

New Office 4 - The Final Chapter?,"Nebraska, United States",Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: New Office 4 - The Final Chapter?

I have submitted a few stories regarding my new office and the occurrences that plagued me since moving in. To say this move has been interesting would be an understatement. Taps on my shoulder, voices, and conversations, being asked by disembodied voices to come home with me, doors opening and slamming, whew. This has certainly kept me on my toes.

About a week ago I had a Minister come to my office after hours and bless my office hoping to rid myself of the entities that were intent on distracting me. This went rather well. No occurrences while he was present and after he left a feeling of peace for me that I had not experienced here since moving in to my new office. Unfortunately, the facilities manager continues to look for employment elsewhere because of all of the occurrences he has had, he refuses to even share most of them with me saying he is still looking for logical reasons.

Well, as I stated, my office itself has calmed down and I have had no experiences in at least the last 10 days. The rest of the building(s) appear to still have something or someone plaguing them. Doors will still open and close and others have reported hearing voices. The security officer finds it fascinating. He likes to watch the doors on the security cameras. He has always checked each and every open and close, assuring that the building is not being broken into. He was not so happy the other day though after becoming locked in the garage for about 3 minutes.

It was very close to the end of the work day and he was making his rounds. He waved to me as he walked by my office. He carries a walkie talkie as well as a cell phone. He had been gone for about a half hour when the staff began noticing he had not returned from his rounds. We tried calling him on his walkie talkie, there was no response, just crackling noises. We tried his cell phone, it went right to voice mail. One of the maintenance workers and I decided to walk his rounds and locate him.

As we neared the garage at the end of what would have been his rounds, we heard knocking from the inside of the garage on the door. I used my master key and unlocked the garage door. The security officer was in there, knocking to get out. We asked him what had happened and why he was not responding on the walkie talkies and not answering his cell phone. He stated his cell phone had not rung, he removed it from his pocket and it was fully operational with a full signal. I told him to check his voice mails; sure enough there were a couple of messages from staff asking him where his was and if he was okay. He stated he could hear our voices coming through the speaker on his walkie talkie, and was responding. I advised him all we heard was static on the other end.

Apparently as he walked by the garage on his rounds, he could hear movement and voices from inside the garage. There are no windows and only 2 sided dead bolts on both the over head and side doors. Thinking perhaps it was someone from maintenance; he unlocked the walk through door just to check on things. As he opened the door he could still hear voices and movement but it was dark in there and hard to see. He reached over and flipped on the light. As he turned on the light the voices and movement stopped and the door slammed behind him. He did a quick look around the garage (not hard to do as the building is mostly empty space when none of the vehicles are in there). He saw no one or nothing out of order. He turned back to the door, using his master key, tried to unlock the door. He indicated the key would move and sound as if the door was unlocking, but it would not open. He repeated this process a couple of times and tried also to unlock the over head door, with the same results. He then tried reaching someone in the office by the same means we were trying to reach him, the cell phone and the walkie talkie. He indicated this went on for a bout 3 minutes until we arrived.

As we exited the garage we could hear this laughter, like at a movie or play, many voices laughing together. Then nothing. We headed back across the small lot to the office. He confided in me that this time made him uncomfortable.

I do think that the activity has been removed from my actual office, but not the grounds or building(s). As long as this remains harmless, what else can be done? The officers of the business refuse to acknowledge the issue. I can concentrate now and do not feel the fear and anxiety I did when ""it"" was in my office, so...

The Helpful Spirit,"South Carolina, United States",Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: The Helpful Spirit

A few days ago, my husband was on the computer watching videos online. He had his headphones on and the volume up quite loud. Everything was quiet and I knew he had his headphones on, so I didn't try and talk to him. Right when I was about to get out of the shower, he asked me what I wanted. I had no idea what he was talking about since I hadn't said anything to him. He said that he heard someone say his name. He said it was a girl's voice and he said it sounded really similar to mine. The exact same thing happened a day or so later.

Other odd things have happened recently as well. Nothing scary or bad, just weird. There was one day when I had already left for work and he was still home getting ready to go. He tends to forget either his phone, keys or wallet a lot. Well on this particular day, he had walked outside locking the door behind him, thinking he had everything with him. He went down to the truck, only to find that he had left his keys in the house. He called me up and asked me what time I would be home from work, since he had locked himself outside and wasn't able to drive anywhere. I explained to him that I wouldn't be home for awhile. So I guess he just went and sat in the truck to wait or something. He tried turning the ignition without the key, and to his surprise, it turned on! He was able to go to work on the other side of town, the bank and even drive home... All without keys. He tried doing that again to see if maybe his truck was messed up or something, but nothing happened. This all happened on the same day he heard the voice say his name for the first time.

Another weird thing that happened took place last night. We are in a drought right now where we live. So when it started raining last night, we were both really excited! After about an hour of listening to the rain on our tin roof, my husband realized he had left the truck windows down. He panicked, thinking all his tools and such were getting wet. He ran outside, only to find that the windows were all rolled up. He came back in and started saying that his uncle must of come by and rolled them up for him, until we found out his uncle had never come by last night. He swears he left them rolled down. Which makes sense, since the truck doesn't have air conditioning and it gets really hot during the days out here. So how did they end up getting rolled up before it rained? Maybe it was the same spirit that has been calling his name... I guess we'll never know.

I do know that whoever this spirit might be, we are grateful for the help.

My Granfather's Spooky Experience,India,Apparitions / Voices / Touches,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Apparitions / Voices / Touches :: My Granfather's Spooky Experience

T his one is my grandfather's story, rather his spooky experience when he was of my age. It happened to him in the year 1948 (he can never forget that time). In those days, there were forests all around. People were superstitious. But my grandfather was not. One day he was visiting his friend and the way was through the forests. He was on his bicycle.

He was on his way, when somebody called out his name. It was a trembling sound. My Grandfather didn't noticed. Again he heard his name being called out. He ignored again. But when the name was called thrice, he was filled with fear. He thought of nothing but to run. He was pedaling faster. He somehow managed to escape from that place. When he had traveled a little further, he came across a banyan tree. He stopped at it as he saw a man hanging on the tree. He was dead. My grandfather was scared and he was asking for help but there was no one around. He looked in his eyes (which seemed to him very appealing). But all of a sudden, the hanging corpse opened his bloodshot eyes and then he disappeared. My grandfather was scared and he ran away in shock and fear.

He never told this to anyone since then. Only it was when I forced him to tell, he spoke out. He now believes on everything - whether god or evil. I'm sure that he knows something more also but he's not telling.

Recurring Encounters,"Ohio, United States",A Haunted Life,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: A Haunted Life :: Recurring Encounters

I want to start off by saying that I am 16 years old, and have a ridiculous fascination with the paranormal. Ever since I was a little girl, it seems I have experienced many different unexplained situations. Starting when I was about 8 years old. My mother and I have had to move from home to home, after divorcing my father. It seems each home we've moved into, something happens.

One of the first homes we lived in alone, was a half double. I was always afraid to sleep in my room alone. I would often sleep in my mother's room with her. There were many times I would have to go to bed, while she was still up, and I would sleep in her room. Her room was located at the very end of the hallway. My room was of to the side. I would always lay there still awake, and hear things. I would hear the doors from my room and the bathroom creaking, like they were being opened really slow. I understand that it could of been from a draft in the house, but I always had a gut feeling, it was something else.

We never stayed in a house for more than a year or two before moving again. Next we lived in another half double. We had heard rumors that the street we moved to, had a strong paranormal existence. It was a large indian burial site. While we lived in one side, the other was empty. My mother began seeing a man who had a little boy, of about 2 years old. They would sometimes stay over. We had a nice size dining room, that we pretty much used as a 2nd living room. There was a couch that we kept in there also. I would often sleep in there at nights because I was too afraid of sleeping upstairs alone. My mother would most likely always sleep in the living room. But always through the night, I would actually be awoken to the sound of people walking across the floor that I was actually in. The home was older so the floors creaked horribly. It always scared me, but I learned to deal with it and try to shut it out.

One night my mother's boyfriend stayed over with his son. His son was the type of kid who would just open doors on you, and get into EVERYTHING. One morning my mother woke me up for school to get ready. I was in the bathroom getting ready. My mother, her boyfriend, and his son slept in the living room. On the bathroom door, the lock was a hook like lock, that just flipped over to the hole. I was sitting on the sink pulling my hair back, when the door knob started twisting, and shaking all at the same time, as though someone were trying to get in. I quickly was sure it was the little boy who had awoken, so I immediately yelled out ""hold on a second!""

and immediately, it stopped. It was quiet. I jumped off the sink and opened the door. But no one was there. So I went and woke my mother up, not to mention her boyfriend and the kid was sound asleep. I asked if she had needed the bathroom and she said no. I then asked her if one of the guys had woken up and needed it, and she said no. There was no one else that was there, or that lived there.

After we moved, I had a dream of the house, that I had walked in the house, while it was empty, and the only thing there, was a dead lady, laying underneath the window in the living room. I don't know if this was a message... Or just in my head. There are so many more stories. One house we lived at, I had stayed home one day alone, no one else in the home, I was downstairs, while my bedroom was at the top of the steps, I had a baby doll that would pray when you put her hands together and touched. It wouldn't work any other way. I was walking through when I heard the doll upstairs praying. I stopped at the bottom of the steps just listening, there was no other sound/sounds at all. I called my mother hysterically crying and scared to death. My mother is now remarried and we just recently bought a home. We've lived her for a little over a year now. And we have had lots of things happen here.

Within the first 2 months we lived here, things have happened. My bedroom has a huge closet with sliding doors. Inside them is a laundry shoot that leads to the basement. Our basement is huge! And in very good condition we have a living room down there. But the washer and dryer is right beside the shoot. One night I was talking on the phone, it was late. I heard what had sounded almost like a moaning sound of a man, it was very masculine. It sounded as it was coming from the basement. Before I went to my room to go to bed, my stepfather was playing video games in his room, which is directly across the hall from my roof. He is very into football, and gets into it, yelling in such. So at first I figured it was him, but I had been in my room for a few hours since he'd been playing. I kept hearing it and I started to get that gut feeling as if something wasn't right, and it was a very scary sound. So I opened my door, seeing right into my mom's room, it was dark and the tv was off! I ran to the living room hysterical. She was sleeping on the couch and I was just shaking her and shaking her to get up, all I could yell was where's SHANE! Where's SHANE! (my step dad) she asked me what was wrong over and over again, and she said that he had gotten called into work over an hour ago. I was terrified. My mother believes in spirits as well as I do so she believed me.

There was also a time when I was going to sleep, it was late, and from my room, and having the laundry shoot, I can hear perfectly everything in the basement. Either the dryer or washer door was slammed. It was slammed sooooo hard, it was soooo loud! My step dad and mom was home so I figures, oookay that have to be one of them. Then about two minutes later my step dad came in my room and asked if I was in the basement. I told him no. He said he heard it too. But he doesn't believe in any paranormal activity or anything so he just kind of shook it off.

And once my mother was home alone, my step dad was out fishing, and I was out with friends, when she called terrified she said there were banging going on in the house starting in the basement, and sounded as though someone were running up the basement steps banging on the walls as they ran up. She wasn't imagining this, because we have two dogs that heard it as well that were going crazy at the bangs. My mother was so scared she grabbed the phone and ran out of the house. She called my stepfather to come home and even check the house out. My cousin that had stayed over one night, slept on the couch, and the next morning was telling me how he heard what sounded like furniture moving across the floor in the basement. He said he was so scared that he had tears in his eyes and couldn't even sleep. We also have a pool table in our basement that my mother claims she hears during the day sometimes while she is home. It sounds like someone shooting the balls with a pool stick.

Now here's the scary part. My mom was goofing around one day, she had my ipod on and listening to music. She was singing loud and she cannot sing! So I snuck up on her and got my phone out that can video. I put it on her and she finally realized and tried to swap it away. While doing so, you can see in to the kitchen, where for 1 second you can see an old man's face! I had caught it on my camera! He's only there for a second, then he's gone, it just kind of flashes real quick. Me and her were the only ones at home during this. And what's really weird, is that the face has a peachy color, like a real human. Its very clear its an older man. You can make out the nose, eyes and chin. And it looks as if he's bald on the top of his head, with little hair on the sides. We didn't realize we had caught it until about two days later when I was watching it. I can even pause it right on his face. I have done this and showed it to everyone. And everyone says it's a man. My step dad still denies that's what it is.

Myrtles Plantation Tour,"Louisiana, United States",Ghost Tours & Haunted Hotels,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Ghost Tours & Haunted Hotels :: Myrtles Plantation Tour

I have always been interested in ghosts. I don't think I have ever seen one but it was not from a lack of trying. That's probably a good thing because I get spooked easily, but for some reason I insist on doing things to try to scare myself.

Growing up I heard lots of stories about a Plantation in St. Francisville, Louisiana called The Myrtles. As a child all I heard all about the ghost stories. As an adult I am also interested in the history of this place. I had been to the house a few times in passing and had taken pictures but what I really wanted to do was stay the night in this house. It is a bed and breakfast so it's not hard to spend the night there but they do book rooms months in advance to stay in the house.

Well, last year my wish was granted when I got a birthday present from my boyfriend. It was a gift certificate for me to stay one night at The Myrtles Plantation. He only had one stipulation. He was not staying with me. His quote was, ""I don't know if I believe in ghost or not and I don't plan on finding out.""

That was fine with me because I had several friends who were interested in going with me. I called a friend of mine from out of town and asked her if she would meet me at the house for a night. I called the next day to book the room and there next opening was 6 months away so I booked it and waited.

Now I could speed all day telling you about the history of The Myrtles Plantation, between the history tour, the ghost tour and what I have read on line, but there is just too much information. You can Google it and find all sort of information. To start we had a hard time getting into our room. The key would not turn to open the door. My friend went to go get the guy working that day and as they came up the stairs the door decided to open.

We had a great time that night. We took the history tour during the day and the ghost tour at night. We stayed up late and walked the grounds at night. We heard several noises, some could later be explained and some could not. The reason for my story is to show a picture I captured while I was there and to get some of your input on it. I had several pictures with orbs in places there was nothing shiny and no water around. We got pictures that part of the photo was blurry but not all of it.

What I want people to help me with is a picture I took at night. I see a face in this picture clear as day and most people I talk to have said the same thing. A few people say they see nothing, but I don't see how. I am going to attach the picture with the face then a picture taken during the day from about the same place. I also have a picture with the face I see cropped out. You can see the edge of the bridge for comparison.

I am just wondering if there is something there or if its my overactive imagination.

The Ghost of Rich Mountain Battle Field,"West Virginia, United States",Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: The Ghost of Rich Mountain Battle Field

A couple of years ago, my family and I decided to go to rich mountain battle field located in Beverly West Virginia. When we arrived, we knew of all the stories that everyone told about the place being haunted, but the only time that you would experience any paranormal activity would be at night. We arrived around 10:00 o'clock am.

We had brought cameras and wanted to snap some pics to see if we could come up with anything, We all split up into separate little groups and went in all directions. My brother, being afraid, stayed in the truck with my little 5 year old sister who was asleep. I went with my mom and another friend of the family, and my dad went with his friend and his son. You have to remember that this is where a battle during the civil war took place, so it made it scarier for me because I was only 13, but my dad and his friend went and started talking about some guy named john hart, they said some pretty nasty things about him. All of the sudden they heard something coming out of the weeds near where they stood, it sounded like they were being chased by a man it (what or who ever it was) chased them all the way back to the vehicle.

Meanwhile my mom and our friend were just standing around taking some pics when all of the sudden we heard voices coming from the left side in the woods of us, they seemed to be talking about something important because the voices sounded aggravated. But it was just too scary, we all met back up at our cars and discussed what had happened and at the same time my brother chimed in and asked who was standing beside the truck the whole time while we were gone. He thought it was my dad who was with his friend over at the right side of the field and we were on the left side of the battle field at the time.

That's when we all got freaked and left and I haven't been back since.

Night Attacks,"Massachusetts, United States",Old Hags / Night Attacks / Sleep Paralysis,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Old Hags / Night Attacks / Sleep Paralysis :: Night Attacks

I started to really believe that there was an entity in my house this summer when my aunt came over. Being the religious woman she is, she would never admit to believing in that type of stuff, especially letting it scare her. But this time it was different. I don't really know all the details but I do remember it happened on a saturday because she had come to visit from New York for three days and she was leaving on a sunday.

I remember passing by the living room and seeing her crying with my mother by her side. I didn't stop to listen or to ask anything because at the time my gut instinct, as I passed by, just told me not to. The next day after my mother and I had dropped her off at south station in boston mass, as we were driving back home and got stuck in traffic, my mother turned to me with teary eyes and gasped and said ""jenny, your aunt saw him"", the hairs rose on my arms. I knew who she was talking about, it was him, the one we had never seen but felt, the foot steps on the stairs that stopped in front of my room, it was him whom years ago, a dog we had been taking care of, also sensed, and would not leave the front of my door and stayed up all night howling at nothing.

My mom said that my aunt told her that he wasn't good, that he fed off me. Previously, for like 6 months straight, I had become severely ill. My mom and dad and bro are witness to this. Every night at 12:30 or 3:19 I would wake up suffocating. The episodes would last a good minute to the point where I would turn extremely purple. The doctors could not diagnosed it, after some time they just stopped. I had never before related it to that. I had always try to shut it off hoping that that eerie premonition feeling would go away.

After that day my mother and I did everything imaginable, we burned incense, we sprayed holy water. Now that we remodeled most of the house, we haven't felt much. But now something else happens, something that hasn't happened since I was little, now as my grandparents who share a floor with me tell me, I scream in my dreams, but the thing is when I wake up I never remember.

Perhaps it's better that way. Maybe I'll share on my next post... I'd love feedback, thanks.

Andrea's Angry Home,"Texas, United States",Psychic / Medium,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Psychic / Medium :: Andrea's Angry Home

S o, a little prologue is in order. I met this girl Andrea through a self-proclaimed shaman named Andrew. They were both in their early twenties and I was almost seventeen. She and I connected immediately. Andrew even said (before we met) that we were 'reflections of each other'. We both sort of abandoned our other friends for a while and became extremely close.

We never did any ouija together, but it was an unspoken understanding that we were both practicing spiritualists and sensitives. We never bragged about our experiences and there was never any pretense. It was simply a close friendship built on understanding and common personalities. At least it was good for a while...

She lived with her grandparents in a very old home in Grapevine, Texas. Andrea lived in the room that her mother had lived in when she was a girl, and both of them had a lot of issues with depression and drugs. Boy could you feel it... The air was much thicker in that room, and there were strange stains on the carpet and the walls. The stench was unbelievable and I tried to help her clean it more than once.

For instance, one spring evening of 2006 after a rigorous attempt at making her room livable, we decided to walk to the nearest bistro and get some cream sodas. She lived in a suburb next to a very posh part of town, and we shopped there a lot. When we returned, we both paused at the entrance to her hallway.

My eyes were frozen on a strange ancient black and white portrait of a man... or a boy. It was hard to tell. He almost looked like a half gremlin man with a squashed face and a tuft of white hair on his head. His eyes were beady and seemed to come out of the picture. Smoke seemed to surround him in the photo. I can't tell you how frightening it was.

""You haven't noticed that before?"" She asked, getting uncharacteristically quiet.

""Yeah... I also never noticed how many mirrors your grandma has up.""

While I couldn't take my eyes off the strange picture, I also saw both of us in the corner of my eye in the mirror to our left. Only we weren't the only ones there. There was a black mass entering behind us. ""Who is he?""

""My great grand father."" She said staring at the picture along with me. ""I never really met him. But he hates me...""

She started moving down the hallway, her head bowed, and I started following, shutting my eyes tightly from the awful portrait. It wasn't just his strange appearance, it was the seemingly purposeful way he'd been placed in front of the long dark hallway - as if to look you up and down before going into the bowels of the home.

When I opened my eyes again, we were half way down the hall. My heart was beating in my throat and out of nowhere, the black mass seemed to rush around me. I felt something chasing me, and then it PUSHED MY SHOULDER forward as if taunting me. I ran into Andrea's bedroom, as she'd gone far ahead of me.

""I'm not really sure."" She sat on her bed, staring out her window. ""But... never go into my backyard.""

I put my drink on her desk - the desk that had been in her family through three generations.

""Why not?"" I knelt at the end of her bed, my torso resting near her feet.

""I used to go out there, even though I was always scared of it. I heard voices. They never said anything clear it was just jumbled up whispers... So one day I went out there and found a dead bird in the far back next to an old tree. Then I went out the next day... and there was a dead cat in the same exact place. I didn't go out the third. I never go anymore.""

""But what's here, 'Drea?"" I wasn't unfamiliar with these things, but the activity surrounding this family seemed angrier than anything I'd ever encountered.

Suddenly there was a crash behind me. My drink had been thrown of its own accord onto the floor, creating a new stain. I got the distinct feeling whatever energies resided there preferred no one interfered with the messiness of that room.

I just looked at Andrea and she looked at me. Things got progressively worse. Scratching started sounding from the outer-wall along with a strange human groaning. It was too harsh of a scratch to be an animal because the wall seemed to shake along with it.

After that night I tried to keep our visits at my home, because when I tried to convince Andrea we should investigate and try to release whatever spirits were trapped, she seemed almost like she wanted them there, or was too afraid of them. More and more our friendship grew estranged. She started becoming angry and bitter all the time. Her room started becoming infested with roaches and I couldn't stay there at all anymore.

Eventually we stopped talking, but I remember that night so vividly, and I often worry about her.

"The Ghosts of Burma Airfield, Kanpur",India,Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: The Ghosts of Burma Airfield, Kanpur

K anpur, a large industrial city in northern India may not seem the quintessential haunting ground, what with its mammoth population and the appalling lack of living space, but upon driving over to the Military Cantonment side of the city - Napier Road to be precise - one comes across the vast emptiness of the Burma Airfield. Currently known as the Civil Aerodrome, used for imparting the occasional Gliding Lesson to NCC Cadets (sort of like senior scouts and guides) and even more rarely for landing private craft.

During the Second World War the Airfield was one of the many in India used by the British to lend support to their troops. In 1990 - 91, my old man, being an army officer, had taken up residence with the family in 23 Napier Road which was across the road from the aerodrome and I, being 16 - 17 years of age, was discovering the joys of spending time with young women in any degree of solitude.

One evening in the empty moat surrounding the runway, my lady friend and myself were busy doing what teens do and had failed to note the approaching darkness. Determined to finish what we had started and unmindful to the possible dangers of being alone with a buxom young thing in such a lonely place, especially in the crime riddled hellhole that the city is, I had thrown all caution to the winds and wanted a repeat performance but only this time, on the boundary wall of the airfield. As we were trudging blindly through the darkness with my girlfriend in tow, all of a sudden I felt as though my entire body was tightly wrapped up mummy like in a bandage of static electricity and something was happening around us, of which I was acutely aware, but just what it was, I had no means of ascertaining, owing to the darkest darkness I have ever known.

It was then that I realized that we were not the only ones there. Though I could see nothing at all, I had the distinct feeling that we were surrounded by a group of unseen hands who were rapidly centering in upon us from all directions. By this time I had unknowingly left my girlfriend's hand and was half running, urging her to do the same. She seemed unperturbed and complied until she realized that I was no longer running ahead of her, but had stopped someplace behind.

She called out to me with a certain degree of panic in her voice, which I plainly heard but was unable to answer back because my active mind was straining to perceive something that was way beyond my five senses. In the time that it took my girlfriend to stop, turn back, call out to me and return to the spot that I seemed transfixed to, I felt the passing of eternity as though time had slowed down drastically.

In that space of time, I felt as though I was the pole in a Maypole dance and these unseen beings running around me peeling off band after band of static electricity that I had felt was enveloping me. Upon feeling that I was rid of the bands, I wanted to do nothing but get the hell out of there, but the moment I moved, I felt the whole bands of electricity routine start all over again, only this time, in reverse, as though the entities running around me had continued circling me even after completely peeling off the first bands of static.

Again I seemed to be tied up in the same way only this time it was much tighter. The whole peeling and unpeeling process went on Lord only knows for how long. It was only when my friend came back that I was able to move again. Only this time I did nothing but held her hand tightly and beat a hasty retreat out of there. This is the first time that I have ever related this incident to anyone.

Grandmother,"Florida, United States",Family / Friends Visits,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Family / Friends Visits :: Grandmother

H ere's another story that I have for you. I remember when my daughter, now 14, was only 2 months old, my now ex-husband and I were staying at his parents house to watch over the house and take care of his 13 year old sister, Shannon, while they were on vacation in Mexico. We were sleeping in his parents bedroom and our 2 month old daughter, Amberley, was sleeping next to my bedside in her own bed.

I woke up in the wee hours and saw a figure (torso and head) hovering over my daughter as if looking at her every feature. I wasn't really sure what I was seeing. The only light in the room was a dim red light from the clock that was on the nightstand next to me. When this being knew that I has awakened, it stood up straight from a bent over position (like somebody standing bent over looking at the baby sleeping but with no legs) and looked at me, then very quickly came right up to my face as if to study my features (I have got chicken skin bad right now just talking about this) and then I started poking my husband to wake up and turn on the light, but he didn't wake up in time before this thing darted off and went right through the bedroom door.

My husband turned on the light and I told him what had happened. We ended up going back to sleep but the next day after I had time to think about what this beings face looked like, I thought, you know what, this looks like my husband's grandmother who died of cancer (two months before this happened), before she ever got to see her Great-Grandchild or even meet me in person. We went through some pictures of her and I swear to this day it was her. Even though this being had only the top part of the body, when it was right in my face, it was like looking at a real person. She was waiting for us to have Amberley and go up to Alabama and see her but she died so quickly after being diagnosed, that it was too late so she came to finish her business of seeing her grandchild and me!

Apparition with a Blank Face,"Michigan, United States",Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: Apparition with a Blank Face

I 've been haunted for a while, now. Paralysis attacks, cold drifts, pokes, taps and all that good stuff. It doesn't really scare me anymore, because I figure if it were something evil, it would have DONE something evil, other than creep me out on a daily basis.

Well, the other night I was laying in my bed and I was having trouble falling asleep, because I had been fighting with my boyfriend just a little while earlier. I was in a bad mood, and when I am stressed, mad, upset, sad, or angry is when the feeling of presence is most dominant (WHY, I wonder?) I then left my room and went to the living room to turn the t.v. on and relax a little bit.

Now, mind you that I am past the whole ""wild imagination"" stage and am fully aware of what is going on most of the time. Everyone in my house was still awake, so I am positive that it wasn't just me scaring myself. So, I was laying on the couch and glanced out the window for a quick second. We have a flood light that is disgustingly bright on our back porch. I was pretty scared so I wouldn't look for a long time, but every time I glanced over, I saw someone standing about 20-ish feet away from the window. I knew it wasn't a live person, I knew they knew I was looking and I knew it wasn't evil. But, the EXTRA creepy part is that they were wearing exactly what my boyfriend had been wearing earlier that day. I know it wasn't him because he just wouldn't do that. The face of the ""body"" look blank. No eyes, no nose and no mouth.

Haunting Babies at Mokapu,"Hawaii, United States",Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: Haunting Babies at Mokapu

I used to live in Hawaii for about 9 months and I hear many stories about hauntings that take place there. Everything from Night Marchers (the ancestral dead) that walk the island to ghosts in the Pali. I had some strange experience while I was there and I would like to share one with you.

In 2004, there was a girl I really liked. One night I summed up the courage to ask her on a date. We went to a restaurant, drank some wine, and at about 11pm we decided to go to a beach called Mokapu, which is near Honolulu. It was really dark and there was hardly anyone out. We talked about each others lives and experiences and we laid down and listened to the ocean for a few hours. At about 2am strange things started happening. Me and the girl I was with felt our hands being touched by something small. We thought it was miniature crabs, but when we looked, there was nothing there. The moon was full that night so you could see a lot of stuff, but we saw no crabs. Then the weirdest sound was heard by both of us. It sounded like a baby crying. Keep in mind it was 2am and no one was around. The nearest house is about 5 miles away. We kept on hearing the crying. We both thought that it was cat crying or something, but when we looked at the direction of the crying, there was no cat to be found. We kept on feeling our hands being touched too. We both had had enough and we decided to leave. I just put it to the back of my mind thinking that it was crabs and a cat.

Two months later I was sitting with my hair stylist, who is a local, and we began talking about strange things that happen on the island. We were talking about Night Marchers and haunted burial grounds. Then she started talking about Mokapu. I asked what is so scary about that place? She said that a long time ago, Hawaiians used to take the deformed babies and kill them at Mokapu. She told me some people say that if you stay there long enough you will hear them crying. She told me that she heard them herself one night when she was there. The hair on my neck and on my entire body stood up. I told her what happened to me there.

I knew nothing about this story until the day she told me and until now it still gives me the creeps.

Who's in the Basement?,Canada,Poltergeists / Physical Manifestations,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Poltergeists / Physical Manifestations :: Who's in the Basement?

T he house we lived in was creepy as hell already. When my bedroom was upstairs, I found someone had carved into the inside of my closet door ""so-and-so died here on such-and-such a date"" I thought nothing of it and decided some other kid who lived here before wrote it there to scare people.

My mom decided to extend our family with her loser boyfriend... Twice... So as me and my brother were getting older, our bedrooms were moved to the basement. Fine with that... We wanted our privacy from the rents anyways.

One weekend, my best friend decided she was going to come over and spend the night. Now, my bed was much to small for both of us so we decided to sleep on the couch in the basement living room. This room was unfinished and was pretty much the wrecking grounds for me and my brother and whoever we had over. My brother's bedroom was right across from the doorway of the living room, so the moonlight and streetlights brought in a little bit of light. It was getting late and Danielle and I decided to get ready for bed. Being an unfinished basement, we knew it would be cold during the night so we grabbed lots of blankets, turned on some music pretty low and turned out the lights. Danielle was laying on the couch facing the doorway, and I was the opposite. We just talked about the usual 15 year old gossip, when Danielle was in the middle of a story and she stopped talking. ""Who's standing in the doorway?"" she asked. ""What are you talking about?"" I replied, being somewhat afraid of the dark as it is I could feel my adrenaline rising and going into a minor panic.

""There's someone standing in the doorway wearing a trench coat and a black hat""... ""Your joking don't lie to me"" I said to her quietly. She closed her eyes and ""it"" was gone. We sat there waiting for the return of this thing. Minutes passed and nothing, so we continued our conversation. She was in the middle of telling me about some class she was in and how she hated it when I stopped her and said ""Did you hear that?"" On the other side of the living room where we were sleeping was the laundry room. Cement floors, metal pipes on the roof, a creepy storage room, and a bunch of junk and boxes my mom couldn't find room for. ""What did you hear?"" There had been a swish sound across the cement floor that sounded as if someone was pushing boxes. Danielle didn't hear it. Again we listened quietly for the sound to happen again. Nothing.

We continued our conversation, observing everything in case we heard/saw something again. ""Swiiisshhh"". Once again the sound appeared from the laundry room. This time we both heard it. Being the first time that night we both witnessed something odd happening in my basement (and being girls...) we started freaking out. My brother was upstairs watching t.v. And we tried calling him to come downstairs. No reply. We laid there quietly waiting to hear anything... My brother, my mom... ANYTHING. I heard the water turn off from the shower upstairs. So we started screaming for my brother one more time. He came downstairs and asked what the hell we were screaming about. After we told him the stories of what we heard and saw, he didn't seem too worried about it. Danielle and I got off the couch and decided to sleep upstairs. We followed my brother very close up the stairs. As we walked by the hallway looking into the laundry room, we noticed the box in the middle of the floor, and my mom's clothes she hung to dry hanging from the pipes on the roof were swinging back and forth very rapidly. Definitely not something wind could do. Especially since none of the windows were open.

Restless Nights After Doing Cleansings,"Pennsylvania, United States",Family / Friends Visits,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Family / Friends Visits :: Restless Nights After Doing Cleansings

F or those of you who haven't read my previous story , Let me just fill you in briefly. The house my fiance and I are living in has been on the fritz lately. There has been a lot of somewhat negative energy in the house, most of which has been centered around our kitchen. We're not certain if there is one spirit or two, and whether one is good and the other evil, or just one that is angry for it's inability to cross over, or etc.

But we believed one, if not both, was the spirit of michael's grandfather who passed away quite a few years ago. Well, I took the advice of a number of people who posted comments about how I should deal with the situation I'm in, and the results have been effective in some areas, but seem to have worsened the situation in another sense. First and foremost we had an electrician come look at the kitchen light that exploded, and, not much to my surprise, the electrician could find no reason at all as to why it did that. The wiring wasn't freyed, and was up to date, and everything was ""perfect"" according to him. Michael and I decided to take action.

I had a Christian blessing done on the house at the request of my love, and it seemed to calm down the kitchen quite a bit. Objects stopped disappearing, coffee stopped making itself, and the overall negative feeling that was once present had dissipated. But a few days later, Michael and I noticed that the computer room had suddenly become the focus of our resident ghosts antics. Batteries disappeared overnight, the computer started turning itself on and off, and we'd wake in the morning to find papers and mail strewn all over the floor, while we are the only two living in the house and the dog sleeps in our room with us, we keep the door closed.

At that, I decided to have a professional pagan blessing done on our house. The results were similar, but lasted only a week before the antics started up again. Michael and I then began decorating our house with crosses, stars, and other personal religious relics that were meaningful to us. I was charging crystals and putting them in different areas of the house, we pretty much attempted putting up images that we thought might banish the spirit, or at least encourage it to move on, but, much to our dismay the results remained the same, a few days of peace and then more problems. I tried meditating and asking the spirit to leave, which did not work, possibly because I was only half able to focus due an unexplainable eerie sensation I had. I then decided to call a medium to come to our house and contact the spirit, or at least tell us whether it was two, or one, and figure out just what it was trying to accomplish in our house.

I was stunned by what this woman had to say. She told me that the spirit is michael's grandfather, and he chose not to cross over yet because he is waiting for his wife. He has been trying to carry on with activities he used to do when he was alive, like making coffee, moving things to where he thinks they would be appropriate, etc. She even told me where the batteries and kitchen remote were hidden.

But he's angry. Gram Elsie, his wife, had a stroke a few years ago, and since then her children have been fighting over who gets control over what assets and who will get what from the will, including her money her house and her car etc. While she's still alive! The most horrible part is that everyone is so focused on gram's money and belongings that no one is taking care of her, since the stroke she can't really talk very well, and she can't walk. The family has become ""self indulgent and unconcerned with the well being of their own"" that was what the medium said michael's grandfather feels like. Because of it he's been projecting negative energy into the house. I asked the medium to try and help him cross over, and to explain to him that michael and I DO take care of gram whenever she's over at the house, and that we would like for him to stop taking out his anger on us. So the medium preformed a blessing and talked to pap, asking him to please cross over because it was his time. Michael and I took pap's ashes, which used to be in our house, over to where gram was living, so husband could be with wife.

The occurrences stopped. But something's wrong. Although michael and I had an inkling that something was wrong before, and the physical oddities have ceased, something new has arisen and I'm not sure what to think. Not once in the entire time the medium was present did she mention anything about a second energy. But, now every time I go to sleep I have terrible nightmares, very very vivid nightmares that scare me ridiculously, almost to the point of not wanting to go to sleep. They started a few days after everything else stopped. Most of them revolve around me being chased, and there's a knife, although the dreams are enough to cause me to wake up sweating and usually holding my hand to my throat, the most I can remember is a knife and being chased.

Mike had a weeks vacation and slept on the couch most of the time because he said the room just made him feel uncomfortable, I asked him if it was the heat or if it was too cold, but he said neither, he just felt uncomfortable. And another question comes to mind, when mike was young he saw his reflection in the mirror brushing his teeth when he himself was not, and that was while pap was alive, so what caused that? And what about the shadows in the mirrors? And the evil looking face engrained on the back of our bathroom door? Something just doesn't add up.

And I'm worried that maybe we made a mistake in asking pap to move on. Should I attribute the nightmares to all the scary movies on television because of Halloweens approach, or is it something more than that? And if it is something more, what could it be, what kind of energy can elude a medium? I'm not sure what to do.

Girl at the Bottom of the Stairs,United Kingdom,Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: Girl at the Bottom of the Stairs

I don't exactly how to categorize my experience an apparition or physical manifestation, but I am new to all this, so here I go. Living in Bedford all my life, our family was getting bigger. When my middle sibling, Sabrina, was born my parents decided to get a bigger house. So they purchased a four bedroom house not far from my birth home. I remember on the first day there, me and my sister were in our teens, while our parents were moving things from our old home to the new house, me and my older sister were told to look after Sabrina. I remember floor boards were bare and there was floral wallpaper in this one room, which, we were advised by mum and dad to stay in until they returned. I remember having a scared sensation about the house, either because it was big and dark or just plain empty and dull.

Now, a couple of years into living in this house, and disobeying my parents orders to come up late at night, I started to see a young girl aged about 8 or 10 years old, with long black hair draped over her face wearing a white olden days dress with what looked like a cold mist around her. Now every night I went to bed late I would see this girl standing there with head down, unable to see her face, I could feel her eyes piercing the back of my neck always getting a cold sensation rushing to my bedroom, praying and hoping she didn't follow. Even when I came home from clubbing I dreaded turning off the light and taking my first step on the stairs. For years upon years I kept seeing this young girl always calling out to my mum trying to keep some communication with the real world.

A good 13 to 14 years passed and I was convinced I was scaring myself every night imagining this young girl etc. But eventually I told my mum about what I was seeing, and my older sister over heard the conversation and came running into my room to explain how for years if she was the last person coming up would see the same girl, just standing there lifeless. From that point on I knew it could not have been my imagination and my older sister, different being, different mind was experiencing the same thing. My mum soon after blessed the house in her own Indian way and now the house feels more like a home.

Blue Lights,Canada,Orbs / Lights / Mists,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Orbs / Lights / Mists :: Blue Lights

T his story takes place in the late summer/early fall of 2005. In January of 2005, my husband and I purchased a new home which was built in 1870. One evening, my husband and I were sitting in the living room watching tv right next to the living room, is our dining room. All of a sudden, we saw a huge flash of bright blue light come from the dining room.

A couple of later it happened again, a bright blue flash of light. I got up to investigate, and stood in the entrance to the dining room. At the time, we temporarily had a small tv in the dining room as well, this had been turned off all day, but I noticed it was on when I approached the dining room. As I was scanning the room, my eyes were drawn to something I had never seen before. About 5 feet in front of me, towards the ceiling, there was a glowing blue ball of light. It was a little bit smaller than a basket ball, and was perfectly round. It just ""stood"" there not moving, yet I can only describe it as having a lot of energy. This whole time, my boyfriend was just in the next room and it never occurred to me to tell him to come and take a look. It's not that I was frozen, it's just that I was completely surprised and in awe of what I was looking at. I felt as though it was also observing me.

On the other side of the dining room is my kitchen. The blue ""orb"" stayed in that spot for probably 45 seconds. It then ""shot"" down into my kitchen. It moved very quickly, in a matter of a second it was on the farthest side of my kitchen on the floor. As it shot down, it was still blue, but did not do it as a ball. It shot as a smaller ""beam"" of blue light. When it reached the kitchen, it started ""moving around..."" It was around 3-4 feet high, and maybe 2-3 feet wide, and was just a mass of moving blue light. I have a difficult time explaining that part. At that point, I realized I needed to tell my husband what I was seeing. I walked back into the room he was in and told him what I had seen. When we got back to the kitchen, whatever it was, was gone.

About 2 months later, I was upstairs alone in our bedroom. I witnessed the huge blue flash of light out in the hallway. I went immediately down stairs. I wasn't scared of it the first time it happened, but I didn't want to witness it while alone.

Since these two experiences, I haven't encountered the blue light or orb again, and wonder if I ever will. Another time, I was alone in our living room with my stepson. I believe it was the spring following the above experiences. It was around noon, and the sun was out bright. Suddenly the room went completely pitch black for a couple of seconds. There are windows surrounding the room, and the sun was shining through all of them, but the room fell completely black. My stepson asked what had just happened and I told him it was nothing, but it was very unusual and I usually have an explanation for things.

We have experienced other unusual things in this house since day one. Maybe I'll post them on here some other time.

A Ghastly Stalker,"Tennessee, United States",Poltergeists / Physical Manifestations,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Poltergeists / Physical Manifestations :: A Ghastly Stalker

I was at my step-sisters' house in Sherrell's (my oldest step-sister) room playing a game. My two real sisters, Rebekah and Samantha, were there too, and our parents were out grocery shopping. We were all kind of hungry so we decided to go into the kitchen and get some food. When Sherrell left the room and turned off the light, I decided to try to scare Samantha (I sometimes like to reach my arms out and moan like a zombie). I started acting like a zombie when I felt something touching my shoulders. Someone was reaching around my neck! I immediately ran out of the room, thinking it was Sherrell.

But when I got into the kitchen, everyone else was already there. Sherrell was putting a chicken leg into the microwave, which indicated she had been in there too long to have done it. Everyone else was too small to reach my neck anyway, so it couldn't have been them. So I guessed it was a ghost that did it.

Later on, we went back to my house. It was bed-time and I wasn't tired, so I snuck into Sherrell's bed-room. I saw her taking out her phone battery (she said it was dead) as I walked in. We started talking and I got tired and decided to go to bed. When I was about to leave, her cell-phone started ringing. She flipped the phone open, not remembering she had removed the dead battery. It instantly died when she opened it. She came into my room and we locked ourselves in. We stayed there for a while, then the door flung open. But nobody was there. We were both pretty scared, but after a while she decided to go back to her bed-room and go to sleep.

The ghost (or whatever it was) stopped bothering us after that.

The Smiling Spirit,Mexico,Family / Friends Visits,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Family / Friends Visits :: The Smiling Spirit

I have an experience to share with you guys and I hope you can give some advice or tell me your thoughts. The last time my mom and I saw my great-aunt was at my second cousin's debut, which was about 5 or 6 months ago. She died just yesterday in the hospital because of an ulcer problem, but the day before yesterday is not the last somebody saw of her.

Before I can tell you that experience, I'm going to tell you about my great-aunt's life and maybe that will kind of fill in the missing parts of the whole ghostly puzzle. First of all, she is my grandpa's sister (from my mom's side of the family) and she was born a very poor woman. She gave birth to 10 children, one of which was taken away from her because of the insufficient amount of money to bring her home (this was in Mexico, and you know how stingy everybody is over there, especially with money), so the remaining 9 children grew up with her but for some reason for which I have no knowledge of, they all abandoned her and refused to come back to help her with money or health.

In fact, some of the uneducated ones, thought stupidly that it was okay to sneak back to her self-made house and steal the only little money she had. My mom's aunt had to build her own house, out of cardboard and aluminum! Just because everyone refused to lend her at least a smile-building amount of money. I would have helped her myself if I had the money, well, let's continue the story. She was also born with a sort of mental disorder, which means she was a bit... (crazy isn't the right word... Especially not in this case) not all there, but because of that, she was always the life of every party, every debut, every family gathering. She was always that first one to start dancing when the music hit the air, there was always a smile on that calm, gentle face, and she had a HUGE heart. Everybody would always say, ""she has so little, yet she shows us all how to be happy"", and she really did show it. She reached her mission in life... To show us all how to be happy and keep a smile on our faces, no matter what the situation. So many people loved her, but yet, no one chose to lend a hand. She was always happy, she did anything to see a smile appear on the faces of her loved ones.

Okay, let's get to the sad part. She started having horrible pains yesterday to the point where neighbors had to drive her to the hospital, and she died there, a couple of hours later. Many people went to her funeral, and there they sang for her the way she had sang for other people at their funerals. Today, earlier, my grandfather was talking to one of my great-aunt's neighbors about her death. She then gasped and talked about how she had seen my great-aunt earlier standing in her usual corner and she died YESTERDAY. Well, we all see to it as the neighbor seeing the ghost of my great-aunt, standing, waiting... For her 9 children to... Return.

The Girl in The Blue Dress,"Texas, United States",Apparitions / Voices / Touches,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Apparitions / Voices / Touches :: The Girl in The Blue Dress

I 'm sure we all heard of stories of spirits being spotted on road-sides, and being picked up, and requested to be taken to their homes, only to find out that the person had died a long time ago. That's mostly what this one is about, except that it is different in another way.

It happened to a taxi-driver that my parents know, I think that he comes from the family, very distant though. He was driving home late one night, after a long day of working and taking people here and there, he didn't have the energy to really pay attention. He turned onto a road which led to his house, when he saw a girl by the side of the road, she looked like she was waiting for someone. She was wearing a blue dress, a very fancy one that you would probably use for a high-school prom or something, like I said, he wasn't paying attention, but he didn't have the stone-heart to just leave her there, all alone in the night.

He drove up the girl's side and asked her if she needed a ride, the girl nodded and got in the passenger's side of the car. The taxi driver drove along the road, hearing the girl's instructions on how to get to her house. Now, this part of the story might sound completely unbelievable but this is how I was told: the taxi-driver lives in this forest-like area, where there a lot of trees and plant-life, and at the moment he was passing the low part of the forest (or whatever) which means that if you were standing in the forest, you would have to climb upward if you wanted to get to the road, like on a hill. The man was not prepared for this next thing to happen, the passenger's car door was suddenly thrown open and the girl whom the man picked up flew out of the car and into the low part of the forest, the strange part was that he didn't hear the thumping noises from which should have been heard from such violent landing.

He stopped the car, ran out but no matter how long and how hard he looked, he couldn't find the body of the girl he had picked up. The taxi-driver gave up, and just went home, but questions were burning him inside, so first thing the next morning, he followed the directions the girl had given him and arrived to a house. He knocked, asked if any girl by the name of (whatever, I don't know her name), the bad thing was that the people said that the girl had died several years ago. When he asked them how, they said that she had been at a party, when time to leave, she left with her friend because she didn't have a ride. Half-way, when she was about to get home, the passenger's side door flew open and the girl slipped out of the vehicle due to the high velocity and speed at which her drunk friend was driving at, she rolled off the road and into the huge forest trench, a knock on the head from a large tree trunk caused her death several hours later.

Her spirit just reenacts her death, with anyone her has the heart to give her a ride...

The White Spirit,"Ohio, United States",Psychic / Medium,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Psychic / Medium :: The White Spirit

M y story starts off a few years ago. I was still living with my parents in our old house in Ohio. I have a few friends who are into the spiritual world and visit so-called ""haunted"" houses on a regular basis. They stumbled across a book on how to achieve an out of body experience. And after only couple days they came running to me with stories to tell. I have never been very spiritual, I have never truly believe in god. Everything just seemed to far fetched to me. But I have always kept an open mind. So when they began telling me stories, I listened. I wanted to see if what they had experience was true, So I attempted it myself one night.

I pulled the blankets off my beds and left only the white sheets. I took off my watch, necklaces, and rings that I usually wore to bed. I stripped down to just my boxers then climbed into the bed and turned off the light. I picked a single spot on the ceiling and stared at it. After only a few seconds my minds started to drift off, I kept having to remind myself what I was attempting. Otherwise my mind would drift and I would end up just rolling over and going to bed. After about 10 minutes of fighting with this spot on the ceiling, I started hearing static. Humming or buzzing noises. That reminds me of the white static on the tv when the cable goes out. First thing that popped into my mind was that I had left the tv on. But afterwards I realized. that I hadn't. Once this sound came into play, I started feeling weightless. And I could feel myself being lifted off the bed. In my mind I was shouting ""I did it!"" And suddenly everything that I thought I knew about, was wrong. I was so proud of myself.

Then with out a warning, I noticed something moving into my vision from the corner. It was a face, black eyes and no mouth. It looked more like a mask. Surrounding it was long white hair-like streams flowing off the back and rippling like it was floating in water. Beside the floating face was two hands. One on each side and both having the same hair like tentacles off the back. It moved through the air gracefully then came to a halt right above my own face. Staring down into my eyes, and blocking my vision of the spot on the ceiling I focused on. Once I saw this, my heart stopped. And something else entered my mind, My friends words telling me ""if you're not careful, something else will enter your body during your out of body experience"" Just then the white figure jolted towards me and I woke up on my bed sweating.

Now I fast forward through time a little more. I got a few years older and joined the military. Forgetting my experience and marking it off as being a weird dream. I moved all over the world, visiting different countries and seeing what I liked to call ""the opposite side of the world"" But it wasn't to long before we got orders to deploy to war in Iraq. Once I made it down to the desert, something changed again. And I had a horrible dream that my body weighted 100 lbs and I couldn't move. I could hear people walking into my room, but I wasn't able to turn and see who they were. It kind of scared me but I was more amazed at the fact that I couldn't move. Until I heard someone speak of killing me. Then I really got scared and forced myself to snap out of it.

The next night I did some research on the internet and learned about sleep paralysis. I was relieved to find out that I'm not the only one who experience this. And memorized many different ways that people used to over come it. But as I continued to have more and more of these dreams, I started noticing something that looked very familiar. The white figure that I had came in-contact with a few years ago was still hovering over my head. It never looked down at me, But stared at the door. It held its hands up as if it was ready to catch a basketball. And once I made the connection between the two white spirits, I started to get scared even more. What ever this thing was, It had followed me from my home in Ohio. Every night I had sleep paralysis and noticed the white spirit, I would do everything I could to wake up. Even forcing myself to roll out of bed and hit the floor to shock myself back to reality.

In December 06, I was injured in Baghdad. I was air-lifted out of Iraq and placed back in a German hospital for surgery and recovery. After a few weeks they released me from the hospital and I was able to return to the units home base in Germany to wait for my unit to get back from Iraq. As soon as I got back here, I started having the sleep paralysis again. And the same white figure continued to hover over my head. Which ever way I was laying. It always hovered and face the door, without looking down at me.

One night I had been going through relationship problems, and dealing with a lot of stuff in my mind. That I was no longer afraid. I had been thinking about suicide and was not at all afraid to go to sleep. Even though I knew I would have the same dream again. This time when I opened my eyes, the spirit was there. And I decided to roll out of my bed. That way I would wake up, then I could just go back to sleep again because I was in no mood to deal with this spirit. As I attempted to roll out of bed, my feet hit the ground, my knees locked into place, and my head balanced on my neck. My body weight 100 pounds, but for the first time ever during sleep paralysis, I was standing up. I was amazed.

And at the same time, I realized every other time I had sleep paralysis, I was on my bed, under the white spirit. And now, I had just stood up. Without having to look, I knew that this spirit was now staring at the back of my head. Probably only a few inches away. If it hadn't known I was there before, I was for sure that it knew now. This struck the fear into my heart again, and the only thing I could think of was to get away from it. I focused my entire mind on taking a few steps towards the door, and my body moved. Slowly, like walking through mud. But I was making progress. I never turned around to look. As I went around a corner towards the door, I nearly ran into another figure. This one was completely black, like a shadow. And stood like a man, much bigger then I. Once I saw this other figure, my knees began to give out, and I fell against the wall. Then dropped the floor. Once I hit the floor, I woke up.

The next day I spent thinking about the night before. Playing it through my head over and over and over again. I didn't want to tell anyone. No one would believe me anyways. But also, I think I might have been wrong about the white spirit that stayed over me. I started to piece together, how it never looked down at me, but instead always stared at the door. And how it seemed to keep its hands up, like it was ready to defend something off. Perhaps the one thing that I have been so afraid of lately has been the one thing protecting me while I slept. But if that's true, then what are these shadow figures that seem to prowl outside my door and wait to come in.

What will happen if this guardian white spirit suddenly leaves and never comes back. And why has it chosen me, and stayed above me for so long? All these questions repeatedly pass through my mind. Everyday. And I can never come up with a solution. Which is why I'm looking for outside help. I'm hoping if I post this story, and throw up some sort of flag. Someone will read this and be able to give me insight into what I'm dealing with. Or even if all I'm doing is having a dream that keeps relapsing. Any help at all would be greatly appreciated.

Ouija Seance with Beelzebot,"Colorado, United States",Ouija Board / Seances,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Ouija Board / Seances :: Ouija Seance with Beelzebot

I 'm a Christian and I've been told many many times not to do things like practicing magic or doing ouija board or stuff like that. Usually I don't because I'm not that interested in it, but one night, my friends and I got together and decided just to try her older brother's ouija board.

It didn't take long for things to get out of control. We began to ask very personal questions. I asked if my friend had a crush on anyone and if so, who. My friend was denying the fact that she liked a guy, but I could tell she was lying. I placed my hand on the pointer but it was cold. Freezing, like ice. I pulled back quickly, and the pointer moved my itself, telling us who she liked. She freaked out, firstly because it moved by itself, secondly because it was right.

We kept it up, asking more and more personal questions and finally my guy friend got the courage to ask, ""Who is in the room with us?""

I flipped. I couldn't help myself. I grabbed the board and with strength I didn't know I had, I ripped it in half, and then quarters, and then eighths. (I seriously don't know where this strength came from!) I took the pointer and threw it in the bonfire (we were out camping).

Since this board wasn't mine, my friends tried to stop me. As soon as I'd destroyed the board, I turned and asked if they knew who beelzebot was. They shook their heads. I told them it was Satan.

After that incident, I have never ever in my life done anything like that again.

The Dining Specters of Fulton's Underground Restaurant,"California, United States",Ghost Hunting,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Ghost Hunting :: The Dining Specters of Fulton's Underground Restaurant

I can't live without my cell phone. Last week, I get a call from my cousin (I'm not saying which one), but he asked if I received a call from some mysterious person. I kept asking him what he was talking about, then he kept keying me in on some of the conversation from this mysterious person. I knew exactly then what he was talking about. I got a call, from some guy claiming he belongs to L.I.T. (Logistics Intelligence Taskforce), that their group is a secretive group controlled by a VIP, who doesn't want to be identified because of his position. He doesn't want to be associated with the paranormal, as if he had some kind of political ties. LIT is supposed to meet me at a private airport off Freeport Blvd and drive me blindfolded to a home that is plagued with a demonic entity. They want me to write the story. I was pretty excited about this and told Shannon 'Ms. Macabre' McCabe about it. Come to find out it was my cousin that played out this prank on me and had one of his buddies pretend he was the lead investigator of LIT. Ha...ha, very funny cuz, wait until I see you at the next family reunion, you won't be laughing then! My cousin would not confess that he was behind the OSIR call that I received before going to the Mount Shasta UFO/Bigfoot pre-investigation, but I suspect he was behind that one too! Oh by the way, if you want to see some of the cool photos we took at Mount Shasta, click on this link . This photo album was put together by Holly DeLaughter.

Let's talk about some of the calls I received this Saturday, October 20, 2007. A lot of my calls are from HPI. Michele Stump, researcher of HPI discusses an upcoming scouting mission involving two cemeteries in Oakland. One cemetery has the grave of Elizabeth Short aka The Black Dahlia and the other cemetery has the graves of the victims of the Peoples' Temple Guyana Mass Suicide. A strong possibility that there could be some residual haunting activities at both of these cemeteries? We will find out soon! Holly DeLaughter, investigator calls, she briefs me on another scouting mission involving sightings of Bigfoot in Mendocino County and the Round Valley Massacre residual hauntings. Chris Grissom calls and tells me about the Diamond Springs residential haunting investigation last Friday. Hanoko Zeidenberg calls and says she is going to be late for the Nancy Bradley - A Night at the Enchanted Cottage. Hanoko and a lot of the HPI members booked a seminar with Nancy Bradley - Psychic for the Stars and later get to investigate the Enchanted Cottage which is the office of Nancy Bradley and the office of Nancy's husband Robert Reppert of Gold Rush Ghosts. Why will they investigate the Enchanted Cottage, you might ask? Because it's extremely haunted. Wait until some of the newer members experience the haunted stairwell. I can't wait until I get the reports of the Enchanted Cottage investigation from paranormal investigators that attended like Lisa Holt, Chris Grissom and Debbie Talani. Of course Nancy Bradley will probably email me with a story about this night, she's such a sweetheart!

Well, on this night, I didn't go to Nancy Bradley's house, instead I went to Joey and Jean Paman's Hawaiian Luau Anniversary Party! Going to this party, I wasn't completely away from HPI. Joey and Jean Paman, Lou Paman and Dee Pizarro were at this party and all 4 are HPI paranormal investigators! So, with the 5 of us there, there was a lot of ghost talk at this party. I had people coming up to me and saying...""are you the ghosthunter?"" One guy talked to me for almost an hour about his own paranormal experience, while I was trying to enjoy the buffet of Filipino food that was laid out at this party. There were hula dancers, a live band and DJ music, the atmosphere was festive. Even though I was at this party, I still couldn't get away from the paranormal. There were many curious people asking me questions and I found myself telling the Marysville full body apparition sighting and the 'being touched' Folsom cemetery story over and over again. As I watched Jean Paman's daughter do the Hawaiian fire dance, my mind drifted of seeing a fire dancer on top of a roof in San Francisco during the San Francisco Haunted Haight Tour and saying to Shannon...""only in San Francisco would you see something like that!"" I mingled with the crowd and spotted my godson Mark Edward Landon Crews at this party and blew bubbles with my godson, he's only a little kid, so blowing bubbles with his dad Dirk and I, made him laugh. While I am headed home from this party, I get one more phone call, it's from Dead Pete. Dead Pete is some guy who claims he is a real zombie. Well, was once a real zombie. He wants me to meet him and interview him, but I am a bit hesitant due to his aggressive style of talking. I listened to his story and he claims he was vacationing in Haiti. He had a fling with a Haitian girl and her father is a Voodoo Shaman of the island. When the Haitian girl he had a fling with, saw him with another Haitian girl, he was a marked man. One night in a disco, he is stabbed in the arm with a hypodermic needle. He passes out and awakens in a coffin. He is buried alive. He is paralyzed, but is aware of his surroundings. He is dug up from his grave and he is used as a slave, picking sugar cane for 6 months. He somehow gets out of this comatose state of mind and escapes the island and heads back to California. He claims to this very day, he has skin lesions on his arms, legs and torso, because of his zombie transformation in Haiti. It's a great story, but I'm not buying it and if he sounded somewhat normal, I would probably personally meet him and find out his full story. Yep, I get a lot of strange calls on my cell phone from prank calls from my cousin, discussing the paranormal with fellow HPI members and then talking with a zombie!

Enough of my cell phone conversations, let's talk about something else. Sometimes a ghosthunter/ghostwriter needs a break from ghosthunting, so this Luau anniversary party was a breather for me. I had another breather last week, when HPI threw a Halloween Costume Party at the Sierra 2 Center. It was a lavish party in which I came dressed as the Grim Reaper and surveyed the crowd and saw witches, vampires, a Klingon, the three Stooges and more. In fact some familiar faces were: Tony and Jennifer Baca, Carol Gillis all dressed as vampires, Debbie Talani, Shannon McCabe, Athena Quinn and Holly DeLaughter, all dressed as Renaissance ladies, Tim Hawkins dressed as a Scottish boy in a kilt, Donna Reynolds as a witch, RV Scheide and Larry as themselves - newsreporters for the News and Review, John Wachter/Michele Paykel, Joey and Jean Paman, Bruce Farrington were all dressed as pirates, Angel Kesti as herself, Jenna DeLaughter as Little BoPeep, Chris Grissom as a Fed Ex Driver, Robert Reppert as Alice in Wonderland's Madhatter, Lou Paman and Dee Pizarro as themselves. HPI is not always about work there is time to play, so after eating a ton of snacks and assorted food and tasting some of the fine wine, I ballroom danced with Shannon, as her husband Bruce DJ'd and then did some killer disco moves (well, I thought in my mind, they were killer moves) to Disco Inferno by The Trammps and Thriller by Michael Jackson. Yep! It was party time for HPI!

Before I talk about the Fulton Restaurant investigation, I am wondering if the Mayan prediction of 2012 is really starting to come to fruition? As I watch CNN News, there are two things that I have been focusing on. I see the rise of 2 of the Horsemen of the Apocalypse. The two are Plague and War. Why? There is the 'superbug', a staph infection that can become the flesh-eating bacteria that has been hitting high schools, causing the death of a 17 year old boy. This could be the Apocalyptic Horseman known as Plague. Then I hear that Russia has allied itself with Iran and feels that Iran has every right to continue with their nuclear activities. Russia does not want America to interfere and retaliate with a preemptive strike against Iran. Could this be a second Apocalyptic Horseman, that we all know as War? When I heard this, I had a dream that we were going to be involved with a few nuclear strikes in the year 2008 or 2009. I hope I am wrong, but my dream was pretty vivid. Maybe I was thinking too hard about the new cold war with Russia. I hope this was just a dream and not a premonition.

Enough gloom and doom, let's talk about the paranormal investigation of Fulton's Underground. Here is the haunted history of Fulton's as written by Master Hunter:

Standing across the street from Fulton's West End Bar and Grill in Old Sacramento, one might easily get the impression that an entire building is missing. But closer inspection reveals an opening in the wrought-iron fence, leading to ancient brick stairs that descend surreptitiously into a quaint courtyard. The surrounding walls that form this secluded, outdoor caf, hold 150 years of often turbulent history, which supposedly manifests itself in occasional unexplained occurrences. Situated at the confluence of two rivers, Sacramento was plagued by repeated floods, with no less than five during its first 12 years. After 1862, residents decided that the existing levees were insufficient, and raised the level of the entire city by 12 feet. As a result, the first floors of the existing buildings became the basements, or were abandoned entirely. The building that houses Fulton's predates the raising of the city, and the old brick retaining walls which were constructed are clearly visible in the restaurant's main dining area. Much of the labor was done by Chinese immigrants, who came to California in droves during the Gold Rush. Being the manager, Brian Rodriguez spends a lot of time at Fulton's late at night, after the customers and most of the staff have already gone home. He admits that he doesn't particularly like being in the building alone. ""You get this weird feeling,"" Brian said. ""It's like someone's watching you, someone's checking you out. You don't even have to see anything."" He admits, however, to glimpsing occasional shadows, which he tries to tell himself ""must be explainable."" The restaurant's previous owner, who sold the business in November, 2004 and moved to Denver, Colorado, swore that there was something very strange about the place, Brian said. Brian believes that Fulton's may have been the site of an old mission. The building later served as the assessor's office, and at one time, may even have been used as a jail. April Williams has tended bar at Fulton's for six years. Shortly after she started, she found that on some mornings, chairs inside the restaurant had been turned backwards during the previous evening. April, as well as other employees and patrons, have also felt certain cold spots -a phenomenon often associated with spiritual activity. As an experiment, a customer once took home a vase of dried flowers from one of the ""haunted"" dining booths, where patrons had sometimes complained of chilly drafts. When she woke up the following morning, the chairs at her dining room table had all been turned backwards. She promptly returned the flowers. April said that the staff usually warns new waitresses not to be alarmed by the occasional tugging on their skirts by unseen individuals. In the past, servers have been so unnerved that they have quit. April has never had a ghost tug on her clothing, but she recalls standing near the back of the restaurant one day, and feeling drops of liquid on her head. Looking up, she expected to see wet paint or leaking water from the rafters, but there was no sign of either. In 1992, a waitress claimed to have seen the spectral figure of an Asian man with a ponytail. Although the apparition was first spotted in the banquet room, he has appeared other places since then. In October, 2005, a pair of mother and daughter psychics visited Fulton's, and pointed out certain areas where they said that people had died. The so-called Mafia Room - a large, private space with an oblong table and paneled, wood walls- gave off such negative energy that the two women refused to even enter. Shortly after the two psychics departed, Brian got a lesson in humility. He was joking with some of his employees about their haunted workplace when a large, potted fern about 20 feet from where he was standing suddenly fell over, making a loud clang. The group bolted from the room. Brian is a bit more careful about what he says now...""

On this day, I brought along HPI paranormal investigator Debbie Talani that has the inside scoop about Fulton's Underground restaurant. Debbie introduced me to Brian Rodriguez, the General Manager. Fulton's Underground is located at 900 2nd Street in Old Sacramento. I began the interview process with Brian and Debbie both. Debbie was once a waitress at Fulton's and has had her own experiences. From my interview with Brian and Debbie, this is what I gathered.

Sometimes chairs are turned around backwards from the dining tables. Certain areas of the restaurant has a 'weird' feeling to it. At times the patrons and staff feel like they are being watched, this especially happens in the pool table area of the restaurant. One night a patron claims he saw a man and a woman sitting at a booth, as if they were enjoying their dinner and when the patron continued to watch this couple having dinner, they no longer were there. There is a place in the cellar where people feel the presence of a lady that sits in the corner, they feel that she is unhappy with the remodeling of this restaurant. In one area room, called the Mafia Room, there are stories that people died in this particular area and the feeling of gloom sometimes is felt by the workers. Note: Many people lost their lives in Old Sacramento, due to the flooding of the Sacramento River. This room is called the 'Mafia Room', because of the way the dining table and chairs are set up, it's like a scene from the movie Goodfellas. Many people have felt presences in the Mafia Room. The Mafia Room is notorious for it's chairs being moved. There was a night that a waiter had left the Mafia Room and came back to find the chairs on top of the dining table. Another time a waitress felt a hand placed on her shoulder, when she looked back, no one was there.

Brian has heard many stories, when he is alone in the restaurant, he simply ignores any strange sounds and brushes off the fact that he is being watched and continues his work. Sometimes when they are cleaning up, they place the chairs on the table and when returning, the chairs are mysteriously placed back on the floor. Some people smell a strong odor of perfume in certain areas of the restaurant. In fact Debbie remembers one time the perfume smell was so strong, that it seemed to have a life of its own and started moving from room to room, then it dissipated and the smell was completely gone. When Debbie worked at this restaurant, she remembers customers telling her that menus were snatched from their hands from an unknown presence. Brian remembers how some menus were neatly snacked and put away, then later that night the alarm was set off and he had to come back to check on the alarm and found all of the menus on the floor. Many of the workers dread going into the linen room, even Debbie doesn't like this room and will not enter it anymore. When I walked into the linen room, I felt a heaviness in the air. After interviewing Brian, Debbie and I decided to have dinner. The dinners here are tremendously delicious. Debbie had the cheese pasta plate, with salad and tea. I had the chicken parmesan with beef vegetable soup and a Coke. The food here is tantalizing to the tastebuds, I savored each bite of my melted cheese chicken breast. As Debbie and I ate, Debbie tells me how one time a wine glass broke in half and the bottom portion of the wine glass flew onto a customer's lap. Debbie tells me that on other times, forks have been snatched out of customer's hands.

After we dined and I took a few digital photos of the interior of the restaurant, we got back in my vehicle 'Ghost Tracker' and headed to an unknown location. Debbie said she had a surprise for me. She took me to a residential haunting, a home we will call the Hess Home. The occupants bought the house in 1987 and the paranormal activity started in 1990. I will detail the accounts of the activity in each room as told to me by Occupant #1 and her two children and mother.

Kitchen: Stove knob once popped off on it's own and flew 10 feet. The coffee machine turns off and on by itself, this has occurred three times. The faucet would drip three times and then stop, this process continued three more times and the occupant told the faucet to stop and it did.

Living Room: The occupant's brother died in this house, he had heart problems and in his weakened state, he would knock three times on the wall for assistance or help from the family members. When he died, the occupants of the Hess Home, heard the three knocks on the wall the following night, as if the occupant's brother was still alive. Occupant #1 once felt something was in the corner and felt a gentle stroke on her arm. Sometimes their cat Lynx goes crazy in the living room, like he feels something is around and darts around the room like he is crazy or on catnip.

Backyard: The backyard is huge, with a beautiful swimming pool and jacuzzi. One day Occupant #1 was taking a picture of her son at the storage area where her brother would keep his things. When she saw the photo of her son, he was surrounded by a strange white mist. Jiggs, a Yorkshire Terrier and family pet is buried in the backyard and Occupant #1 feels at time, that Jiggs plays with her cat Lynx. Lynx has been observed by the occupants of playing with an unknown friend in the backyard. I was shown where Jiggs is buried.

Hallway: Lynx the cat sometimes stares at the wall as if he sees something and then starts running up and down the hallway in a frantic. In one digital picture taken by Occupant #1, there appears to be a purple ray coming from the ceiling. We both determined that it was a reflection from the hallway light, but can't understand why the light ray is purple in color. Occupant #1's children have seen 'shadow people' near the hallway bathroom and across the hallway area. Both children attest that they have witnessed 'shadow people'. Occupant #1 feels that there is two entities in this home, one entity is possibly her brother.

Brother's Room (which is now her son's room): TV turns on by itself. Fan turns on by itself. This is sometimes the hottest room in the house. When walking into this room, I noticed that the atmosphere seemed somewhat gloomy.

Occupant #1's Bedroom: One night entering this room, the doorknob would not move and the door would not open. She struggled with the door and finally after a long time, the door just opened. The TV in this room has turned on by itself. Another night, they all heard a strange scratching noise in this bedroom and Lynx the cat freaked out. Then the scratching noise stopped. One of the most mysterious things that happened in this room is that a mysterious green dot appeared on the wall. She tried to remove the dot to no avail. There was no light source for the dot, because when she placed her hand over the dot, the dot did not appear on her hand. Then the next day the green dot mysteriously vanished. There is a strange discoloration on the walls and there is no explanation for the discoloration. The atmosphere in this room, seemed heavy at times.

Occupant #1's Mother's Room: The mother says that at times she hears a knocking on the shower door. The strangest event is when a loud crash sound emitted from this room, when all of the occupants ran into the mother's room, both shower doors were completely shattered for no apparent reason.

Special Note: Occupant #1 is part of the Wiccan culture and has a gazing ball in the backyard and steps that read 'magickal'. She is also a Harry Potter fan and her license plate reads 'HGWZXPS' - if your a Harry Potter fan, figure that one out. The license plate frame reads: King's Cross - Platform 9 3/4.

I sat in the Occupant #1's brother's room for a long period of time. I used my Listen Up sound enhancer and I asked if there is anyone here? After asking the same question several times, I finally got a male's voice whispering...""yes"". Then I asked is there anything you would like to say. I said this several times and the answer was ""why?"" Digital photos were taken of the Hess Home and in one photo, there seems to be hollow circle orbs. In one photo there are two hollow circle orbs and the next photo shows one hollow circle orb. The third photo shows no hollow circle orbs. This is the first time I have ever taken pictures of hollow circle orbs, usually I take pictures of round ball like orbs of various colors. While talking with occupants, we did hear some strange sounds coming out of the garage area, like small knocks.

Took digital photo of the Mafia Room and captured a small orb against the wall.

At the end of this paranormal investigation, I head home after dropping Debbie Talani off and get a call from my neighbor Nick Asevedo. Nick once lived in a haunted house in Reno and believes the ghosts of this haunted house now reside in his home in Elk Grove. He believes the ghosts followed his family from Reno to Elk Grove. He tells me that his blender turns off and on, he captured an orb shot when taking a picture of his son, the TV switches channels on its own and claims his girlfriend has witnessed this too. Now here is the funny thing, his house is across the street from my house. I tell Nick...""yes, I will do a preliminary investigation of your house sometime next week..."" I tell Nick goodbye and then the thought comes into my head...""it never ends...""

As I write this article, I get another call on my cell phone. This time it's a lady I will call 'Rotunda' in Compton. She is crying, she is frantic because an entity in her home is scratching her daughter. She does not want to get off the phone with me. As we are talking an ungodly deep male voice is heard on the phone about 6 times. She asks if I am the one making this noise. I tell her...""no ma'am"". She becomes even more freaked out. I suggest having her church bless her home, we say prayers together on the phone and I keep her on the line as I look up on the Internet for Los Angeles based paranormal groups. I send out emails to 4 Los Angeles based groups, letting them know that this woman needs immediate assistance. I give her Janet Milchak, psychic and spiritual counselor's phone number, so she can talk with Janet, to calm her down through this crisis. I inform Shannon McCabe immediately, who will do a follow-up with this lady. The chills went up and down my spine, as I heard this strange deep male voice on the phone, while this poor woman is begging for help. I ask the lady if there is a power pole near her home and she says there is a power pole directly in front of her house. In most cases with extreme activity like this, homes are near power poles where entities are able to feed off the energy from these poles and are then able to move objects and touch people. I suggest that she stays with a friend this night and she says she will. She thanks me profusely for staying on the telephone with her and says she is calling Janet immediately. While we were talking, she saw three shadows moving towards her and she becomes more frightened. As I was talking with her, the goosebumps were all over my arms and I felt chills going up and down my spine. I am usually never scared of anything, but the thought of this poor woman and her daughter being terrorized by an unseen force made me scared for both of them. I will say prayers for them tonight and hope a paranormal group will assist her through this horrible ordeal. Godspeed to them both.

My Brother is Experiencing a Poltergeist,"California, United States",Poltergeists / Physical Manifestations,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Poltergeists / Physical Manifestations :: My Brother is Experiencing a Poltergeist

A s you may know, I recently wrote a story about my experience in my brother's old apartment last summer. This time, it's not me who's experiencing things. It's my brother, and it's in his new apartment, just blocks from the one where I experienced what may have been his landlady's dad's spirit. We think this new one in his new apartment is a poltergeist, but we're not quite sure. Hopefully some of you can help explain this.

Let's start with what my brother calls his ""bed scare..."" This happened to him about two weeks ago. He had been through a pretty eventful day with his new job. He decided to play all the day's events back through his mind over sleep. As he was lying in bed, he felt the hair stand up on his arms, and the back of his neck. He started having feelings that he wasn't alone. Then, before he knew it, he felt something creep up from the end of his bed and lie next to him. He froze in terror. He could actually feel it's breathing in his ear, and feel it moving around. Then, he got up enough courage to tell it to leave. A few seconds after he did that, the breathing in his ear stopped, he no longer felt that he wasn't alone, and the whole atmosphere changed back to normal.

Some other ""poltergeist like"" activity started occurring about 4 days after. He came home from work, and found that the pillows on his couch had been set down on the ground, all lined up in a neat fashion. He also found ALL of his lamps and lights on, as well as his ceiling fan in his room on. He told me that he makes sure that EVERYTHING is picked up and turned off before he leaves for work, and he's is VERY sure that he turned everything off and picked everything up that morning before work. This same thing happened the next day, and then suddenly ceased.

Another minor thing was that he would be sitting down eating dinner in his living room watching TV, and the TV would turn off. It would be off for a minute or two, then it would turn back on. This happened several times, and he made sure that no one shorted a breaker or anything like that. One night when this happened, he finally got so mad that he said loudly ""TURN IT BACK ON PLEASE!"" He told me that not even a second after he said that, the TV turned right back on.

All of the activity ceased for about two weeks, until two mornings ago, when he had another ""bed scare,"" and it happened the same way the first one did. I was just wondering if any of you had any idea what this is. We think that it might be a poltergeist created by all of his tension and stress and negative energy, but we're not sure. Thank you so much everyone!

"Annatole, Friend from Beyond!","California, United States",Ouija Board / Seances,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Ouija Board / Seances :: Annatole, Friend from Beyond!

M y best friend brandon's house was re-built in the 1800's after a fire. In that fire burnt a family of 3, a mother, a father, and a little girl. I loved to go to brandon's house and play with his ouija board, we never picked up on anything before... Until now. It was my cousin Amber, me, and our friend brandon (we were at his house of course). He brought out his home-made ouija board (it was cardboard with letters from another ouija board glued on and it was laminated).

We placed our fingers on and asked ""is anyone there?"" At first nothing, I had said ""why are we even doing this again?"" We asked again ""is there anyone there?"" and yet again nothing, so amber and brandon took their fingers off the board and I was bored so I tried again ""is anyone there?"" it started moving slightly, it didn't give an answer, just started moving so I told amber and brandon to put their fingers on again and we asked ""can you move again?"" nothing happened, I tried it alone I said ""are you there?"" it went to yes very slowly, I tried another question ""boy or girl?"" it only spelt out g-i-r then stopped. I said ""a girl?"" she replied yes, I kept asking questions ""what's your name?"", this time she spelt out the whole thing A-n-n-a-t-o-l-e. I said ""that's a beautiful name, how old are you?"" she said 9, I continued asking questions such as... Where you in a fire? (yes) why didn't you answer before? (brandon) brandon? (I don't like him?) why? (he slams the door) is it too loud? (he's messy).

I started laughing, I asked where are you? (behind the door) I was shocked at this answer, stupidly I got up and looked behind his door (well in his closet) I went back ""I can't see you"" (not the closet). I kind of got scared after that, so amber started using it ""do you like me?"" (no) ""do you like Nadya"" (yes I do), well amber continued to ask questions and she said she was a demon sent from hell to kill brandon and she said my soul mates name is Benjamin.

I haven't talked to her since brandon's board got thrown out accidentally, but every time I go in his room, I wave hi and say ""hello annatole"".

These words aren't exact, I just remember some things she said because they affected me, they were either really funny or really scary, but we did write these questions and answers down so we can remember.

It was friday and I was sleeping over at my friend brandon's house it was after our ouija encounter with annatole after a while I was getting bored so I went to the living room to get my backpack, while I was looking through my pack I kept hearing noises from the kitchen, I thought it was one of his cats (he has 5), after about the 3rd time I heard something, I went into the kitchen, I saw a women with her face half burnt in the kitchen, facing away from the stove. I ran to brandon's room. I hadn't told him what happened, he said he had heard crying so I told him what I saw, he said we see her all the time, next thing we know there's another noise so we say ""if anyone's here please let us know"", well nothing happened, so I said ""they're scared they wouldn't dare do anything with the both of us in here"" (I said that because I hear if you provoke a spirit, they'll do something, it couldn't have been his family because they were in west virginia so we were all alone). All of a sudden we heard banging on the ceiling and the mirror above his bed fell down, not even an inch from where he was sitting, almost hitting his head. We went quiet for a minute, then started smelling something burning, we saw smoke from under his bed, so he moved it, then we saw the floor smoking. After the smoke cleared there was a tiny triangle on his hard wood floor (maybe 2 inches) we ran out of that room so fast and ended up calling someone to take us to my house...

Always Watching,"Florida, United States",Family / Friends Visits,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Family / Friends Visits :: Always Watching

I was around 13 years old, I was living in my grandmother's house at the time. My grandfather had died when my mom was 13, so I was unfortunate to never meet him. I went to middle school in Palm City, and the school didn't start until 9'oclock so I was left alone for a couple of hours in the morning. It wasn't until one morning I was getting ready for school, I walked into the kitchen for a glass of juice. I placed my glass on the counter and I happen to look up through the window that looks into the hallway. I was startled to see a man looking back at me, literally he was standing two feet from me, I dropped the juice and ran out of the kitchen. I noticed that I didn't hear any footsteps, I turned around and there was no one there, the man had vanished. I called my mom up at work and told her, she said that it was nothing and to go to school.

Later I told my grandma and she said that she was not surprised that I saw him. After questioning her, she told my that my grandfather died in the house, which he had built. That she had seen him many times, as if he was watching over his family. I only saw him once after that, he was standing in the same hallway looking almost sad and then vanished, it was the day I moved out.

Whispers,"Arizona, United States",Apparitions / Voices / Touches,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Apparitions / Voices / Touches :: Whispers

I have never really had a paranormal experience so personal before. But this morning the strangest thing happened to me. I slept over at my boyfriend's apartment last night and woke up this morning by myself. He had already left for work and I was waking up to get ready for work. His bathroom is in the same room as his bedroom, and I was in the bathroom about to do my make up when I heard a soft whisper, I looked over by the bed and no one was there.

I noticed the window was open so I walked to it and looked out, no one was around. I thought I was just hearing things and went back to the mirror. Then I heard it again, only it was louder and I was almost positive it was my name. Then about 10 seconds later I hear it again only it stretched out a little more, so I was sure it was saying my name. By this point, I had goose bumps. I wasn't sure if I was losing my mind or if someone or something was actually saying my name. Then it said it again only a bit quieter this time.

I just took my stuff and left the apartment and went to work early. I have no idea what had just happened to me, but it was the strangest experience I have ever encountered. Does anyone have an idea of why it happened?

Lizzy's Friend,"Indiana, United States",Children Who See Spirits,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Children Who See Spirits :: Lizzy's Friend

F irst, let me begin this story by telling you that until these events, I was a complete skeptic. Other than God, if I couldn't see, I didn't believe. I do now! It was 1992 and the end of Desert Storm. My husband is in the military and at the time was still in Kuwait. So being lonely, I took our two and a half year-old daughter, Elizabeth (Lizzy), and moved back home with my family. My mom, younger sister and brother lived in an older, yet well established part of our home town. I thought it was the perfect place to wait for my husband, that was until my daughter made a new friend.

One evening my mom and I were in the kitchen preparing dinner, and my daughter was playing at the table. For some reason I turned to look at her and she was just staring down the short hall to an open door at the end. This was my sister, Lisa's room. Lizzy was shaking like a leaf and she was literally white as a ghost. Then she just started crying. My first thought was she had some kind of seizure or something. Then as she sat in my lap, she kept pointing down the hall, crying and saying ""Tell her to leave, I no like her"". My mom and I looked at her and each other kind of dumb-founded. We knew she could not be talking about my sister, she loved her aunt ""sisa"". This went on for about 15 minutes until my mom and I promised Lizzy we would make ""her"" leave.

After settling Lizzy down with my brother, Lance, in the living room, we began our search for what could have been the reason for her apparent fright. We found nothing or nobody.

We had more or less forgotten the incident, until about a month had went by. Once again my mom and I were in the kitchen and this time Lizzy was in the living room playing. Alone. Or so we thought.

I heard her carrying on a one-sided conversation, yet it sounded as if she was talking to someone. I went around the corner, just to peek in to see if things were o.k. She was sitting on the couch with her head turned to the left talking as if someone was sitting next to her. I asked who she was talking to, her reply was ""The girl from Sisa's (Lisa's) room"". I went completely cold. I went in, picked her up and quickly went back into the kitchen.

This was not the end. This continued for about 6 months. She would have conversations and play with ""The girl from Sisa's room"". My mom tried to convince me it was just an imaginary friend, common for only children, but I had my doubts. Then one day it just stopped and she never mentioned her again.

My husband came back and we went home. Things were finally back to normal... Lizzy never mentioned the ""girl"" again, but she came back. I will leave that for another time and another child.

Little Ghostly Anecdotes,"North Carolina, United States",A Haunted Life,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: A Haunted Life :: Little Ghostly Anecdotes

A cross my life - as well as across 2 countries, the US and Canada - I or people in my family have had some minor run-ins with what I like to think of as ghosts. I apologize for the fact I don't have one wildly interesting cohesive story, but just a scattering of things. The first is one, I didn't personally experience but my parents did. When I was four we moved into an old house in Pennsylvania that had previously been a funeral home. I'm so happy I was too young too appreciate this!

Although the house was mostly quiet, both of my parents experienced separate occurrences on our first day there. My mother at one point heard an older-sounding man talking to what seemed like a young girl on the back staircase, but there was no one there. That night my dad woke up to see a young girl walk past their bedroom door. As I said, I was 4 and my sister was 6. As this was our first night in the new house and our rooms were upstairs, Dad was worried that we would mistakenly turn the wrong way in the dark and fall down one of the two staircases, so he got up and followed the girl who he thought was one of us. He said she was very young, in a white nightgown, and he walked so close behind her, he could have reached out and touched her. He followed her all the way down the hall and into the bathroom, but when he flipped on the light she was gone. He was so sure she was real, he went and checked the adjacent rooms, thinking she had somehow gotten away from him. Dad being Dad, he always found this to be amusing but was not in the least disturbed, and we never had any more experiences there.

A few years later (I was 8) we moved to Canada, about an hour outside of Vancouver, where Dad worked as a farmhand in exchange for a trailer to live in on the property. There had been several different farmhands over the years, and one had been run over in the driveway while working on his truck several years before. He had a wife and I believe a daughter at the time. The trailer was fairly small - maybe 35 feet long. Dad slept on a fold-out couch in the living room, my sister was in the first room, and I was in the back bedroom. One summer night around maybe 10:30 not long after everyone else had fallen asleep, I heard the screen door open. Now, we never locked the door on the porch but this thing was the loudest door on earth I think - it screeched when it was opened and slammed shut as soon as it was let go. Dad, who was the sort to wake up if you tip-toed out and just stood quietly near his bed, was of course on the couch, and the living room and porch were adjacent.

So I waited for him to jump up, but no. Then I heard very distinct foot steps come plodding through the house. The sound made me think very much of work boots - and like the person wasn't trying to be quiet, just walking through like they owned the place. I was entirely freaked out at this point, hardly even breathing curled up under my covers. I listened as the foot steps walked from the porch to the mudroom, across the edge of the living room carpet, onto the hardwood kitchen floor and across. At the end of the kitchen was our refrigerator to the right of where the hallway to the rooms began and to the left was an old wood stove. Dad had put foil on the side of the fridge to help reflect heat and I heard it ripple as if someone was walking past. The footsteps stopped right at the entrance to my sister's room, and that was it.

I heard that exact sequence repeat 2 more times across the few years we lived there, I believe about once a year, always in the summer. After the first time it didn't bother me, and in fact I found it almost comforting - I had a sense it was the old farmhand coming in at night and checking in on his family as they slept.

Here in North Carolina at my sister's house, about 10 years later, several of us who lived there had either odd experiences or feelings. The back half of the house had burned down at some point in the past and that half always just ""felt"" weird, like there were people watching you. My sister used to hear the kitchen cupboards open and close at night and her boyfriend laughed about it until he stayed over one night and heard it too.

I never did, but one day I was sitting in the living room reading a Sylvia Brown book until I got myself thoroughly creeped out. I won't say I necessarily believe she's for real or not - how do you ever really know? - but I still was worked up, so I went outside to the back porch, standing just outside the big living room window. The cordless phone was on it's charger sitting in the window sill, and as I stood with my back to it, suddenly it turned on - I don't know how to describe it exactly; it was as if it was on speakerphone (a function it didn't have) but it was just dial tone. After about 15 seconds it turned itself off. I had had enough weird feelings about the house by then, so that did it for me - though I did actually go in, pick up the phone and say ""Hello?"" (I have no idea what I was expecting, although there have been occasions all through my life when I have heard very soft voices coming from phones even when they're hung up). But since I got no response, I grabbed my stuff and fairly well ran for the door, where I stopped and said ""Look, I am moving in 2 weeks, could you PLEASE leave me alone until then?""

I never had another problem at the house, even when I moved back in several years later. However a month or so after moving, I talked to my sister and we found we had the same odd feelings in the same places in the house and on our own had taken to calling our ""roommate"" by virtually the same name - I called her Eleanor, she called her Ellen - while also having the sense there was a man as well (we believed it was her husband) that we had never seen, yet had a similar mental image of what he looked like. A later roommate also, without prodding, claimed the same areas of the house bothered him.

(On a side note, about Sylvia Brown - like I said earlier, I have no firm opinion, but it has always struck me as strange that any time I see her on TV/read her book things act up. She always makes my TV go on the fritz. Every time I've seen her the reception will either go fuzzy or lose the channel entirely and those kinds of things, along with of course the phone acting up after the book got to me.)

Lastly, (sorry this is getting long) I have what my family affectionately refers to as my Bathroom Ghost. Granted I am notoriously absent-minded, but there are times things can't be all my fault - I don't think. She (I don't know if it's female, but that's what I have always thought) has a fondness for temporarily stealing my things. And she follows me, even on vacation. My sister and I stayed with friends for a few days in Canada and upon leaving I couldn't find my brush. All of my stuff was kept in one backpack, so it's not like there was a lot of searching to be done. I went all through their house as this is a brush I've had since I was 5 and it's sentimental by now.

Finally we left, telling them to just hang onto it if they found it. We left and about an hour down the road I reached in my backpack for something and there it was, right in plain sight. This summer I got sunburned and went hunting a bottle of aloe gel that I was pretty sure was under the bathroom sink. I live alone now in a small trailer and the cabinet under the sink is maybe one and a half square feet, and not all that crammed - plus this stuff is almost fluorescent green and hard to miss. I drug everything out but couldn't find it.

A few weeks later while getting out some liquid soap to refill the dispenser... There it was. I don't recall any times other stuff in other parts of the house have gone missing, but maybe a few times a year random items - cough syrup, tweezers, etc - will disappear for a short period of time. Although somewhat annoying, it makes me laugh. I've wondered if maybe she's what people call my ""guide"" and just likes to say hi from time to time.

Well, I think that's finally about it. Any thoughts on cross-country bathroom thieves or anything else?

My Friend's Haunted House,"Arizona, United States",Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: My Friend's Haunted House

I have this friend, he has been using drugs for a good portion of his life. He has done so much drugs that he believed he worshipped satan. Well, he has lived in about 4 houses in the past 3 years, and each house was ""haunted"". I had heard stories from some people that have been to either of his houses, but I didn't believe it. I haven't been to any of his homes except for the most recent one.

It was about 2:00 am when we were looking for him. We went to his house, he was moving out of it so we weren't sure if he was there or not. We pulled up and it was dark, no lights were on. But we wanted to check anyways. Me and one of my friends stood on the driveway and the other 2 friends I was with went to the front door. They knocked and no one answered, then they noticed the door was unlocked so they opened it and went inside.

They realized no one was inside, so they started walking back out. As soon as they shut the door behind them, the garage light turned on. We told them and they went back in the house and into the garage, no one was there. We were really confused by this point. Then once again they came back outside and shut the door, only this time as soon as they shut the door, the blinds right next to it opened as though someone were looking out at us. They stayed open that way and the garage light stayed on until we got in the car and started driving away.

Soon as we start driving the blinds shut and the light turns off. About 30 feet up the road there is a dark man standing on the side walk watching us drive by. My headlights went over him but he remained as dark as he first appeared. We could not see his face. After this experience, with my 4 other witnesses that saw the same thing, I believed in ghosts and demons.

The House with the Old Lady,"Michigan, United States",Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: The House with the Old Lady

W hen I was 3 years old my parents bought their first house. I'm now 37 and have a house and family of my own. The 1st encounter I can recall is when my bother was born, I was 5 at the time and we shared a bedroom. My mother had come into the room in the middle of the night to check on him and saw an elderly women standing next to the crib.

We would experience this women on many occasions after that. We did know an elderly woman was a previous owner but that was all we had. When I was 8 my parents had a large addition put onto the home. After that it wasn't only bedroom sightings but kitchen and dining room, though never anything in the new area's of the home.

Years later when I was in my early twenties my husband and son came to the home for the first time for a weeklong visit. At this point I had never told my husband about any of the sightings. One day during our visit, we left my husband at the house while everyone else went shopping. (Mind you this was the middle of the day) When we returned he was outside sitting on the porch. He took me into the bedroom were he told me what had happened.

First he explained that he was watching TV in the older part of the home and it turned off. He turned it back and it happened again. When he went to turn it on the second time, he heard something banging on the outer wall of the home next to the TV. He wrote that off as well to a possible animal. Once the TV was back on, he heard what sounded like serial people walking in from the back door into the kitchen and cupboard doors opening and closing. He yelled at that point, ""you are all back already""? No one answered and everything went quiet. By this point he had had enough and went outside to wait for our return.

I sat him down and told him of the activity in the home and also told him I would be waking him up in the middle of the night. When this happened to looking in a certain corner of the bedroom and not say a word. A couple of nights later I woke him up, he did as I had told him. After a couple of moments she was gone. I told him I would describe what he had seen. A women in her 70's, about 4""7, a dark night gown, dark gray hair in a loose bun.

His mouth fell open. I had just described what he had seen and he was without words. Since that time many things still occur and we occasionally her story's of lamps turning on by their selves and noises.

My Sister Says Goodbye,"Virginia, United States",Family / Friends Visits,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Family / Friends Visits :: My Sister Says Goodbye

O n October 9th 2007, our family held the funeral of my sister Noy. After the regular prayer, the buddhist ceremony followed and just a handfull of people left. I was amazed by the amount of people that wanted to stay for this ceremony. I'm not sure if any of you understand or have any knowledge of buddhism. Well, my family is buddhist but of course we are open to other religions.

My mother is very close to the Laos temple in Catlett VA (wat laos, buddavong). There were live monks at the funeral and they chanted. They lined up each family member in front of the casket and each of us had a monk's robe in our hands. In the robe there were flowers, candles, our name, and cash. We laid them on top of my sister because she was going to be cremated with it. The meaning of these items is to provide her with them for her journey. Once the strings and flowers are cut away, it is releasing her spirits and allowing her to go. After the ceremony, the monks followed my parents to their house, along with our friends and other family members. I followed my oldest sister and her friends to her house because we also had people over.

That night I had the most sad, scary, yet vivid dream! This is the first time Noy's face appeared since she passed away on October 4th. In my dream she had blonde hair with red streaks! I couldn't figure out why. Well, Noy and I were at my parents house and she was packing all of her things. I asked her where she was going. She said ""I'm moving out Joy, I found a really nice barn/garage apartment right behind mom and dad's work. It is perfect because I can display all of my art work like my own little gallery, and it will only cost me pennies"". I said ""pennies, wow that is cheap""? I cried when she grabbed her things. She told me she loved me and that everything will be ok. Then she disappeared.

The next morning we had a family gathering at my parents house. It was just the family this time. For a whole week before her funeral, my parents had all of their friends, our family members, and monks to have private prayers for Noy. When I arrived at their house, I noticed a bunch of white string covering the whole house and around the backyard. While we were eating outside, I told my family about the dream I had. My sister Janet told me that Noy had blonde hair with red streaks because her best friend Masha has that same hair color. My mom said the reason why Noy was moving out in my dream is because her spirit is no longer allowed to return to the house. This is why the strings were covering the house and yard. It is to keep her away and remind her that she has to go on with her journey. I didn't even have to ask anyone about the pennies. I then remembered the monks putting aluminum foiled pennies inside her box before we cremated her.

I have attached a youtube slide to add to this posting. This slide contains my sister's artwork. Her artwork shows how spiritual she was. I would like to share her gift with everyone.

The Bachelor Suite,"North Carolina, United States",Apparitions / Voices / Touches,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Apparitions / Voices / Touches :: The Bachelor Suite

A couple years ago I worked briefly at a local bed and breakfast. The Inn was an old mansion from back around the time the town was first settled. The place was of course creepy just in that it was so old, and had too many little nooks and corners. There were the old passageways for the maids to get to the rooms without going through the main halls, but I was never brave enough to go down them - the cellar was enough of a stretch for me.

While I worked there I was dating the manager, and one night we decided to stay at the Inn. We had few guests at any time, and on this night the place was empty. There was a reservation in place, but they hadn't shown up yet to claim their room by the time we retired for the night, so we just left a note on the door telling them where their room was. We stayed in Room 2, which was on the second floor at the end of the hallway, across from the Bachelor Suite. A couple of the rooms were named suites as they were especially ornate and larger than the regular rooms. The Bachelor Suite hadn't been rented out yet while I had been there as it had been undergoing some renovations that were basically done by this point.

We went to bed probably a bit after 11 but woke up within a couple hours to what sounded like at least two people coming down the hall with their luggage (our door was closed of course). We both sat up a little and listened to them pause outside the Bachelor Suite and open the door and go in. Once things had quieted down and it seemed that the guests were settled in and all was well we went back to sleep, not wanting to disturb them after their trip and late arrival.

The next morning we got up early to prepare the breakfast only to find everything as we had left it downstairs and no guests to feed, nor any trace that anyone had ever been in that room at all.

Curtains to Kill For,Mexico,Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: Curtains to Kill For

T his took place in Tijuana, Mexico. When I was a baby, my mom and dad shared a house with my aunt because it was located in a kind of dangerous neighborhood for young people to live by themselves. They sticked with this house, however, because it was not an ugly house at all. Its decoration was very nice, my mom said it looked like the previous owners put a lot of effort and money to make it a great place to live. My mom felt a strange vibe, though, but she did not say anything because they often had family and friends visit and she didn't want to scare them off.

After settling in the house and having everything in its place, my mom finally had the time to check every detail of the decoration. She soon realized that what looked like trees and flowers on the walls were really silhouettes of people making out or involved in other sexual activities. She didn't tell my dad or aunt because probably they were going to make fun of it, but then it slipped out in a conversation and they told her she was not wrong.

After a few weeks, my other aunts started asking my mom if she could visit them instead of having them come because they felt something was going on in the house. My mom agreed, she knew they were right. One day while cleaning the house, my dad hit the wall and it felt like there was an empty space behind. He started ripping off the wallpaper and they found a small door. They opened it the next morning because it was almost night time and my mom was afraid of what could be inside it.

The next morning they opened the door and there was a small closet, they did not find a dead body, a hidden treasure or something that made him rich, no. They found night gowns, old make-up, slippers, fantasy jewelry and other stuff. That's when it hit them, the house we were occupying was an ""entertainment house"" in the past. And even though this did not disturb them, they decided to move out after an evening when something scary happened. My mom got home and put me in my crib, she was tucking me in when she heard my aunt say ""Diana, llegaste?"" (meaning ""Diana, you're home?) My mom replied and when she went to my aunt's room there was nobody there, she picked me up and waited for my aunt or dad to get home in the living room with the door opened and turned every light in the house on.

After moving out, they were curious and did a little research. They found out that the house was previously owned by an old lady who ran a prostitution business. She hired someone to install a new set of curtains and when they were ready, the employees stabbed the lady and stashed her body in the basement. The rumor was that she had a chest full of money and her killers went after it. Her body was found by a prostitute who was the first one for 'work', according to the information given to my folks. The girl found the house completely trashed and not being able to find the lady in any of the rooms she went to the basement, that's when she made the gruesome discovery.

All this information was given to my parents by a neighbor, the old man told them he was close friends with the murdered lady (I personally think they also sustained a business relationship).

Time is Falling Away,"Washington, United States",Poltergeists / Physical Manifestations,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Poltergeists / Physical Manifestations :: Time is Falling Away

T his is yet another story relating to my first one . This happened when I was about 16. There is a clock in the kitchen above the sink, and is dead center on the back wall of the kitchen. The clock has a glass door covering the face that has a latch to keep it closed. Every member of my family had experiences where the door to the face of the clock would open on its own.

My younger sister (who was never bothered by this spirit) was actually doing the dishes one evening and witnessed the door opening right before her eyes. This being her first real experience freaked her out so bad that she could not finish the dishes and refused to go back into the kitchen for the rest of the night. This had been happening for quite some time, yet I was the only one who never saw this happen.

Finally one evening I was sitting in the dinning area to the right of the kitchen, ironically coloring a picture of the lady and death in this medieval coloring book I had. I remember glancing up at the clock and thinking, with all the other things that had been happening to me, why hadn't I seen the door open? I finished my coloring, and got up to go to my bedroom. As soon as I set foot into the kitchen I just happened to look up at the clock. Right as it was torn off the wall before my eyes. It came down forcefully with a loud crash, falling flat on its bottom and into the dish rack, flinging forks and knives across the kitchen which landed at my feet. As this happened I swear I heard a faint growl, and felt a huge burst of angry energy forced in my direction. I was so scared I wanted to run out of the house and halfway up the block. Instead I ran into the couch in the living room and fell on my older sister's lap.

She asked me ""what the hell did you do!?"" and I tried to explain to her that I didn't do anything. She tried to tell me that I needed to go clean up my mess, but I was too afraid to go back into the kitchen and kept repeating that I didn't do it! A couple of hours later when my dad got home, I explained what had happened. He went into the kitchen and retrieved the clock that was still sitting on the back of the sink. As he examined it, we noticed that the nails that held the clock in place on the wall were still in tact, but they were bent downward. There were also grooves in the wood on the back of the clock from the nails. He commented how it really did look like someone just came up and ripped it off the wall. The clock was very secure on the wall and it would have taken an earthquake to make it fall in the first place.

My dad permanently glued the door shut so it could not be opened, and replaced the nails on the wall. We made sure that It was VERY secure this time. He claimed later on that he was up late one evening and he could hear the door jiggling, like someone was trying to open it again.

I have not witnessed any other encounters with the clock in the kitchen though it still gives me an eerie feeling when I go in there. Other clocks in the house, such as the alarm clocks would sound off on their own. In the middle of the day, or sometimes even in the evening while the whole family was eating at the dinner table. Time seems important to this being and I am trying to figure out what it all means.

My Son's Friend,"Massachusetts, United States",Children Who See Spirits,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Children Who See Spirits :: My Son's Friend

I t seems that sensitivity runs in the family. I have always felt presences and even had some experiences, but I'll save some of those for another time. This is about my son's experience with a spirit.

We moved into our home about a year ago, and everything seemed quiet. I sensed something was there but not in a harmful way. Well one night about three weeks ago I was walking through our house just making sure all the lights were off before going to bed myself, as I was approaching my son's room I could hear him talking to someone. He was actually holding a conversations with someone. I asked him who he was talking to, he replied my new friend, so I asked about his new friend. He told me his friend's name was John and that he used to live here before we moved in. I said ok and told him to get some sleep. I went to my room and asked my fiancee if he ever told our son the name of the gentleman that lived here before we did. He said ""no, why?"" so I told him what happened. You see John was the name of the man that lived in the house for a long time and passed away in the bathroom a little over two years ago. And we live across the street from the cemetery where he was buried.

I thought this was so cool. I had to share it with you. And I would be more then happy for some input.

Uncle's Call,"New Jersey, United States",Family / Friends Visits,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Family / Friends Visits :: Uncle's Call

M y uncle was one of my best babysitter's as I grew older and older. Me and my cousin Georgette grew fond of him and even when we had friends over, we enjoyed his company. Uncle Lopez had always bought me clothes, jewelry, and gave me money when I didn't need it. We lived in a two family house: our family on the bottom, and him on the top. Our house was being sold so we both had to take our separate ways. Since then, I thought I would never see him again.

He had moved to Las Vegas with my cousins because him and my father were having problems, I never knew why. The next day I had received a phone call from my aunt. My uncle Lopez has passed away and they didn't know the reason why. They had told me that he went to sleep and the next day he died, his heart wasn't beating, he was gone. I hung up, told my parents the news, and started to cry. Was he really gone?

I started having dreams about him for about a week and for some reason, they were always the same thing: We were in a mall together laughing and smiling, and he was carrying my mom's cell phone.

Month's later I hadn't been too sad as I was before about the death because truly, I had to move on. It was coming close to September so unfortunately, I had to go school shopping again. Me and my mom hit the mall to have those mother-daughter days. When we were done shopping, before we walked out the mall, her cell phone rang. When I looked at the screen it said ""Uncle Lopez"" I was confused and I told my mom, ""Didn't auntie throw uncle Lopez's cell phone away?"" She nodded and I saw my mom wasn't the only one frightened. She told me to call back and as I dialed his numbers, my fingers were shaking with fear. When I called someone picked up, and all I heard were the noises of static and a bit of a voice, I just couldn't understand what he was saying.

Finally, I noticed that me, in a mall, with my mother's cell phone, reminded me of my dream.

My Boyfriend's Basement,"Illinois, United States",Old Hags / Night Attacks / Sleep Paralysis,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Old Hags / Night Attacks / Sleep Paralysis :: My Boyfriend's Basement

M y boyfriend lives in the basement of his grandparents house. They would always tell me stories of a ghost down there. It always included someone yelling their name and when they went to check out who it was, no one would be around. I never experienced any of this the numerous times I had stayed there.

About two weeks ago, I came home from school to visit him. He gets up for work every morning at 3:45 and leaves around 5:15. Normally I will just sleep in and go home later in the morning. One morning around 5:30 after he left, I laid in bed and fell back asleep. I was awoken and was being shook. It felt as though someone had a hold of me and was shaking me. I could not move, I just laid there and I felt this weird presence over me.

Then I looked to my right to the side of the bed and there was this thing I felt standing there. All I could see was two blurry white shapes as if they were eyes. I just starred and I couldn't move. I just kept telling myself that it was all a dream and nothing was happening and then once I was able to look away, everything let go. I freaked out and tried to go back to bed, after being unsuccessful, I went home. I have never slept alone in that basement since.

Am I crazy? I asked his whole family about what they had experienced in the past and if this was in any way related, they all thought I was dreaming and said never before had anything like that happened. It felt very mean to me, like it wanted me out of the bed, like it didn't want me there. It just has this mean stare, that is like infused in my brain.

After that my boyfriend Mike says that more weird things have been happening to him. Lately he said that he will throw his comforter on the ground in the morning before he leaves for work and when he gets back, his bed is made. He has asked his family members if they have been doing this and everyone says no.

What is going on in this basement? His grandparents were the first ones to live in this house, they have lived there for about 40 years and things always happen in the basement. They live in Rock Falls Illinois.

Unwanted Presence,"New Jersey, United States",Old Hags / Night Attacks / Sleep Paralysis,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Old Hags / Night Attacks / Sleep Paralysis :: Unwanted Presence

I t was late at night when it happened to me. I was freakishly terrified. It was a long day and I was tired. My sister had turned off the lights and went in bed, we share a bed so I slept next to her. For some reason, I couldn't go to sleep. Yeah, I'm afraid of the dark... I put the covers over me even though it was burning hot, my heart was racing, I didn't want to hear anything creepy nor see anything.

I kept quiet, I just laid there. I couldn't take it no more and so I started to turn on my other side. Until, I paused. I couldn't move, or say anything. I gasped for breath and tried to move my feet and fingers. I was completely paralyzed, I opened my eyes and saw this huge black figure standing before me, I blinked a couple of times so I couldn't really make out the details. I opened my mouth, but nothing came out. I tightly closed my eyes as cold chills went down my spine. I could feel it, tears coming out of my eyes. I was so scared, I didn't know what to do. But then I quickly turned almost smacking my arm on my sister but luckily I stopped in time. I looked over to see the figure had turned a pupleish blueish and it disappeared. I wiped my tears, and woke up my sister.

Believe it or not, but this is based on something that did happen. I don't know for sure, but I believe it was trying to MAKE me go to sleep.

"The Black Man in Little Falls and Old Lady in Ilion, NY","New York, United States",Children Who See Spirits,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Children Who See Spirits :: The Black Man in Little Falls and Old Lady in Ilion, NY

W hen I was little (around 2 or so and still small enough to be in a crib) my mother and I lived in an apartment in a house that had been converted to a four family home. This house was on Church Street in the small ""city"" of Little Falls. I used to tell my mother ""the black man"" was there to see me. Little Falls is a very small community and in the early 70s there were no ""black"" people there. I had never seen a black person in my life.

Despite the fact I was so young, I can still see this man in my mind and on a recent occasion spoke of this with my mother and fully detailed the layout of the apartment to her. We only lived there about 6 months. The day we moved out, my mother found a crucifix on the book case. She had never owned one and there was no excuse for it to be there. Years later we learned the house had a history of being an ""underground railroad"" in the 1800s.

Several years later when my son was about the same age I was with my ""black man"" experiences, he began to talk about the ""black man"" who would come to see him. He, also, had never seen a black person in his life. I wonder if it was the same ""black man"" or just a coincidence.

My son also claimed to see an ""old lady"" going up the stairs in a home we bought around the time he was 12 years old. Six months later we discovered the ""old lady"" who owned the house, two owners prior to us had died in the house and lied there for three days dead before being discovered.

Occasionally, I would hear little noises that could only be described as tiny sneezes when no-one else was in the room. The house was very old and my husband and I were trying to restore it. Whenever a man (other than my husband) would try to do repairs at the house, he would end up getting hurt. My husband and sons were the only males who could work on the house without getting hurt. It was at that point we decided to do all the work ourselves.

My son never saw the lady again and I never heard the sneezes again after that. She must have been happy with our work.

Oh Grandma,"New Jersey, United States",Family / Friends Visits,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Family / Friends Visits :: Oh Grandma

A listina Bautista, that was my grandmothers' beautiful name. She was someone who I really looked up to, even today. She made me realize many things, like learning from my own mistakes, and standing up for myself. She was an outgoing and encouraging women. Many on my relatives loved her, even though I believed I wasn't her all-time favorite, she was a sweet hearted women with a warm smile, and courageous soul.

I was about eleven years old when I started having this awkward dream about my grandmother, almost feeling very real. It was very late on April 10th and I was lying into a mattress with no sheets and covers because my family had just moved in. My dream had took place in a cemetery on a warm, sunny afternoon. I appeared in the middle of nowhere in that cemetery and from my point of view, I saw my grandmother sitting on a gray fancy looking bench smiling.

She asked me to take a seat right beside her and so I did. She was wearing a white dressed mixed with a bit of yellow, it was beautiful, she looked beautiful. Her hair was down and wavy, she was wearing blush, a very red lip-stick, and on her ring finger, the ring my grandfather had given her for their wedding.

I felt a bit of soothing emotion in me and my eyes began to blur.

""Oh grandma! I promise you with all my heart I'll never forget you, I won't!""

The weather suddenly began changing. Clouds stated to form over the blazing hot sun and my grandmother was disappearing before my eyes. Her body began to float above me and then even higher to the skies.

She disappeared within a blink of an eye, and I woke up. The next day, when I finally awoke, my mother announced that my grandmother had passed away not took long ago.

It was April 11th the day of her funeral and she had passed away at exactly 8 a.m. I was crying, especially my mother, the daughter of Alistina. She was truly gone and it was so difficult to believe. As I arrived closer to her coffin, I froze in a bit of terror. She was wearing the exact same dress in my dream... The same wavy hair... The very red lip-stick, and my grandfather's ring on her ring finger.

Ever since that night of my dream, I believed that my grandmother was trying to contact me, and wishing me the best before she died. Sill, I miss her today, aiming for the stars to finally see her again.

The Haunted Book Shelf,"North Carolina, United States",Poltergeists / Physical Manifestations,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Poltergeists / Physical Manifestations :: The Haunted Book Shelf

W e just moved to north carolina and the house me and my family moved into was built back in the early 1960's. It was back in the woods where a battlefield used to be and also a graveyard. I was about 9 at the time. There was this old fireplace in the living room and beside it was a old built-in book shelf with attached books that pulled open into a hide-a-way room, like a panic room.

Me and my family were watching a movie one saturday night in the living room, but we still had 1 lamp on so we could still see each other. We heard a squeak and the room from the bookshelf was exposed. I got so scared, my mom told me that it was probably open and my dog pushed it open even more.

Getting ready for school on sunday, me and my mother were watching tv around 7 o'clock and one of the books from the bookshelf came flying across the living room in mid-air, hit the wall and dropped. I about peed in my pants. We don't know what happened and ever since then, weird things were happening around that house.

One night, we had those shades that when you pull them, they roll up because we were in the process of ordering new ones. One night, in my room while I was asleep, they suddenly popped up. I was taking a bath and I always shut the door but when I was drying off, I saw it was locked, which I didn't do. I got locked in the bathroom and we had to call the landlord because my parents couldn't get me out.

I am 16 now and I believe in ghosts, weird things happen to me and I see things. But thank god we moved... into a brand new house!

What is Following Us?,"Indiana, United States",Psychic / Medium,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Psychic / Medium :: What is Following Us?

I actually started to ""feel"" things in my preteens. I became the ""Ghost Hunter"" of the family and the butt of many a joke, so to be utterly honest, I smothered this ""talent"" so that at every family gathering, there were no new stories for the family to harass me about. Most of my young experiences I have completely forgotten, one or two stick out in my memory but otherwise I became a ""normal"" teen in the eyes of my extended family.

Now my teenage daughter has become a sort of magnet. I find this a bit disturbing as we also have a four year old who appears to have a firm grasp on things that have happened before, almost as if from another existence. He can give, in a four year old way of doing things, time lines and such and has even warned us on occasion of things to come. Either that or he is one of the worlds leading child storytellers.

Nine years ago, when our daughter was six, we lived in a mobile home park in Goshen, Indiana, USA. The houses were rather close together, so much of the audio phenomenon we have discounted as to the proximity. In the middle of the night running footsteps could be heard running down the hall, only in one direction, towards the master bedroom. While taking a bath in the garden tub (Master bath off of the Master bedroom) I would have to cover the eight mirrors that were above the his and hers sinks and counter top, walls and even the glass in the door so that my daughter could actually play in the tub. If the double glass doors (pretty heavy for a mobile home) were left open they would have to be closed or she just was not comfortable in the room.

Our daughters bedroom was in the front of the house with her window facing out into the street. The neighborhood was quiet and for the most part trustworthy, yet she felt the need to cover up her window. She had a walk in closet with sliding doors that would lift off of the track in the middle of the night. Her bathroom had an adjoining wall to that room and was decorated very much like a little girl would dream of a perfect bath, but she could not walk into it alone. We initially thought it was because the front door of the home was directly across from it. In fact, if someone was coming in the front door, and someone was coming out of that bath, the doors would hit if they were not opened cautiously.

Eventually she opted to stop sleeping in that room. She could not give us a concrete reason for her not wanting to stay in there, she could only tell us that it was a dark, cold room and it made her sad. If she would have a friend over, she would not take them into the room for more than a few minutes to choose toys, then they would be out and playing in the living room.

My husband decided that we needed to move. A new baby was on the way and our daughters discomfort was a bit much for a Daddy to handle, I think. Approximately a week before we were to move into a three story house in a different city about seventeen miles away, we were lying on the bed of the Master bedroom explaining to our daughter all of the new changes she was going to have to deal with.

There was a new school, friends, neighbors, practically a new life for a nine year old. We were just talking and looking at the ceiling fan, assuring her that we would not change, just circumstances, when the fan began to spin slowly. We checked the wall switch and the pull cord and both were in the off position. There was no breeze going through the house at the time and the three of us were the only ones visibly present.

We moved to Elkhart, Indiana, USA. Things went smoothly for a while and it appeared as if our daughter was adjusting quite nicely to her new life and circle of friends. Our bedrooms were upstairs, ours at the head, our daughter across the hall and our son was at the end of the hall farthest from the stairs. Our daughter woke us up late one night and described hearing gunshots or the backfiring of a car coming from her closet. She had a walk in, fifteen by eighty foot closet that had been used as attic space by previous tenants and as we moved in while the reconstruction was in full swing, we attributed the sounds to echoes from the road bouncing off her almost empty closet as she did not have enough clothes to fill the space and the carpeting had yet to be laid.

Her room was always the coldest in the home. We gave her space heaters, electric blankets, put heaters in the hall, cranked the thermostat up during the day thinking it would warm it up. We had the furnace serviced and left all the doors opened to maximize heat flow through the house. Our son's room shared one of the walls of our daughter's closet. His door began to slowly shut itself. I could never see anything behind the door, but it felt as if someone was holding the door and closing it while watching the stairs, almost as a child would if sent to their room and told that someone would be up in a few minutes to talk to them. This was a feat in itself as the carpeting was quite plush and it took a bit of muscle to shut it. As our son was still in the infant years he was still sleeping in our room and not yet his own.

Our daughter welcomed a new friend in her life that we never got to meet. She would sit in the closet, with the heavy metal accordion style doors open playing and talking for hours. In our son's room his musical toys would start playing of their own accord, Cd's and tapes would not play in that room, (radio would) but if we took the portable player into another room it worked perfectly. She had recurring stomach problems, and at school behavioral problems were beginning to occur after choosing this room.

While walking down the stairs to get ready for school one morning she fell down ten of the steps, picked herself up on the landing and promptly fell down the remaining four steps. When questioned she said she felt dizzy and just lost her balance. Twice. My husband (270 lbs, 5'11"", body build of a wrestler) was shoved UP the stairs and on another occasion someone actually left a hand mark on his ankle when they grabbed it as he ran up the stairs to quickly check on something. We found him laying on the carpet as if asleep.

Friends who stayed the night in the bedroom in the basement (direct line under the bathroom and our daughters closet space) claimed to have their toes gently played with, they have heard breathing when no one was there, someone sat on the bed with one of our male guests and a rustle as if of fabric was heard. A friend who stayed in our daughter's room while she was away for the weekend became quickly and violently ill and could not make it out of the bed in time to be sick. She remained quite ill until we moved her into another room on the ground floor of the house where all of her symptoms just stopped.

I was getting ready for work one day and I finished the shower, came out and briefly spoke to my daughter before she headed off to school and returned to the bathroom. My husband was a stay at home Dad at the time. I got a bit dizzy, almost as if you stand up too quickly and woke up to my son crying and my husband on the phone explaining that they just found me on the floor. No medical reasons for any of us to be passing out.

I asked a lady at work about House Blessings as I knew that both her husband and herself are Healers. With two of her associates, we sent the menfolk outside for a while and blessed the entire house with our daughter in attendance. She complained of feeling uneasy and said that the whole thing was creepy.

A few days later I was told to watch her for signs of possession. Maybe it wasn't the house, maybe it was actually my child. So I enrolled her in out patient therapy with a psychologist nearby who was known for dealing with the ""unknown"". The results were not what we expected. If anything we had an increase of activity, and no instructions on how to deal with them, so after three years of therapy I took her out.

Two years ago we moved about four miles away for reasons totally not related to the activities in that house. We now live right on Main Street and we are having just about the same types of experiences in this home. An insurance man came into the house and asked who lived in the attic. (No one, it is an unfinished room that does not yet even have a full length floor installed.) The door opens on its own and there is a hook lock on it.

A friend was visiting with her one year old and she will not return. The baby came in and toddled past the attic door and played at a little desk we have set up. Within moments the child became ill and threw up. We took her outside to play and she was fine. We came in to get a bite to eat. She wanted to sit at the desk and that is where she ate. Afterwards she started playing again and got ill. No fever, no new foods or drink, there was no known explanation for her illness.

We get phone calls at all hours of the day and night where no one is on the other side. One of the bedroom doors opens when no one is around. Music is heard in one corner of the living room where there is no radio and no speakers, we put things away for a time and find them in a place we wouldn't store them, toys still go off. The alcove inside the front door is our computer room and it is always the coldest room in the house. We have plexiglass up on the outsides of our windows, yet to be comfortable in there we have to run a space heater.

I am lost. I used to explain things away by saying it was just the ghost of the house, but IF it is my daughters energy how do I fix that? She's fifteen now, if she is a magnet or whatever, I need to know how to help her deal with whatever is going on. I closed it all off at an early age, so I am afraid I have no way of showing her the ropes. If it is a ghost following us, or different entities, what do I do to put them at ease? When we move again, what is to say that these occurrences won't happen again?

The People in the Mirror,"California, United States",Photographs / Videos / EVP,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Photographs / Videos / EVP :: The People in the Mirror

T his story is the reason behind our name People in The Mirror. About two weeks ago in the new house I'm living in, in Temecula with my family, my 2 kids were asleep, my husband was at work, and my brother was at his Homecoming dance. I was, like I am right now, in my brother's room on the computer when I heard really loud heavy footsteps coming up the stairs and when they got to the top of the stairs I heard a slap, as if someone slapped their hand hard on the top of the banister.

I thought it was my Dad, it sounded as though he was mad, so I got up quickly to check and see what was wrong. When I went out into the hallway no one was there, so I looked in my Dad's room to find he wasn't there either. I looked through the banister downstairs where I could see my Dad passed out on the couch, so I checked on my kids and they were asleep as well. I searched the entire house and nobody had come home.

A week later I was talking to my friend Nicole, who is more like a sister, and I told her what had happened. She got pale and looked at me and told me that just a few days before when she was over, she was sitting on my bed and heard someone coming up the stairs. You can see the top of the stairs from my bed and she said she looked over, expecting to see me at the top of the stairs, only no one was there, a few seconds later she saw me coming up the stairs with a big basket of laundry and holding my 1 year old son's hand helping him up the stairs.... There was no way to explain the previous footsteps as I was walking up the stairs very slowly and the footsteps she heard were fast and yet no one was there. That got us talking about the experiences we both had in the Chula Vista house and realizing the only thing that connects the experiences now to the ones back then was the mirror.

We decided to go through some old pictures that were taken while I lived in the Chula Vista house. While going through the pictures we expected to find nothing, however that definitely wasn't the case. We found more than a few pictures that had what people call orbs, a couple photos that looks almost like a cord got in the way, but it was a disposable camera so there was no cord. There were 4 pictures that have the mirror in it, one picture we are writing off as streaks in the mirror... although you can make out faces in it... But the most shocking are the other three. One was taken at Christmas time; it looks as though there is a white faced, almost skull like, dark hooded thing in the mirror. There is no way anyone could have been standing there as with the lay out of the house and where the tree was placed they would have to have been standing on presents. We also would have been able to see more or their body because the wall was right there. The other two were taken at my baby shower when I was pregnant with my now 6 year old daughter. My husband and I were sitting in between the TV and fireplace, the fireplace that the mirror hung above. In the pictures we were opening gifts, and these two pictures were taken probably about 5 minutes apart, at slightly different angles.

Nicole was flipping through that set of pictures when she said, ""oh hell no, tell me you don't see that."" She handed me the album and was pointing out something she said looked like a face peering out the mirror. I looked and honestly only saw a reflection of a flash. She was saying over and over that the same face was in these two pictures and was completely freaked out by it.

The next day we took all the pictures down to Wal-Mart and had them scanned and put on disk to load them on the computer. Once I got home we loaded them onto the computer and while looking at these two zoomed in and sure enough clear as day I saw the face. While looking at these photos I was remembering back to that day while setting things up and cleaning a bit before the shower I was cleaning the mirror with windex and a paper towel. There was one area that seemed streaky to me on the right side of the mirror but no matter how much windex and rubbing I did it wouldn't come off and while I was trying to remove the streaks, I saw a face in the streaks. It creeped me out a little bit but it didn't scare me too much as I just told myself it was streaks and then they started to go away.

Now normally I would write the picture off to streaks, but the face of the man we see is in the bottom left side of the mirror and the pictures were taken at different angles and yet the face is still exactly the same. I can understand seeing a face in one, but at different angles there shouldn't be the same in the other picture.

I am posting the pictures with this story and feel free to find a logical explanation for them, that is the whole reason we are doing this, we are starting to research the Chula Vista house, the mirror and the land where the Chula Vista house was so anything you can do to disprove them or let us know anything you know about these things would be very helpful.

Many people are having trouble seeing what is in the mirror. I went to paint and outlined what I see. I'm not very good at that so it is not perfect, sorry. I am sending three pictures that I outlined. The picture where I am holding the blanket, there is a man looking out of the mirror. The other picture where I have my head turned the same man is peering out of the mirror. Both pictures were taken at slightly different angels. We had different gift in our hands so the pictures were taken at different times. So I don't see how I can see the same face in both pictures. My friend Nicole saw it first. In order for me to see it, at first, I had to zoom in on it. Now that I have seen the face, I can see it every time, no matter how big the picture is.

I showed them to everyone I know and they all see the same face. The third picture is the one that I can see a white face with a black hood. I was Christmas time so there was no one that would have been dressed up like that. Also you can see through it a little. If it were actually somebody you wouldn't be able to see through it. I hope you all can see the same thing so you know what I am talking about. If you see it I hope you will tell me what you think.

Sacramento Theater Company: Meet Pinky the Ghost!,"California, United States",Ghost Hunting,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Ghost Hunting :: Sacramento Theater Company: Meet Pinky the Ghost!

L et's go to downtown Sacramento and stop at a building that is 66 years old. That building is The Sacramento Theater Company on 1419 H Street, Sacramento. The place has a reputation. It's reputed to be very haunted. On October 23, 2007, Tuesday, I meet up with HPI paranormal investigators: Shannon 'Ms. Macabre' McCabe - President; Tim Hawkins - Lead Investigator; Chris Grissom - Scout/Technician; Michele Stump - Researcher/Scout; Donna Reynolds, Cherie Vincent - Scout. We set up equipment at 5:30pm, we will be here until 10pm. I am introduced to Marketing Director/Sensitive Kim Kaplan and Costume Shop Manager Jessica Minnihan. Two very lovely ladies that have stories to tell. Kim has only been here for one month and strange things started happening to her. The cabinet in her office fell down by itself and another time, the pipes fell from the roof. Jessica has experienced very strange things too, such as in the upstairs costume shop, the lights went off by itself. In the backstage corridor, she has heard heavy breathing and footsteps, she continued walking and then she heard someone whisper her name, she turned around to sucker punch her stalker and there was no one there. At times spools of thread fly off the shelves on their own. She has no explanation for these strange occurrences, except that perhaps this place is truly haunted.

Pinky: Resides in costume shop, some people think she was once the manager of this establishment. There is controversy on her gender, some people think she is female, others think male. Since Jessica says that she emits a pink orb, I would go with female. Pinky likes to play with buttons on costumes and plays with the lights. She can be found throughout the theater, she likes to play pranks. Pinky once saved a technician from a falling lightbar and pulled him away to safety. Pinky is a heroine!

Two Hungarian Lovers: They fell in love in this theater, were once separated and reunited in this theater and now they remain here after death.

Louie The Stagehand: I will call this entity Louie, because I heard the same story that Jessica told back in the 70s and the people who told me, said the man is named Louie. Louie supposingly fell to his death from the grid or rafters or maybe even the catwalk. No one is really sure. Louie was possibly an actor too.

The Ghostly Opera Singer: Sometimes people can hear her sing in the theater. Some actors and actresses make claim to see ghostly apparitions in their mirrors, when they are getting ready for a play.

The Sound Theater Entity: Strange noises are heard, it's believed an entity is in this area.

Kaplan's Office Ghost: In Kim Kaplan's office, there is a ghost, the cause of the falling pipes and cabinet? Perhaps... Just perhaps.

Kim tells me that one stage manager doesn't want to be bothered by ghosts and will walk around the theater with her Ipod on, so she won't be bothered or needlessly frightened. On this night, we had visitors. Not ghostly visitors, but we had the media following us around. We had a representative of KFBK interviewing Shannon, Fox TV News was there and then the very colorful JayMarzz (pronounced J-Mars) and his lovely partner Michele Espo with him. They are from KBMB 103. 5 The Bomb. I let JayMarzz and Michele use my Listen Up Sound Enhancer and Michele picked up a man breathing hard and making a sighing noise, then she heard it again and it totally freaked her out and ran out screaming from the actor preparation room.

Cherie Vincent picked up a woman saying 'hi' on her electronic audio recorder. Cherie takes some orb shots throughout the theater.

Paul Dale Roberts picks up a woman sighing on his sound enhancer. I also pick up organ music that is heard by Kim Kaplan.

Kim Kaplan: Using my sound enhancer hears a man humming. With her own ears, she hears the organ music. Kim used her own dowsing rods and learns that Pinky's real name starts with a G, she is in her 20s and was once an actress. Kim's cell phone shuts off mysteriously and then starts vibrating mysteriously.

Michele Stump heard footsteps and some heavy breathing. Michele also sees a shadow figure peeking at her.

Donna Reynolds heard heavy breathing and saw a darting shadow figure.

Michele Espo hears heavy breathing and a man sighing on sound enhancer.

Shannon McCabe takes picture of JayMarzz and gets a blue mist surrounding JayMarzz. Unfortunately when we developed the photo in the computer the blue is gone... She has never seen that happen on her camera before?

Tim Hawkins, using dowsing rods, makes contact with entity named Joanne, she used to work in the wardrobe room and died in 1963.

This was a very eventful night and this place is definitely haunted. Let's see what

SHANNON'S FINDINGS AND CONCLUSION: I'd give this place a 7.5 on the ""spook meter"", we definately had a lot of distraction with all the interviewing going on and this place warrents another investigation. We are going to be allowed to take our entire core group back and do an overnighter. Thank you to all the media that showed up, Fox 40, KFBK, and KBMB. What a great night!

Stay tuned for our follow up story on the Sacramento Theater Company!

Now before I close this story, let me tell you one more story. This is a story that happened at a private residence and this is the follow-up, so let's step into a time machine and go back in time. The date is October 10, 2007, Wednesday:

Before heading out for a follow-up investigation at the Oak Park residence, I stopped over at Sacramento Access TV, 4623 T Street, Suite A to do a taping with Nancy Bradley - Psychic to the Stars! Catherine Noble, Nancy's assistant was getting everything set up for us. I met up with Paranormal Investigator/Scout Chris Grissom and he shared his Jack in the Box cheese fries and chicken, because I was starving. I didn't have time to stop and eat, I had to work late and I didn't want to be late for this taping. Nancy Bradley is one of the sweetest ladies I know and Chris and I, felt humbled and honored to be her guests. We talked about the upcoming Ghost Girls DVD that will be soon coming out, featuring Nancy Bradley and Shannon 'Ms. Macabre' McCabe. This DVD will show the Ghost Girls as they do their investigations and discuss various spirit activity that they have witnessed in various investigations. Nancy, Chris and I, discussed unusual ghostly phenomenon we have witnessed and experienced. Nancy's fans called in, one call after another, they were asking Nancy so many questions, it was amazing. Nancy had an answer for every caller and gave them some good insight on experiences the callers were having. If you have a chance read Gold Rush Ghosts (The Big Picture) by Nancy Bradley. Go to her website at www.nancybradley.org

Chris and I, after the taping went straight over to Oak Park. We were greeted by Shannon McCabe - President/Paranormal Investigator, Lead Investigator Tim Hawkins, Paranormal Investigator/Scout Cherie Vincent, Reporter R.V. Scheide and his photographer for the Sacramento News and Review named Larry. Cherie felt bad, because she isn't going to make it to the Mt. Shasta investigation and gave me a nice friendship card, along with a pumpkin. She said, I would never buy a pumpkin on my own. She's right.

Anyway, I took Tim over to the side and we discussed the last time he investigated this home with Paranormal Investigators Dee Pizarro and Lou Paman.

Tim a sharp minded Lead Investigator goes for thorough investigations. He uses a fine tooth comb to sift through all of the evidence he gathers to deliver exceptional findings and conclusions. Tim relates that the last time they investigated this home, they set up in the basement area and the EVPs that they gathered were of people chattering, it was very faint and almost sounded like radio waves. The video camera that was set up in the basement captured a moving speck of light. When doing a dowsing session, the dowsing session indicated that there was a 7 year old girl named Noreen that was present. She died of some illness in 1941. Dawn Parmeter, the occupant of this home stated that she checked some historical documents and found a 7 year old girl named Noreen that lived in the area.

On this night, Tim used the dowsing rods and asked if Noreen was present and the dowsing rods indicated 'yes'. He would ask questions, are you 10 years old, answer no. Are you 7 years old, answer yes. They felt many cold spots throughout the night. Tonight they captured an exceptional orb near Tim Hawkins and I will tell you later about that in this article. The first investigation there were many orbs captured by digital photography. Shannon picked up an EVP when she knocked on the wall and got back a metallic sound. Dawn and her boyfriend Martin Purtill indicated that sometimes the ceiling fan would turn on, during the time it was unplugged. It will turn on by itself for no apparent reason. Cherie used her Listen Up sound enhancer and heard someone say 'yeah'. One of the rooms, the occupants said they saw shadows darting around.

Dawn tells us that one night the front door knob was jiggling around. It kept shaking back and forth, like someone was trying to get in. Then her boyfriend showed up at the door and she thought he was making the door knob jiggle and he indicated he had nothing to do with the movement of the doorknob. Since the last time we investigated this house, Dawn said she heard someone walking around in the backyard, shuffling leaves while they walked. She also heard the jingle sound of keys and the dropping of keys. When I turned on my Listen Up sound enhancer, I thought I heard the jingle of keys for a split second, then I heard the sound of classical music. When I was yelling...""is there anyone here?"" The answer came back...""I'm here..."" I learned later that Chris used 5 words in a sentence with 'here' as the last word. It could have been Chris' voice, but I am not sure. Cherie took a picture of Tim and a brilliant orb came out in the picture. As we enlarged the photograph, the orb seems to have a face in it. You can see what looks like eyes and a nose. From a distance the orb looks like it has swirls.

All in all, this was an excellent investigation. Dawn must of been able to tell I was still hungry, because she showed me where she laid out an assortment of vegetables/fruit for all of us to munch on. What a hostess, she even brought me some ice cold chocolate milk. Dawn and her boyfriend Martin have been living in this house for quite sometime and they are familiar with the spirit activity and it doesn't bother them. I guess these spectres have the right to live here and they seem to cohabit with the present owners in a peaceful manner. For this investigation we used digital cameras, video cameras, electronic audio recorders, Listen Up Sound Enhancers, dowsing rods. Since it was a weeknight, we packed it in and Tim gave his debriefing outside. We all agreed that this is a house, that needs to be investigated again. Date of this investigation: October 10, 2007, Wednesday.

My sister Sharon Diane Roberts is planning to write her own ghost book and she just came out with her own book that has nothing to do with ghosts, but you may find it interesting and she asks for you to stop by her website and check it out: www.sdroberts.info

"Haunted Ghost Jail Tour, Charleston Graveyard","South Carolina, United States",Photographs / Videos / EVP,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Photographs / Videos / EVP :: Haunted Ghost Jail Tour, Charleston Graveyard

I went to South Carolina with my college roommate. We've been saving our money to go to this Haunted Ghost Jail tour, Charleston Graveyard, and their Post Office Museum. The jail tour was an old jail. You could feel something strange and cold the moment you went in. We both are ghost hunters, we exchanged true stories of past lives with orbs and spirits, we shared photos together and ever since then, we've been companion ghost hunters.

In these places, before we took photos of them, we could feel cold spots the moment we took these. Whenever our hair on the back of our neck was standing up, we took a picture wherever we felt a place that spooked us. The Graveyard in Charleston we took during day and night, and the jail photos we took late at night. We went to stay at a hotel for the first night and the next day we started the tours.

Before we took these photos, there was nothing there, the paranormal just showed up when the photos were done developing in the lab. They now are kept in a photo album book. It was strange, nothing like this happened to the pictures we took before, it's all new to us. We're beginners, you could say, with this kind of stuff.

Anybody taken photos that happened to them like these? We think the ghosts and Orbs want to be more seen nowadays. Don't know why. Right now we are learning EVP. We take a ghost class, and our class is extatic about our photos. Now everyone there believes in ghosts.

But why do ghosts show themselves on film instead of normal eyes?

She Likes to Invade Your Dreams,"Colorado, United States",Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: She Likes to Invade Your Dreams

T his happened probably about 2 1/2 or 3 years ago, but still scares me stupid every time I think about it. It's quite long because these are all events that happened in the course of about 6 months or so. It began when my boyfriend was getting ready to move out of his apartment and into a nice duplex in the downtown area. Most homes in that area are around 1950's and older, to give you an idea.

Maybe a day or two before him and his roommates moved into the place, he had a very vivid dream. He was in his current apartment and there was something haunting him and his roommate, so he decided he was going to perform an exorcism to try and get the ghost to leave. In his dream, he was sitting on his bed and doing some sort of meditation. Suddenly the ghost of a young girl appeared and started throwing things at him and yelling,

Over and over again. Behind her was a tall man hovering over her. He woke up and called me up really startled.

Awhile after they had moved into the house, things were going pretty well, aside from my boyfriend having the occasional bizarre dream, which we didn't think much about. One day we were all outside on the porch, and the neighbor from the connecting duplex came over and started describing this dream he had that was really weird. Needless to say, when we heard how similar it was to the one's my boyfriend was having we were all a little freaked out. The dreams went on for a really long time. Then there was weird things like lights turning on randomly, or hearing the floor boards creak when no one was walking on them, the rocking chair moving when no one was near it. Things like that. At this point we were all convinced there was something in the place, but it wasn't mean or vengeful.

I really started to get scared when I was at my house, sleeping. I was having kind of a weird dream, I sort of woke up a little and was in that state where you are almost asleep, but you can still sense things around you. It felt like someone was in my bedroom, then I felt a really heavy feeling on the top of my chest. Like someone was sitting on me almost, I could hardly breath! Then something moved my legs, forced them down on the bed. It took me a few minutes to catch my breath and jump up. I had never been so terrified. I described this to my boyfriend and he wondered if it maybe had something to do with the girl or the man hovering over her that was in his dream.

After that things started to get even creepier, I got a call from my boyfriend one night after he had gotten off work. He went home and was sitting in his room in the basement playing guitar, he heard something in the other room of the basement that startled him, but continued to play. When he heard what sounded like footsteps coming from upstairs he got really freaked out and grabbed the phone and ran outside and called me. He was standing about as far away from the house as he could while still having a connection on his land line phone. We talked for quite sometime, and a little while into our conversation he said that there was some sort of figure standing on his porch. The porch light was on and there was a distinct shadow in front of the door, just standing there. He waited until his roommate got home a few hours later before walking near the house again.

Not too much longer after that, I was staying at my dad's house out in the country for a couple nights. I was sleeping in his office and had a pretty vivid dream that was mostly just nonsense, but this girl kept appearing. She had long sort of bushy brown hair, glasses, and was wearing a big puffy 70's style winter coat. She kept glaring at me, and at one point it felt like someone was hovering over me as I was sleeping. I kind of jumped awake, but was more so a little startled than scared. I went right back to sleep and didn't think about it until maybe a week or so later when I was with my boyfriend. I was just casually telling him about this dream that struck me as a little weird and described the girl. He looked at me with his eyes wide open and didn't say anything for a couple minutes. My description of the girl in my dream was exactly like the girl he had seen in his first dream.

Things slowed down for awhile after that. It was probably about a month later we had a party at the house, and one of our friends ended up sleeping on the couch. One of my boyfriends roommates woke up at around 6:00 am, and she was no longer sleeping on the couch. Later on that day she called and said that at around 4:00 in the morning she heard someone walking around in the kitchen for a really long time. She ignored it and tried to go back to sleep. Just as she was about to fall back asleep she said all of the sudden, she heard footsteps running really quickly from the kitchen into the living room and stop right in front of the couch where she was sleeping. Without even thinking about it she jumped up and grabbed her things and went home at 4:30 in the morning, in the cold.

It was only a couple nights later that my boyfriend had the biggest scare. He had a very, very vivid dream. He said it was almost like a lucid dream. He was trying to get out of the house, but he was trapped. He felt something push him down, and he was stuck in the floor, half way between the basement and the first level at about his waist with something trying to push him the rest of the way down. He was struggling really hard, trying to move, to speak, to wake up. When he finally brought himself to wake up he looked over and there was a bluish, smoky looking part of a body. It was a portion of a woman's torso, he had a good look at it for about 5 seconds or so and then it dissipated into his books. He jumped up and ran up stairs as fast as he could, and banged on his roommates bedroom door. They were sitting on the couch as my boyfriend was explaining what happened, when all of the sudden the lamp turned itself on. Both of them sat up all night on the front porch afraid to go back inside.

The next day while alone in the house alone, my boyfriend started to get a little creeped out cause he said it felt like something was here with him. He calmly told it to leave him and his friends alone. There wasn't too much activity after that, we were all still a little freaked out to be in the house. One of my boyfriends roommates was native american, and his father was a medicine man, so he did a cleansing on the house, and after that nothing happened again. Before this I sort of believed in the super natural, but every time weird things would happen I'd think of a logical reason for it to happen. Or I'd think I was just going insane.

Now though, I'm almost the complete opposite, and much more aware of supernatural things happening around me.

Ouija Board and the Doll,"Idaho, United States",Ouija Board / Seances,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Ouija Board / Seances :: Ouija Board and the Doll

M e and 4 of my friends skipped school one day and went to my friend's house. We were kind of bored, so we decided to pull out the Ouija board. I had never played with one before. We went in my friend's room, and he has a blanket over his window so we thought it would be dark enough.

We started playing it and asking it questions. Once we got familiar with it we asked it do something to let us know it was in the room. It said it no and we asked why. It said, ""because the light..."" so we went into his storage closet and I found this crazy clown doll. We turned off the lights and tried again. I put the doll on his heater. His storage closet didn't have any windows so it was way dark. This time we got a different spirit and asked it some questions, like how it died and how old it was when it died and what its name was and stuff like that. We put the clown on top of his heater, and asked the spirit to move the clown doll to prove it was really there. He said he would, and we all listened as hard as we could to see if it did. We didn't hear anything and it was too dark to tell, so we just kept playing it like usual.

When we turned on the lights the doll was sitting right next to me. Crazy huh?

Finally at Peace After a Long Haunted Ordeal,"Ohio, United States",Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: Finally at Peace After a Long Haunted Ordeal

T ypically when I tell people that I grew up in a haunted house, I get a grab bag of mixed results. Some ask questions and others suddenly seem very uncomfortable, but I have come to accept all of it as a side effect of how I was raised. Maybe I should start with a brief background of the area, property, and home before I get to the details.

I grew up in Ashtabula, Ohio, which is located right in the North East corner of Ohio between Lake Erie and Pennsylvania. It's a cold region with very little commerce, life is poor to say the least. The home I grew up in used to sit along the lakefront but when erosion started taking it under our house and its twin were moved to its current location. The property in which it sits used to be a peach orchard and the sole owner of the orchard lived in a small white house two doors down. Pearl was an elderly woman by the time my family moved in but her memories and mind were sharp. Her story is sad but ties into the tale I am about weave for you.

She was married fairly young to the son of a peach farmer. Their home was built between where the two houses now sit. It was a large grey home with white trim. Pearl and her husband had six children. On a January night their house burned to the ground, the only survivors were Pearl and her husband, all six children were killed. The children ranged in age from 3 to 11. Needless to say, Pearl's husband was riddled with guilt for not saving his children and Pearl stated he cried all the time. He could take no more, 2 months after the fire that destroyed her life, Pearl found her husband hanging from the tree in the backyard, the tree stands to this day.

Well, fast forward to 1987 when I was nine years old and in walks a young family, not knowing the history or stories surrounding our new home. It didn't take long for us to notice ""things"". It started out fairly innocent, you know the sound of footsteps up and down the stairs and my little brother who was 3 at the time talking about the ""shadow man"" on the stairs. These could easily be explained away and so they were. But then things started happening that were not so easily explained away.

It was 2am when our first ""episode"" happened. My father was, at the time, working for an long haul trucking company and was gone quite a bit. It was on one of the occasions that we were woken up by a loud whistling sound coming from the basement. I remember how funny it seemed at the time, like a scene out of I Love Lucy, me and my mom creeping down the stairs in our nightgowns, baseball bats raised to the heavens - just in case we had the ""whistling bandit"" hanging out in our basement! What we found was my brothers old red robot walking across the floor. Now the strangeness of this situation is probably not hitting you yet... Let me elaborate. My brother had not played with his robot in over 2 years, the robot not only required batteries, but water in order to operate correctly and it only whistled when the remote was pressed. All three things were missing from this robot when my mom inspected it. That incident was creepy but what happened next was just terrifying.

My father had a habit, when he was home, he would go for a morning jog at around 5am daily. This day was no different. Dad got up and I could hear him go out the back door and the crunch of his shoes in the snow going down the driveway. Within three minutes the backdoor slammed open and, what I thought was my father, came running up the stairs. I heard my mother say ""What are you doing?"" before she screamed. When I went in to see what happened she was clammy and looked terrified. Here is what she told me: she too had heard my father leave and then the running up the stairs, she had kind of yelled at my dad because she didn't want him waking up my brother, when all of a sudden she was being held down on her side and someone whispered in her ear ""I know what you did"". That's when she screamed. We searched the house from top to bottom and even had my father check when he got home, there was no one in that house and only one set of footsteps in the snow left by my dad leaving for his jog. And then just as the things happened they stopped. Instantly, as if a switch was clicked and then the second wave hit with a vengeance.

By this time, I am an adult with my own child and my brother is a teenager, so about 8 years had lapsed. The first indication that things were not right was when I had first brought my son home from the hospital and went to do laundry in the basement. I was alone in the house and made sure that every door and window in the house was locked and secure before I left my brand new baby sleeping in his bassinet while I went down to start the next load.

I was halfway back up the stairs when the basement door slammed shut on me. So I ran up the stairs, at this point in time thinking a draft must have slammed it shut. I would open it and it would get about 3"" open and then something would push it and it would slam in my face. We did this three times before I had had enough. I yelled out that they had to let me up now and the door popped open. My son was not only still sleeping but no one was there and all windows were closed.

The next incident was when my son was looking out the back door and said ""I like that man"". He was 2 at the time and unfortunately I couldn't see the man he was talking about. ""Over active imagination"" I thought and went back to what I was doing. This happened every day for over a year when finally I asked him if his friend had a name. ""Nope, I don't talk to him he just leans against that tree..."" Now, yes you have guessed it, it was the old Buckeye tree where Pearl's husband had hanged himself. You talk about chills.

In this time minor incidents were also going on in the house. We would have paper floating off the computer desk, hovering in the air, and then landing back onto the desk. We would have glasses of water appear in our kitchen when no one had filled one. Things would come up missing. My son's toys would seemingly ""play"" on their own. I had a Finding Nemo stuffed doll come hurling at me out of the toy room. Not gently dropping on the floor, it was spinning like a football. My mom was hit in the leg by a block that was supposed to be in the block bin behind the closed door of my son's playroom. And then there were the footsteps, they were no longer happening only at night, it was all day long. Up and down the stairs, sometimes it sounded like a stampede it was so loud. Then there was the ""Mommy"" that was constantly whispered in my ear. Day or night I could hear it, but I got called ""Mommy"" by some unforeseen child daily.

All the pictures we took during this time frame had issues. We would change the batteries in the camera, buy a new camera, we even tried only using digital... Nothing would clear them up. We would have blue streaks dancing around our heads, shadows hovering over the tables, or strange swirls on our faces. And we thought that nothing could be worse than this, well we didn't realize they were just ""warming up"" the real surprises were yet to come.

In 2005 we were chosen by our cat to be his family. I say this because he walked in our backdoor uninvited and has been with us since. His name is Sherman and although we sometimes think he has a screw loose he's basically a good cat and one that absolutely loves children. When he first came in the house things started happening. We would hear what we thought were the neighbors fighting but turned out to be something else. Our neighbors had moved because strange things were happening in their house as well and so they left. So our house, we thought, would now be silent.

It was one night that we finally ""heard"" what it said. ""GET IT OUT"" was yelled out in a woman's voice. My mom thought I had said, I thought my mom had said it. Once we realized that there was no other explanation we started getting worried. Then my cat went into the front sitting room one night and started to freak out. I mean he was literally jumping off the walls, screeching, hissing, and appeared to be genuinely terrified. He was hissing and spitting at the far right corner of the room. I went in to try and get him out but ended up with a very nice scar on my arm instead. Finally I yelled out ""Leave him alone"" and the front curtain lifted up and then drifted down (like someone was holding it up) and then my cat was fine.

We also were having thermostat issues. Our furnace was always set at 70 degrees. It had been on that for years now but all of a sudden it would jump up to around 90 degrees. We would be sweating on a 10 below zero day. I thought my son was playing with it and he would always deny it when I would ask him. Finally, I took him by the hand and explained to him that we couldn't do that with this thermostat because it could catch the house on fire and I pushed it back down to 70. I was about three steps away when I heard it click back on. I turned around and wouldn't you know that thermostat was back on 90. I started to take a step back to it when I heard what I can only explain as a grunt, growl, yell kind of noise. Obviously male and obviously not in the mood to be playing around with me with the thermostat. So I took my son and started walking away when I heard the same male voice grunt ""Get Out"". And so I did. I left the house and called my mom on her cell and said I will not step back into that house until it is taken care of.

That day we had a priest come in to ""bless"" the house but it didn't help, if anything, it made it worse. Now my dad was seeing shadows hanging out at the end of the bed. We all felt pinched, slapped, and pushed sometimes. But the worst part was that there were times when the room you were sitting in felt like it was falling. I can't really explain this part well because it would happen so fast but it always happened during dinners. We would sit down (either in the dining room or living room which were not in the same area of the house) and we would hear a loud boom and feel the floor ""fall"" about 6"". This happened twice so we called in some experts to check the foundation of the house, the plumbing, anything we could think of... Everything was fine.

So we had finally had it, in 2006 we moved to Florida and now live in a ghost free zone. We all sleep better, we have all stopped smoking, and for the first time in his life my son is able to sleep through the night peacefully. As for the house, it was purchased by a good friend of ours with the understanding that it was haunted. He has since told us that he plans on selling the house very soon, apparently they don't like him either!

Violent Dream after Litting Candles,"New York, United States",Old Hags / Night Attacks / Sleep Paralysis,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Old Hags / Night Attacks / Sleep Paralysis :: Violent Dream after Litting Candles

I was dreaming that I was in some sort of house, with a huge amount of people... And well, we were all at a blue table of some kind, and I had relatives and friends talking to me, when all of a sudden I'm being picked up and thrown backwards into a wall, I was really freaked out because it felt real. I felt myself above the ground and getting slammed! My friends mother named celia ran to me, while everyone else just looked surprised, and she put her back to my back, held my hands, and told me to pray. So I did and all of a sudden I felt like that thing wasn't there anymore. I just knew it was evil.

Funny thing is a few days before the dreams, I had put two candles in my house because of all the weird happenings, and one was to banish evil from the home, the other was for the dead. They were prepared candles, and I'm guessing maybe the spirit was upset because I was trying to make it leave? I told my friends mom about it because she happened to be with me when I bought and lit the candles, she also said a few prayers in my house to kind of help along the process. The whole thing has me really freaked out. If anyone has any ideas please let me know.

Also, Just some background information... I've seen things my whole life, only shapes, never full forms of people (face, eyes etc) just their auras or shadows, and I've heard things since I was younger, I will take the time out to write about my other experiences but right now I just really need advice about this one, thanks so much for taking the time out to read it.

Grandpa Was Concerned About the Land,Mexico,Family / Friends Visits,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Family / Friends Visits :: Grandpa Was Concerned About the Land

T his happened in durango mexico, I live near dallas texas. My grandfather came to visit us last year around this time of year and left at new years, he was a little ill at the time but he was old so it was kind of expected. A few months after he got back to mexico he had a stroke and became unresponsive. He was a a coma like state for about a month, then he passed away.

Nothing happened for a couple of month (I think it was around june or july), then a man called my aunt (my grandpa lived with my aunt in mexico along with her husband, 2 year old kid and a dog) so a man called my aunt and asked to speak with my grandpa. It was then that my aunt told the man that he had died a few month earlier. The man didn't believe her. He said that he got a phone call from my grandpa 3 days ago and he left him a voice mail to call him back. Naturally my aunt began to cry and told him again that he was dead. The man was freaked out. Then my aunt asked him what the message was about, the man said that my grandpa had him fix a machine that he used to fertilize his fields (my grandpa had some land and was obsessed with it, that's all he thought about. Even in his old age he would wake up at four am and ride his bike to the field and tend to it). The message said if the machine was fixed and that he (my grandpa) really needed it back as soon as possible. The man was a traveling engineer of sorts so its understandable that he didn't know he had died.

But the man still didn't believe my aunt so a few days later, when he brought the machine back to the house, my aunt showed his the death certificate and the man got scared. Now this a small mexican town where everyone is catholic and very superstitious. The man ordered the local church to dedicate a special mass for my grandpa because he thought he was being haunted. So my uncle took over the fields after my grandpa died. When they got the machine back, the man put it to use, but after a few days the machine broke again and he tried to fix it.

Well that night or a couple of nights later, my aunt had a dream about my grandpa asking her to get the machine fixed because he didn't want the plants to die because the only reason he worked so hard was to that the land would provide then with everything they needed. My aunt was sad and kind of scared at the same time about the dream, so she called up the man again and he drove a few hundred miles to fix it at no charge, then he dedicated another mass for my grandpa. The machine got fixed and nothing else really happened.

But around august my aunt's son said that he saw my grandpa walking around in the morning. It was then that my aunt called my mother to tell her about it. My mom was very emotional but I thought it was kind of cool. My uncle is now taking care of the fields and they haven't seen him since.

Strange Conversation in Jennisons Cemetary,"Indiana, United States",Apparitions / Voices / Touches,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Apparitions / Voices / Touches :: Strange Conversation in Jennisons Cemetary

W hen I was about eight years old, my family went in search of the ""lost graves"" of our ancestors. We all have lost graves. They are the ones that have been documented as being in one town and they are actually in the one across the bay. This usually happens to those that have gone long before us when there was no real documentations of marriages, births or deaths. Not everyone chooses to spend a two week family vacation looking for them as my parents did, but my father has been into his genealogy for as long as I can remember. I wonder if finding out that one of his relatives was a real live pirate had anything to do with that. I guess we can't all wear the white hat!

Our four unit family went to Eagle Harbour, Michigan, USA to stay at the Jennisons hotel right on the lake. I do not recall the name of the hotel, but the Jennisons had been there for my parents honeymoon and were still there for our vacation. There was a delightfully scary cemetery down the road and the hotel loaned out bikes to their guests and as my father was not going to check out the cemetery until the next day, I thought I would get a head start. Wouldn't it be marvelous if I could help him in this search?

The fence was laying on its side like an old tired out sentry and the gate was hanging on a hinge that promised to let loose the moment that someone touched it. All I knew was that the cemetery opened almost as soon as the town was formed so I was looking at over 200 years of history written in stone. The only warning I had was flitting around in my head, and all it said was to watch out for the sunken graves and to give them wide berth. That may have just been remnants of the coaching of my father, but it FELT different.

I heard a males voice, so to be quite honest, I walked towards the sound. I was hoping to find a caretaker or at the very least someone who could give me a bit of information about the cemetery. I was a newcomer to the wonderful world of cemetery gazing and I thought I might need some tips that did not come from my father. I mean, how much could he possibly know that someone else didn't?

In the back of the cemetery was a chicken wire type fence that protected twenty to thirty plain white wooden crosses. There was no gate, you just sort of unhooked the end of the fence from the beginning of it and pulled it out far enough to walk in and then refastened it. The first thing that struck me was the silence in the fenced-in areas. Aside from the male voice carrying on a conversation with a voice I couldn't hear answer, there was no other noise. No rodents through the dried leaves, no birds in the trees, no crickets calling to another... Nothing.

Standing inside the chicken wire fence I turned slowly, a bit confused. Okay, I was really confused. There was no writing on any of the crosses. No names, dates, soothing words to loved ones left behind. Marked graves for unknown persons? I noticed the man who owned the voice then. He was sitting beside a fresh grave holding onto what looked like daisies and just talking about everyday things. I assumed he had very recently lost a loved one so I left him be with his private emotions and went back to the crosses.

Upon exiting that ""gate"" I noticed a sign that I had not seen before. It said quite simply ""Colored"". I grew up knowing about racial differences and was even locked in a basement during the Detroit Riots, but I was caught completely off guard. Good Lord, have we not come far enough that my neighbor of color and my neighbor of peach could not find a resting place beside each other?

Angry, I went to talk to the man at the grave. He told me that we may be equal in God's eyes, but man is still having problems filling in the other colors. We spoke for a while and then I took my leave. I got about half way back through when I realised that I should have asked his name, being young, I went back to ask.

I found no new grave. I found just a few rotted boards sticking out of the ground where the crosses had once been. The graves were overgrown with vines, brush and blueberry plants. Under all the dead leaves, I located some rusty chicken wire. I ran like the guardians of Hell themselves were after me. I tripped over a marker, bounced off another, fell on a couple more and jumped the outer fence onto the bike and headed back to the hotel with flames belching out the back tire of that poor Schwinn.

After excitedly telling my father what happened, he took me back there. This is not to say he believed me. He did not. He was set on proving to me that my imagination would only lead me to trouble. He explained that there could be no new graves as this was an inactive cemetery and there are no rows of crosses as he researched it all the night before. All was as he stated. Walking all through the cemetery there were no signs of anyone having been there for quite a few years.

All except for the skid marks of little feet. And piles of leaves where the skid marks ended. And my father's great-great-great-aunt's grave, and that of her baby who were supposed to be buried in Eagle River that I had uncovered when I tripped over the one and bounced into the other.

I still can not explain what may have actually happened that day in that sun drenched cemetery. I researched for years and all I came up with for the crosses was a documented and well cared for site of a Tom Brown. His wooden marker says simply: Tom Brown/colored/died 05. The date may be wrong as there are several accounts of this sailor who actually passed on a voyage to Michigan and his body was laid to rest here. I don't think I fell asleep, I was not unaccounted for long.

What happened? Does ANYBODY else have a similar experience that could shed some light on this?

Ghost Near the Trees Made Him Sick,Bangladesh,Apparitions / Voices / Touches,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Apparitions / Voices / Touches :: Ghost Near the Trees Made Him Sick

M y aunty just bought a house and started to decorate it. Her husband, my uncle was helping her. It was around 11 at night when they decided to stop all the work. They packed everything up and got out. My uncle was too tired to drive so he told my aunty to. They were half way home when my aunty realized that she didn't lock the door. They turned and drove back to the house. They went in and checked everything and then locked the door.

They were driving when another driver stopped his car in the middle of the road. My aunty beeped but the man didn't move. Suddenly my uncle started to feel sick. He was burning up and started to fidget in his seat. My aunty started to panic - one hand her husband suddenly fell ill and on the other the man in front won't move his car. She started to beep again when something caught her eye. She looked sideward and saw a woman in a white dress. She had long black greasy hair which she didn't stop stroking. My aunty got scared looking at the lady, I mean who will come outside at 11pm stand near the trees and just touch her hair.

The man in front moved his car and my aunty drove up (my uncle stopped fidgeting). She looked at the side mirror but saw the lady was gone. She turned around and saw no one there. She asked her husband did he see her. He said no. He said that he suddenly started to feel cold (his side was near the trees) when they went past the trees.

My aunty quickly drove home not looking back for the lady. Since then she never went outside after 10.

Well what do you think? Hope you liked it there's plenty more! See ya

Ghost Cats,"Colorado, United States",Pets / Animals,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Pets / Animals :: Ghost Cats

I don't believe in ghosts, and I still don't, to this day. It's nothing personal and nothing against those who do believe in them, but my own beliefs will not allow it. But... I do have a couple unexplained stories from my past, and I do not know if they have logical reasons or if they were just dreams. I am curious about your honest opinions, nonetheless, and I have written to you for answers.

I was really into goosebumps when I was younger. I was watching a movie made from one of the books about a piano where the ghost in the book is just a pair of hands that plays the keys. The song in it was really haunting. Later that night, I'm asleep and I hear the piano playing that song outside my bedroom (it was down the hallway in the sitting room). So I get up and I can still hear it as I walk down the hall, but when I get into the room with the piano, it stops. I go back into (well, run back into) my room and get back in bed and it starts again. Of course by this time I'm terrified, so I just suffer there in bed listening to it until it finishes and I go to sleep with my light on.

I'm thinking it was just a dream from being scared by the movie? But then why do I remember opening the door and feeling the floor on my feet when I investigated? My second story, that convinces me more than this first:

We had four black cats (no, I'm not superstitious - these cats brought more luck than misfortune!) and when a couple of them died, I used to see shadows out of the corner of my eye, like a cat jumping on a counter or crossing into another room. But no cat was there when I looked again. My mom said it was just because I was used to seeing them. When my favorite cat died that I had been very close to all my life, I swear I could still feel her jump on the end of my bed at night and lie down. I would sit up sometimes to pet her or feel for her, but of course, nothing.

Since both these instances I have seen neither hide nor hair of a ghost, and after my mom told me that the cats were just my imagination used to seeing them run around, I stopped seeing that as well. But were these real encounters? Especially with my beloved cat?

Our New Grandmother,Australia,Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: Our New Grandmother

I have a little trouble remembering specifics of this experience as I was young and have tried very hard not to remember them over the years as well! This took place in Brisbane, Queensland and my relatives still live in the house today.

I was about 10 when my aunty and uncle and my two younger cousins moved into a beautiful old Queenslander in an older, more historic side of Brisbane. The house was huge and situated near big old school for children with special needs, which used to be a retirement home as we learnt, many years before it became the school. There was also a newer aged home facility directly across the road.

After a couple of months after moving in, my family visited one day. My two cousins and I were playing in one of the boys bedrooms when I left for a drink or something and came back to see my cousin sitting on the floor playing with an old (and I mean OLD, about 90) lady sitting on the bed watching him. She was as plain as day and nothing felt strange about it, I figured she was someone from the other side of the family who I didn't know, and had entered whilst I was gone. It must have been about 15 or 20 minutes or so that went by and she just sat there watching us and occasionally talking to someone who wasn't us. Neither my cousin or I said anything to each other about her, just figured the other one knew who she was. It started creeping me out that she was just watching us play and not talk so I decided to have a chat but when I turned up to look at her she wasn't there. I didn't think anything of it, it was a big room and we weren't facing her so she could have left.

Months after this I didn't go to the house and one day at a family get together, my cousin told me the lady always comes into his room or the bathroom and asks where the little blonde girl is (me) and that she liked me because I reminded her of when she was a girl. This struck me as odd. Why wouldn't she ask my aunt or uncle where I was?

I think it was about a year or so later that I went back to the house when my younger cousin came running up to me and told me there was someone who wanted to see me. I didn't even think it would be her, but I went in his room and sure enough there she was, but this time very very pale, and something smelt like it was starting to rot in the room (and after I accused my cousin of producing the smell...) and smelt a little musty I think, then I figured out what was going on. I was so scared I couldn't move or talk or anything. My cousin sat down and started to play and she just stared at me and smiled the whole time whilst I was frozen up against the bedroom wall. Eventually I asked her where she came from and she gestured towards no particular place. I asked if it was the old folks home the road and she shook her head to say no. I looked at my cousin and looked back at her and she was gone. I asked him if he had heard what she had said and he had no idea of what I was talking about, just that some lady asked me to go to his room.

That was the last any of my cousins remember seeing her, except a few years later my cousin was woken up and still sleepy, heard a lady say ""you kids are all grown up now, you used to wear me out walking all the way from the home to see you"" or something along the lines of that. After that he asked my aunty who the old lady was in his room and she flipped out understandably. But they still live there and nothing has ever happened, and I am still too scared to go back there, and even more scared to talk about it with my family. I never really thought it was real until my cousin brought it up last year, which gave me a huge shock. She was a sweet old thing I guess. I just found it strange that she never spoke to me.

Little Girl in my Room,Costa Rica,Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: Little Girl in my Room

I was about 12yrs old and I was playing in my front yard. I came in to my house after playing and put all of my things in my room. I came into the kitchen where my mom and a friend were drinking coffee. I noticed my mom kept looking at the door to the entrance of my room. She then said ""Naty have your little friend come and have a snack with us"" I looked at her and asked ""what friend?"" ahe said ""the one your room!"" I looked at her and said ""there is no one in my room come see"" and I took her hand and we walked towards my room. She thought I was joking and she looked under my bed and in my closet. Nothing! She looked at me puzzled and said ""I saw a small girl about 4' tall with two pink bows curly blonde hair and in a pink dress. She kept peaking out of your room looking at us in the kitchen!"" I looked at her and just shrugged my shoulders not knowing what to tell her. After that we kept hearing and seeing different things in the house. I will tell you about all our experiences.

What do you all think? Weird right? We were told that the little girl had been seen in the property before. Even while under construction, at night. Our neighbors said they would see someone walking and playing in the house at night... To be continued!

Something Agitates the Dog,"South Carolina, United States",Misc,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Misc :: Something Agitates the Dog

M y husband and I used to live in a small two bedroom house in the country. We preferred sleeping in the back, slightly smaller bedroom due to the reduction in road noise and morning sun. One afternoon, as I was lying on the bed with books and my laptop I rolled over to rest my neck and noticed the ceiling fan slowly turning. Strange, because it was turning so slowly, even slower than it would on low. And stranger since I didn't the have fan on anyway!

I watched it until it stopped, not more than a minute or so. Nothing scary, I didn't feel strange or threatened or any of the other feelings you supposedly get with a supernatural encounter. It was an old house so it could very well have been some type of electrical surge which cause the fan to start turning; however, the lights didn't dim and it never happened again. There's a small chance it could have been a draft since the house was old, but all the exterior windows and doors were closed.

Afterward I began to notice our dog wouldn't come into that room. She'd stare into it. She walk by. She stand in the doorway, but never came in. And as I began thinking about it, I realized she had never come into that room. She had never followed us in there at night, or napped under the bed or sat with me as I was working in there. Prior to the fan incident she'd stand in the doorway and bark, only a few times I remember. I just chalked that up to the window being directly opposite the door. I assumed she was barking at the shrubs blowing around or a bird on the sill, or something outside. And, as I said, it rarely happened.

Putting together the fan turning on its own and the dog's trepidation to the room I began doing some investigating. I knew a bit about the home as we had bought it from my husband's father who bought it from a friend. After further digging I discovered the friend's wife's mother had actually built the house in the 1960s. Not so old, so I felt I was at a dead end. However, I also discovered that the mother had lived prior to that in a much older home, circa mid 1800s I was told, which wasn't more than a barn type structure when she began construction on the new home. Since the owners didn't have much money some older neighbors remember the house being built; apparently it was a big ripple that someone of their class could build a brand new house. So I'm thinking I'm onto something.

I try to talk to the previous owner's mother and she didn't have any comments about which bedroom her mother used, or where she had passed, or anything about the much older house on the property. Very tight lipped about the whole situation. I didn't feel it polite to push as she seemed still upset by her mother's passing. However I did find out that she grew up in the newer house and her older siblings were raised in the old one. Courthouse records showed the land and a home, but was hand drawn without exact measurements of where the house stood.

All we ever found of the old house were a few stones from the porch, a couple pieces of broken china washed into a gulley and some rusty tools buried in what would have been the front yard. From this we had an idea of its approximate location. It never really set right with me. The happenings I witnessed, the dog's reaction, the mother's refusal to speak of the house. We moved to the family farm in the same area a couple years later and it still took me a few years of riding by that house to realize that the bedroom window, which dog would bark at, would have been directly perpendicular to the front yard of the old house. This was before the digital imaging/ghost hunting movement and I so wish that we had the opportunity or foresight to take photos. The mother moved from Chicago and built a house in a nearby area and has a mural of her mother's house, our previous home, in her sitting room. I can't help but have the feeling that if the daughter loved this home so much to this day, perhaps her mother did too. Perhaps she never wanted to leave something she had worked and waited so long for.

"Sally, my Friend","Maine, United States",Ouija Board / Seances,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Ouija Board / Seances :: Sally, my Friend

I am going to tell you about a very odd and disturbing story of mine. It all started on November 5th 2006. Hope you enjoy it! I was up in my bathroom brushing my teeth when the toilet flushed behind me. I was all alone in the house. My mom ran out to the Grocery Store. I turned around but no one was there. I started to get a little nervous but kept on doing my thing.

Then, I went in my room to take out the clothes I was going to wear. I went to open my drawer but the drawer flew open and the clothes I was going to wear flew out! I started to get very nervous so I went downstairs to call my mom when I heard a little girl's voice. Something inside of me said I didn't need to be afraid... But boy was I ever! I grabbed the phone and went to my neighbors house.

About 1 week passed and I hadn't heard of seen anything so I thought maybe it was just my imagination. Then one night my friend Brittany slept over. We had both just fallen asleep when she woke me up crying! I said ""Brittany what's wrong?"" She said ""Morgan! someone just opened the door!"" I said ""Are you serious?"" She stressed over and over to me that she was telling the truth! I looked around and just as I took my eyes away from the door, I caught a glance of a girl with light brown hair about to her shoulders with a bow in it. I wanted to scream but I didn't because I didn't want to wake my mom and dad.

We got up and went down in the basement. We took out my Ouija board and fiddled with that. A few minutes later I said ""Is there a spirit here who wishes to speak?"" We took our hands off of the moving thing for 1 minute and when we looked down, it was moving! It spelled out the word yes! I said ""What's your name?"" We had our hands off of the moving thing and it moved again and spelled out the word Sally. Then I asked how old she was. She spelled out the word seven. My friend and I were just too stunned to even speak!

We immediately got on the computer and I typed in the history of our house. When the info came up, we both turned pale. It said ""In 1991 a girl named sally was dying of pneumonia"". There was nothing anyone could do to save her. She died on October 1st 1991. She was only 7 years old. This all happened in Topsham, Maine.

If you have any questions, please feel free to post a message or e-mail me! Thanks!

Barnstorm Kashmir,India,Poltergeists / Physical Manifestations,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Poltergeists / Physical Manifestations :: Barnstorm Kashmir

D uring this summer vacation -- back in Kashmir -- every morning we would get up to hear the latest lowdown about Abdullah, the ghost in our neighbor's newly built home. My sis would religiously narrate the Jinn's slate of activities from the previous day. She would in turn get the dope straight from the horse's mouth - that is - lady of the haunted house.

Anyone who visited my neighbors' home would ostensibly find his/her shoes/sandals/floaters instantly thrown out of the place. The Jinn - they named him Abdullah -- seemed to harbor some kind of a strong revulsion for the footwear, I was told. In my characteristic style, I tried to rubbish the supernatural claims until my neighbor himself confided in me about the strange paranormal occurrence. He even invited me to witness the spectacle - shoes flying off - which I politely declined. On a personal note, I am a little scared of these phantoms, which tease at will.

A significant part of our idle talk invariably used to center around Abdullah, the boot hater. My pals -- Wasy, Raj and Salus -- were all curious, like me for the latest ghostly update. Stories like the Jinn swinging doors at odd hours or digging up the lawn at midnight or talking in eerie voices continued to come. Frankly I'd get goose bumps. The last I've heard -- on phone -- is that Abdullah has started talking in some exotic language and he still continues to chuck shoes out of the beautiful one-story house of my good neighbor.

Ever heard of a spick and span spook! Happens in Kashmir, only.

Held Down by Shadow,"Texas, United States",Old Hags / Night Attacks / Sleep Paralysis,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Old Hags / Night Attacks / Sleep Paralysis :: Held Down by Shadow

T his is the first time anything like this has happened to me. I was asleep dreaming some random dream of me in my car with someone I have never met driving it. Then, I'm not sure if it was in my dream or not, but I was awoke by a female voice saying my name. It just said my name once and I was wide awake. It wasn't long or drawn out, just short like someone trying to get my attention.

I awoke and moved my head back and forth looking around my room. I looked left because that's the direction I heard the voice, but saw nothing so I turned my head right and all of a sudden it looked like a shadow had reached its arm across me and pinned me down. The shadow was angled as if it were standing on the side of my bed hovering over me. It looked like one arm on each of my shoulders holding me down and then its head was face to face with me.

There was no definition in the face or body, it just looked like a shadow. Its head was moving up and down rapidly, towards my face then away. I squeezed my eyes closed and tried my hardest to move but nothing happened, I tried to scream but all that came out was a few moans/grunts. It lasted maybe 10 seconds and when I opened my eyes again it was gone and I could move.

Immediately after it happened I wasn't scared anymore until I sat there and thought about what just happened. I have read about REM but not convinced since I was moving my head, legs and arms when I awoke right before it happened. I checked the shadows around in my room to see if maybe I had mistaken the arm and face for another shadow but my ceiling was half way lit up by a light on my radio. I also looked to the side of my bed while it was happening and noticed that it had no lower body, as if it was an upper torso. I didn't feel like someone was touching me but I could not move a muscle. I do believe that when I squeezed my eyes shut I turned my head to the left.

I'm not exactly sure what time it happened but by time I gathered the courage to get out of bed and turn the light on, it was 6:08am

Myrtles Plantation Tour 2,"Louisiana, United States",Ghost Tours & Haunted Hotels,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Ghost Tours & Haunted Hotels :: Myrtles Plantation Tour 2

T his is my second story about my stay at The Myrtles Plantation . The first one included pictures of what I thought was a face. The first few comments on my page agreed they see a face but think it might be nothing more then wanting to see something there. I have to agree that is probably the case, but it is still the first picture I show people when I talk about my trip. I will include some other pictures with Orb's in them with this one.

I want to tell you a little about the house in case anyone plans on going there. It is not one of the biggest or best kept places in Louisiana to see. The grounds outside are beautiful, but the house itself is old and once inside you can see that. It does make the whole haunting thing seem a bit more authentic but for a bed in breakfast, don't expect a 5 start hotel treatment. There are no TV's, radio's, computers, internet connections, or anything electronic in the house. It also has poor lighting in every room. The atmosphere is set up to scare people. We could hear everything inside and outside of the house from our room. For instance there was a noise we kept hearing in our room upstairs and we could not tell where it was coming from. Well, before we left we realize that anytime someone shut a door we could hear the chandelier rattle.

I have also learned that most of the stories they tell on the Ghost Tour can not be confirmed to be true. It doesn't mean they are completely made up or that they place is not haunted, just that the origin of the hauntings may not be accurate.

It is said that the house may be over an Indian burial site. That might be what started this off to begin with. There have been sighting of a little Indian girl around the house. There have been many deaths either by poison, diseases, and even murder on the property. There have even been sightings of civil was soldiers.

I would love to go stay there again, once on the grounds its almost like you have stepped back in time.

A Lifetime Haunting,United Kingdom,A Haunted Life,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: A Haunted Life :: A Lifetime Haunting

I was around 7 years of age when I had my first experience. One thing I should make clear is that I don't remember much of my childhood and I'm sure it has something to do with my experiences while I lived in this particular house as a child.

It was late of night and I couldn't sleep. I can't remember whether it was because I was excited as something was happening the next day, but I do remember I was sitting up in bed reading a book. (I can even tell you the book I was reading - Read it Yourself, Jack and the Beanstalk) I don't know when I became aware of it but I could hear footsteps right outside my bedroom window, back and forth, then back and forth again. It was almost as if someone or something was pacing, waiting and there was an air of anticipation. It unnerved me, but at that time I wasn't scared, I just remember thinking to myself ""Who would be walking underneath my window this late of a night?"" I knew it wasn't my Mam or Dad because I'd heard them go to bed.

For some reason Mam had never put curtains in my window and my bed was situated so that I couldn't see the window when I was in bed. I was aware that the footsteps had stopped but, again, at the time I thought nothing of it. I suddenly became aware of something or someone watching me. I felt compelled to turn around and look out of the window, so I did...

What I saw will be with me for the rest of my life and I still get heart palpitations when I think of it, I am now, as I'm writing this down.

A pair of eyes were staring at me and not just any eyes; they were red rimmed, hollow and evil. They appeared to be glowing as it was dark outside. I stared transfixed. I felt paralyzed and couldn't move. As sudden as the paralysis came over me it left and I was able to turn away. And turn away I did indeed. I was so scared that I grabbed my nearest teddy bear and cuddled down into my bed with the covers up to my chin and bawled my eyes out.

The feeling of being watched left me and the pacing of footsteps resumed. I don't know what time the footsteps stopped but I do know that as I drifted into an uneasy sleep they were still there and felt like they were reverberating through my head.

The next morning I told Mam and Dad what I had seen, they scoffed and laughed at me, saying what a vivid imagination I had. I felt like crying again. I knew it was real but no-one believed me. My Dad said that I should have come and got him if someone was walking around the garden and he explained the eyes as a car going down the road. It could have been feasible if it hadn't been for the huge hedge that hid cars from view and not being able to see the road from my bedroom window. But being the skeptical people they are, they rationalized and tried to explain it away as a natural occurrence - and maybe it was - but I didn't think so, and nor do I think so now.

From that time on I was afraid of the dark and didn't like the fact that there were no curtains in my window. Mam never did put curtains up though, not until we moved house. She said that because we were in the country I didn't need them.

A couple of weeks later I remember playing in the woods with my brother and friends. I can't remember what happened but I can remember a ""woman"" and ""red shoes"". I remember being scared and running like mad. It wouldn't be until years later, in fact a few years ago, that Mam would reveal something to me that disturbed me and is possibly linked to my experience.

I don't know how long it was after the experience but I'd made Mam move my bed to the other side of the room so that I could face anything head on. I had some strange idea that I would be safer if I could see the window. Mam had tucked me into bed and I had left strict instructions for her to ""leave the landing light on"" as Mam wouldn't leave a light on in my room. I had settled down to sleep with my hands on top of the duvet. I felt warm and safe - looked after. I became aware of a presence but this time it wasn't threatening and I didn't feel any evil, just warmth. Someone took hold of my hand which frightened me because I knew there wasn't anything or anyone in the room with me. I jerked my hand away and put them under the covers and this time I said nothing to Mam and Dad. They didn't believe me when I told them of my other experiences, why would they believe me now? Besides I didn't want to be laughed at again.

I can't remember if I had anymore experiences but after the holding of my hand I have always felt like I'm being watched over and looked after. We moved when I was 11 to a new area and I continued having paranormal experiences but none as frightening as this one. I became fascinated with hauntings and would read anything paranormal that I could get my hands on.

At 33, I still feel that whoever or whatever was there in that house is still playing a big part of my life. I have been starting to get flashbacks of my childhood and I don't know whether it has any significance to my experience.

About 2 years ago I was cleaning my son's room out and I had the feeling that someone was standing in the doorway. I turned around expecting it to be my husband creeping up on me but it wasn't. There was a man standing in the door, for just a split second and then he disappeared. I believe that this man is the same one that held my hand as a child and has been looking out for me ever since. I see him as my guardian angel.

I know the house I'm living in now has a spirit, but the spirit of a woman. The reason I know this is that my husband and I have seen her on separate occasions. Also, a couple of months ago we'd been shopping and decided that we would get a taxi home. As we pulled up outside our house the taxi man declared ""this is my aunt's old house"" and then went on to say ""she lived here in the 40's"". He helped us with the shopping and kept looking at the house with a dreamy smile on his face. In fact he seemed reluctant to leave. In the end he looked at us and his final parting words were ""say hello to her for me"". As we walked into the house I said to my husband ""Did he just say what I thought he said?"" We were both just a little freaked by this but as I was unpacking the shopping I found myself saying out loud ""Your nephew just dropped us off and he says hello!""

Besides I'm digressing here, and as I mentioned before I have started to get flashbacks around the time I lived in that house. I was talking to my Mam on the phone and I was asking her about a particular flash back I'd recently had - I was in the living room with my dad, he was putting on my socks and telling me that it was okay and there was nothing to be scared of. I remember being very scared and nothing my father said would help - Mam said that it was nothing and when I asked my dad, he told me that he was taking me on his rounds as a gamekeeper. I didn't believe him. I was so used to my dad's job having grown up with it that I knew this wasn't the case. I still don't know whether my parents are deliberately keeping something from me or to this day they can't genuinely remember.

Mam went on to reveal that while we lived in there that I kept having ""nightmares"" about a woman in red shoes walking around the garden. I asked Mam whether she was sure it was nightmares I was having or something more, but as Mam and Dad are the most skeptical people I know, they are adamant that it was just nightmares. I on the other hand don't believe they were...

I have had flashbacks of a woman standing. She is wearing a white top with a red skirt and has red shoes on. Whether this is the woman Mam was referring to I don't know, neither do I know whether it is connected to what I have experienced.

The name Mary also keeps cropping up a number of times from spiritualists. No-one in our family went by the name Mary and I don't know whether it's connected or not. I do know that my time in that house is very patchy and I can't remember anything significant ever happening again. Whether it was too traumatic for me and I've blocked it out has occurred to me, but I'm too frightened of seeing someone about it in the event that I do remember something that I don't want to, or is so traumatic that it will affect me even more than it has done so already.

I feel compelled to write an account of my experiences because I feel that even today I'm still being haunted by it. Maybe there is a rational explanation for it and if anyone can offer one I'd be grateful. I also want to know where Mary comes into this. Is she the woman in red shoes or someone else? And more importantly has she got a message for me? There are so many things that come back to me, some I remember and others fade away again and elude me. The main thing is that I think I need help to solve this mystery that hangs over this experience.

When I was five years old my family moved to a house in Alabang City. It was a nice house and had a main family house, a dance house, and tea room that hung from a cliff. The price of the house was extremely affordable and a very good deal. The realtor told us that it was a steal.

We moved in that very week and everything was fine for a few months. My family hired maids to take care of us, in the Philippines we call them ya-yas. The hauntings started only a month after being in that house. My parents would sometimes sit out front of the house and one day when my mom was waiting for my dad to come home, she was out front and she saw a women walking in the front yard. She look like any other flesh and blood person but when my mother looked down at this woman's legs, she did not have any, she was floating across our lawn and she disappeared by some trees.

Another time, my father was walking through the hallway of the house and he saw black figures going from one doorway to another, when he went to check who it was, no one was there. The ya-yas would also be tormented. Many times they would leave because they would have their names called by the ghosts. The ghosts would say ya-ya Linda, ya-ya Linda, or who ever the ya-ya's name was. Many time the ya-yas would start the bath for me and my sister and the water and lights in the bathroom would turn off by themselves before we were even able to get to the bathroom.

One time me and my sister were in our bedroom and the TV went on and off by itself and the doors began opening and closing on their own. My parents took us out of the room immediately. After this incident, my parents asked the realtor if anything happened in the house before we moved in. The realtor was at first apprehensive to tell us anything, but after my father began shouting at her, she became more willing to say what happened. The realtor explained that there was a family that lived in the house before us and the father of the family went on a shooting spree and killed his entire family and himself in the house. This is why the house was so cheap. After finding this out, my father threaten to sue the realtor for not telling us. The realtor agreed to settle and our money was given back since we paid in cash for the house. We moved within a month.

This was the scariest house I have lived in and I will never forget it. Unfortunately, I have lived in other haunted houses. Hopefully, I never have to live in another one again.

"Jimmy, my Little Brother's Friend","Virginia, United States",Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: Jimmy, my Little Brother's Friend

W hen I was a child, we lived in a rented house just outside of Richmond Va, near a 2-3 story Elementary School just off of Hull Street. The house was a small two bedroom one story house. I don't recall exactly when it started but my younger brother started talking about his best friend Jimmy, which he had ""made up"" because he really had no other children is age to play with. My brother and I shared a bedroom and whenever I came into the room, my brother would say that Jimmy was hiding from me because he didn't like to be seen. During the time that we lived in this house, we were given a German Shepard puppy who we named ""Lady"", whose parents were guard dogs at the Towing Service where our father worked. My brother adored that dog and played with her all of the time.

There was one summer afternoon, when I was 5 and my brother was 3, that my brother and ""Lady"" left our yard and went for a walk. Sometime later, my brother returned very upset that Lady had ripped his pants. My parents were surprised by this because Lady was a very gentle dog, even for a puppy and asked my brother what he was doing and where he was when this happened. He said that he and Jimmy were going to ""see the water"" (there was a small pond surrounded by trees at the end of our street) and that every time they tried to go beyond the trees, Lady would bark and growl at Jimmy so much that my brother decided to take her home. Lady finally grabbed my brother by his ""britches"" and drug him home. Our parents reminded my brother that he was not allowed to walk down to the pond alone and that Lady was doing her job by bringing him home, but my brother was adamant that he was not alone, he was with Jimmy. My mother made the comment that Jimmy's mother probably wanted him to come home and my brother said that he was home, that we lived in his house, that he lived in the house first, that his mother went away.

I don't remember exactly when we moved out of the house, but I do know that Jimmy was not mentioned after we moved. When I was in high school years later, I was riding around with my boyfriend at the time and saw the old school. We drove down our old street and stopped a lady who was walking a dog in front of the house that we lived in. I asked her how long she lived in the neighborhood and if she knew anything about the house. She said that there was a lady who lived at the end of the street who could help me. When I asked her about that house, she grew a little pale and seemed to shiver. I told her that I lived there in the early 1970s. The only thing that she would say was that there was a mother and little boy who lived in that house and that the little boy drowned in the pond one summer. I asked if his name was Jimmy and she just looked at me and said ""how did you know that?"".

I should mention that my brother did not remember Jimmy until my mother retold the story, he did suddenly remember him, but he said that he was a REAL person but that he couldn't understand why he lived in our closet.

Startling Knocks At My Window,"South Carolina, United States",Misc,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Misc :: Startling Knocks At My Window

I have a habit of being awake in the wee hours of the morning on a fairly regular basis. This particular morning I was up late working on some music projects. I had my earbuds in listening to a track when suddenly I heard 3 loud rapid knocks right at the window behind my bed's headboard.

It scared the living s#!+ out of me! Startled, I snatched out my earbuds and laid low for a brief moment wondering who in the h*! Could be knocking on my window at this time of the morning. This has never happened before so I'm there ducked down trying to process what just happened.

In those brief moments my mind is racing and I thought for a second could it have been one of my household relatives that went outside and perhaps locked themselves out? Then I thought could it be someone from around the neighborhood up to no good or perhaps needing something?

Then I thought that maybe I was hearing things, but the knocking was LOUD and I actually felt the THUD of the window. That's actually what got my attention, and it was loud enough that I heard it beyond my earbuds.

I quickly jumped out of bed and grabbed my pistol. I then slowly peeped out the blinds of the window to see if anyone was out there but oddly there was no one there.

That side of the house is well lit by a nearby street light and my car was right there next to that window. Still peeping out the window I looked around the car and waited to see if maybe someone was hiding behind it on the other side, but I didn't see anyone. I angled my gaze downward to see if anyone might have ducked down below the window alongside the house but no one was in sight.

I then went out of my bedroom and slowly peaked around the corner into the front room to see if by chance anyone else was awake and happened to make a loud noise which I thought was at the window, but came from another part of the house instead. However, I saw that they were all sound asleep, snoring loudly.

I then peaked out the blinds in the front room (where my relatives were sleeping) to look out in the yard but I saw no one in the yard. If someone were to flee it would've took them a few minutes to get far enough to exit the yard, and they would've been well in view of the street light.

I went back in my bedroom and looked at the clock on my laptop. I saw it was 2:48, right before 3am (which is said to be ""Witching Hour""). At this point I'm on edge and starting to think that it may have been something paranormal happening.

For the sake of protection I burned some sage and told whatever it was to leave me alone and return where it came from.

I laid back down in bed on edge for the remainder of the morning until daybreak, but nothing else ever did happen.

The following night came and I again, was awake in the wee hours. Naturally I was on edge waiting for something to happen again but nothing ever did.

Rumor Or Real?,Japan,Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: Rumor Or Real?

T here is a small Japanese-style washoku restaurant I sometimes go to. It is an old place with a wooden sign and a sliding door. Inside the floor is covered with tatami, the tables are low, and the smell of grilled fish and dashi hangs in the air. The menu is fixed, with set meals of rice, miso soup, simmered vegetables, pickles, and fish.

People in the neighborhood have spoken about the place for years. They say that if you stay there too late, unusual things begin to happen. I never believed it until one night I went there with my friend.

It was close to closing time. The dining room was empty except for us. The waitress came to take our orders, bowed politely, and walked quickly down the corridor toward the kitchen. Her footsteps echoed unnaturally against the floor.

While we waited, the light above our table flickered. We both looked up, then shrugged it off. A few minutes later, a clatter broke the silence. A pair of chopsticks had fallen onto the tatami from the table next to ours. The strange thing was that no one had been sitting there.

Not long after, I felt a tap on my shoulder. It was light, like the touch of a waiter. I turned, but no one was there. When I looked forward again, the waitress was just then coming out of the kitchen, carrying our trays with both hands.

We ate quietly. The food was the same as always, but the silence of the room pressed down on us. After the last orders were served, the kitchen lights went out. I heard the faint sound of pans being stacked, and then there was nothing.

Suddenly a loud crash echoed from the kitchen. A pan had fallen to the floor. No one moved and no one spoke. The kitchen remained dark.

When the waitress returned with the bill, she said nothing about it. She bowed as usual, but I noticed her hand shaking slightly.

We paid quickly and left. As the sliding door closed behind us, the light above the entrance flickered once.

Later I tried to learn more about the rumors. I discovered that about fifty years ago, the owner of the restaurant had a violent quarrel with his wife. He struck her, not realizing she was pregnant. The baby was lost. The woman's mind gave way after that. Some time later she killed him in the restaurant's kitchen.

It is said that the man still lingers in the dining room, and the woman remains in the kitchen, waiting for the one who took her child.

When I think back to the tap on my shoulder and the chopsticks falling from the empty table, I cannot help wondering which one of them it was...

"Did They Fade, Or Do They Remain?",Japan,Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: Did They Fade, Or Do They Remain?

I live in Hokkaido, and my yard used to have an old well. It had been there long before I moved in, tucked away behind shrubs and an aging shed. I rarely used it, maybe only only once in a while for watering plants? But otherwise it sat quietly, almost forgotten.

The area where I live has long had a reputation for being haunted. Over the years I've grown used to it. Sometimes, in the middle of the night, faint voices can be heard, like distant prayers carried on the wind. They've weakened as time has passed, and I've come to accept them as part of the atmosphere here.

But what happened when I arranged to close the well felt entirely different.

In the days leading up to the ceremony, strange things began to occur. At night, dogs from far-off homes barked and howled in the direction of my property, though there was nothing visible in the yard. Inside my own house, I would wake to muffled knocking sounds, low and insistent, as though coming from beneath the ground.

The night before the priest was due to arrive, I saw something I still can't explain. At dusk, I noticed a shape near the well. At first it looked like an animal crouched close to the ground, but as I focused on it, the form seemed to stretch upward, taking on the blurred outline of a person. It never came into focus... Always shadowy, indistinct... Before vanishing altogether. When I went to check, the ground around the stones was damp, though it hadn't rained in days.

On the morning of the ceremony, the air in the yard felt unusually heavy, as though the place itself was holding its breath. The priest performed the purification, but later admitted it had been harder than usual, as if something resisted the prayers.

When the ritual was finished and the well was sealed, the disturbances ceased. The dogs grew quiet, the knocking sounds never returned, and I haven't seen that shadowy figure again.

Even so, the memory lingers. The distant prayers that sometimes drift through my area feel familiar now, almost harmless. But the things I experienced during the well-closing were different... Very active, immediate, and unsettling in a way I won't soon forget.

Do you think the spirits tied to the well are still here, or did they fade away like the voices of those midnight prayers?

A Haunted Well,India,Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: A Haunted Well

"" This is something that happened to my mother around 45 - 50 years ago...""

During her childhood, my mother used to spend her summer holidays in a small village called Naginenipally, at her eldest sister-in-law's house. Like most children of her age, she was playful, curious, and a little adventurous.

In that village, there was an old well that everyone whispered about. The elders often warned children to stay away from it, saying it was haunted. Naturally, this only fueled the curiosity of the kids.

One day, when all the elders were busy with work, my mother and her close friend slipped away to see the well for themselves. They played around it for some time. Neither of them knew how to swim, so they never dared to get too close. But then something terrifying happened.

Out of nowhere, a woman draped in a black saree appeared. She was carrying burning coal wrapped in her saree, yet the cloth did not catch fire. With a swift motion, she threw the burning coal in front of the children. Shocked and terrified, the two girls ran back to the house, trembling with fear.

Days later, despite the incident, their curiosity got the better of them. They returned to the well. But this time, what they experienced was even more chilling.

From deep inside the well, they began to hear a voice calling out the name of my mother's friend. At first faint, it grew louder and louder, echoing through the air until it felt unbearably close.

The girls fled in horror. That very night, my mother's friend developed a high fever. Even as she lay in her home, she claimed to hear the same voice calling her name again and again.

Though her fever eventually subsided, she never recovered from the fear. Within a few days... She passed away.

I Would Have Been Late,Canada,Family / Friends Visits,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Family / Friends Visits :: I Would Have Been Late

M y Mother passed away in April 2022, though I have been thinking to share the interesting events that happened around that trying time, today I'm going to write about a little help she gave me this morning.

Today I had to go to work to a place a bit far from where I live and one of my coworkers was to pick me up at 6:00 AM.

Since this is way too early for the time I usually get up, I decided to sleep in my daughter's bedroom so not to disturb my husband's sleep. I prepared my stuff and a good lunch and set the alarm with enough time to let me get ready, have a good breakfast and tend to the cat's needs before leaving, I thought one hour and 20 minutes would be enough time to do everything without rushing.

Anyway, at some point I had a dream, perhaps even a nightmare, in which I was going to get together with my friends from university, they arrived at my place and I wasn't ready. I began looking for something to wear but couldn't find anything suitable, mismatched socks, flowery blouses and plaid skirts and homely dresses that would had made me look like a pauper beside my elegantly dressed friends.

I went out and told my friends that I'd be ready in two minutes, but was moving with the speed of a snail and knew I would make everyone else late for whatever event we were attending.

My parents were watching me from the background, and Mom said ""Se te va a hacer tarde"" (You are going to be late).

Hearing her voice was enough to wake me up startled, I checked my phone, it was 4:23 AM, still a bit earlier than the time I had set the alarm. I stayed few more minutes in bed but decided to turn off the alarm and get up. To my horror, I realized that I had set the alarm at 5:40 AM instead of 4:40 as I had intended!

Strange Voices In The Mountains,Japan,Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: Strange Voices In The Mountains

I went camping for two nights at a small site up in the mountains, next to a slow-moving stream. The water ran clear over stones, and deer wandered through the area occasionally, which is normal in Hokkaido. The air smelled damp and earthy, with a faint hint of pine.

I rode up on my side-car. The road was quiet, and the forest on either side felt still, but the ride itself was normal.

The first night was uneventful. I heard only the stream, the occasional rustle of leaves, and a few distant birds.

The second night was different. I woke sometime after midnight because the forest felt unusually still. The stream was quieter, and then I heard voices.

At first, they were faint, blending with the water. But it was clear they were human voices, not animal sounds. One voice, soft and high-pitched, sounded like a woman speaking in short, broken phrases. It drifted slowly through the area, fading in and out. I stayed still and listened. After a few minutes, the voices faded completely, leaving only the stream.

When I was leaving the next morning, I mentioned it to the caretaker. He didn't look surprised. He said quietly that people sometimes hear things in that part of the mountain, and that in the past, a few people have gone missing there. He didn't give any details, and I didn't ask.

I don't know what I heard that night. Maybe it was someone lost, maybe it was just the way sound carries in the forest. But the voices by the stream have stayed with me. What do you think those voices are? Are they victims or some sort of night creatures?

"Move To San Francisco, A Very Haunted City","California, United States",Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: Move To San Francisco, A Very Haunted City

O oookay, I was totally joking at the end of my last post when I said I'd post again in five years. But here it is, five years later. Looks like I'm going to be unintentionally posting every five years on here.

On 29 June 2021, I moved to San Francisco. It's where I'd always wanted to move, but couldn't for various reasons. Well, a really good friend of mine told me that I could live with them. They lived with their family and their family said I could stay until the end of the year, then I'd have to find my own place. That seemed perfectly fair.

In 2017, their grandmother passed away. I always assumed she passed away in the hospital because I remembered my friend telling me they rushed her to the hospital, and a few days later they told me she passed. But every time I was by the bathroom in front of her old room, I'd get this strange feeling there was a presence. That little hallway had that feeling. It didn't feel evil or scary, it actually felt calming. I told my friend, and they said, ""That's Baachan. She's watching over us"". My friend is Japanese and that's the term they call their grandmother. I asked if she passed in the hospital like I thought, and they said, ""No, she hated it there. We brought her home to rest in her own bed, and she passed away that night"".

However, the basement was another story. Or rather... First floor? Basements are weird here in San Francisco. In their house and the one I'm currently living, there are steps leading to second floor, which acts as the first floor. The ground floor is considered a basement even though it's fully above ground. I've lived here four years, and I'm still confused by it. I live on the third floor but it's technically the second floor...

Anyway, we had to go to the basement to do laundry. We never liked being down there because the air felt thick and evil. My friend's family had bought the house back in the 1950s and their mother had grown up in it, and she told me it was like that when she was a little girl. She hated being down there and doesn't go down there unless she has to. I asked if something happened down there and she said if it did it was before her family bought the house, but it definitely feels like some really bad energy is down there.

So, I got a job there, saved up and moved into my current house on 5 January 2022. I'm renting a room in a house, and it's a really nice neighbourhood in the Richmond. That's not doxing myself, the Richmond is fifty blocks long and like ten blocks wide. It's a very big area.

It didn't take me long to notice that the house was haunted. At least the hallway. Even in the daytime I feel like something is chasing me when I walk down it and I rush back to my room. A friend of mine looked up this address on SF Chronicles archives and found out there had been a murder here in the '80s. There weren't any specific details like if it was in the top floor hallway or something. But that's the only thing we found that could explain it.

There are four rooms on my floor. My room is at the end of the hall facing the outside. I look out my window and see the street. The room next to mine, there was someone living there when I moved out. He moved out a year into me living here and someone else moved in, he's still here. The room at the end of the hall, the same person has lived there since before I moved in. I mention all this to talk about the last room. I call it the middle room even though there are four rooms. I guess it'd be the middle room in that hall, since mine is at the end of the hall. Anyway, I've always called it the cursed room. The guy who was living there when I moved in moved out a month later. In the three and a half years I've lived in this house, we've had six different people move in and out. The short time was two weeks. I came home from work and he was moving his stuff out. I asked what was going on and he just said, ""I can't do this anymore"". I asked what he meant and he just repeated it. The current tenant there seems to be paranoid. When he moved in a couple months ago, he told me that he had to move out of his last place because his landlord was having the tenants spy on him. I was like, ""Oh, that's messed up!"". But then he started talking about hidden cameras in his room and I felt like maybe his last landlord didn't have him spied on. A couple weeks ago I was coming up the stairs from taking out the trash. His room is directly in front of the stairs, and as I was nearing the top, he opened his door and told me I needed to stop standing outside his door listening in. I was confused and he said, ""Don't bother denying it, I caught you three times"". The other way I was coming up the stairs from talking with a friend at the front door who had come to pick up something. As I was nearing the top he threw open his door and startled me. I laughed and told him he startled me. He goes, ""I told you to stay out of my room! You need to leave me alone!"". Honestly, I don't know if that has anything to do with the activity here or if he's just mentally ill, but I honestly wouldn't be surprised if there was a presence outside his room and he thinks it's one of us.

Something happened a couple of days ago that made me want to write all this down. Our bathroom is split between two rooms. Okay, from my room looking down the hall, on the left side are my roommates' rooms. On the left side is an empty closet, the stairs, and the two bathroom doors, and the kitchen at the end of the hall. The first bathroom is literally just the toilet, the size of a porta-potty. Really tiny. The second door is the shower and sink. It sounds inconvenient, but with four people living there, it's been very convenient. Anyway, a couple days ago I was in the first bathroom and I could hear someone taking a shower. I could see the light on, and the windows were open and I could very clearly hear the shower going. I was thinking to myself, ""I'll just wash my hands in the kitchen"", like we usually do in that situation. Well, I leave the bathroom, the sound still going and light still on through the window, and when I close the door behind me... The second bathroom door is open, and the light is off and no one is in there. No shower going, the floor and walls are dry. I stood there, my blood frozen. It was seriously eerie.

Okay, that's enough about my living haunting situations. I'll talk about my San Francisco working haunting situations. That's a weird wording, but I'm going to keep it.

First job I got was on Fisherman's Wharf at a souvenir shop standing outside going, ""Everything is $10!"". That was literally my entire job. That's the job that paid for me to move out of my friend's house. But a week after I moved into this house, the store abruptly closed. I frantically looked for another one and was lucky enough to find one with one day left in the month. My landlord is very understanding. It was an organic market on Polk, and I loved it there. A lot of the friends I have made here were either coworkers there or regular customers there. A minor celebrity was a regular there and she and I talked every week. It was so much fun working there! Even if it was haunted like crazy! There was the obvious stuff like stuff falling off shelves that weren't near the edge, stuff moving around or not where we left them. There were times we saw figures cross between aisles even though we knew no one else was in the store. I even had a similar experience that happened in Ohio. A coworker and I were discussing the hauntings, and a loaf of bread flew off the shelf and hit the counter. We decided to change the subject. The same thing happened in Ohio except it was a bag of chips.

In 2023 the store was bought by another, bigger store and closed down and we were all let go. I had saved up thousands of dollars by then, which was lucky because that paid my rent until I got another job in March 2024. My current job, in fact. I'm a photographer at a landmark. Obviously not going to say which one. We take pictures of guests as they enter and try to sell them souvenir sets of their photos as they leave. We all know the area is haunted, but it's hard to prove because we're outside. We just know mostly because we can feel it. There were two incidents that really solidified it, though. Several months ago, I opened up (I'm a lead there) and when I unlocked the office there were photo cards everywhere. I called the person who closed the night before and asked them what the heck happened. He was completely confused; it wasn't like that when he left. I knew he was lying so I had to report it to my district manager. An hour later she texted me a video showing that... It wasn't him. Oh, the photo cards are cards with QR codes we scan when we take the pictures and hand to the guests. There are 1,000 in each box. Anyway, there was an open box on the table in the office and in the middle of the night, they started flying out of the box of their own accord. I asked her if I could share the video and she said absolutely not. What's with corporate not wanting these things getting out? Honestly, I think that'd give us more visitors.

The other thing that happened was we often hear our names called from behind the sales area. There will be no one over there and one of us will hear our name being called from back there. No one else can hear it, but almost all of us have heard it. Even the skeptical ones have heard it, though they have tried to dismiss it as the wind. But it even happens when the wind isn't blowing, or even no breeze. The air could be still and we'll still hear it. It's always eerie. I've been working there for a year and a half and have heard it many times and am not used to it. We had a sixteen-year-old girl start working there last year. I was standing next to her on her first night and she suddenly screamed. I jumped and asked what happened. She said, ""I heard someone saying my name!"" and she ran behind the sales area and screamed again because no one was back there. I involuntarily laughed and said, ""Oh, you'll get used to that"", even though like I said I'm still not used to it. Needless to say, she quit after about a week. She said it was because she hated working outside, though.

I'm going to end this by talking about something nobody likes talking about. I've walked the Golden Gate Bridge so many times now that I don't even take pictures every time anymore. It's just a large bridge that just happens to be one of the most famous in the world. No big deal. But as I'm sure everyone knows, it's well-known for the unfortunately high number of people who have jumped off of it over the course of its existence. I don't know if you've walked on it, but you can definitely feel it when you're walking on it. There's an air of sadness when you're walking across it. No matter what I'm doing, be it listening to happy music or in a call with my best friend, there's an unmistakable feeling of sadness, dread, and regret when walking on that bridge. I've never specifically seen anything, but I think it's because I'm kind of sensitive to that sort of thing that I feel it so much. I've walked it with a friend of mine once who isn't sensitive to the paranormal and she didn't feel anything. Heck, at this point, I don't even know if what I feel on the bridge is even paranormal anymore. There's been so many jumpers over the past century, those emotions are essentially baked in by now. They have nets in place now so there have been less attempts lately. Someone did jump a couple months ago. I saw him lying on the net refusing help. Last I saw, they were guiding him off. So, the nets are definitely saving lives. Either as a deterrent or by literally catching people who try.

Is Someone Visiting?,"Texas, United States",Family / Friends Visits,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Family / Friends Visits :: Is Someone Visiting?

I t has been a VERY LONG time since I have visited YGS and had someone not reached out to me via FB I am not sure I would have returned, but here I am and a BIG thank you to the individual who reached out to me.

2024 was not a good year for myself or Family. In January we saw the passing of my Mother. Her health had been in decline (heart issues) and was in assisted living in the Dallas Tx area. In May we received the 'midnight' phone call that wakes you from your peace. My Oldest Son (Lawrence) had collapsed at work, he worked 3rd shift (overnights) at a Local Floor and Decor, and was pronounced dead at the scene. He had suffered a Bi-lateral pulmonary embolism. My Father -in-Law, who's health was failing (Type 1 Diabetes Complications) moved in us in June, by the first week of August he was placed on Home Hospice and passed away later that same month (yes, he passed in my house).

In the year since, some 'odd' things have happened either to individuals in the household or with-in the house itself.

1st: When home alone I hear someone moving upstairs in my Son's old room. I 'played' it off as it being our dog (a 13-14 year old 50-60 pound Huskey with a bad hip) only to realize he was at my feet as I sat on the couch. A quick 'cat check' shows that both of out cats are also in the living room with me.

2nd: Each Family member has felt Lawrence's presence at one time or another, up to and including hearing his voice saying something... Not sure if this is just us remembering how he would speak with us or if he is actually interacting with us still, but it's defiantly his 'sarcastic' / snarky type comments.

3rd: Not sure how people feel about seeing individuals that have crossed over in their dreams, but my Wife has had two very vivid dreams about Lawrence, she describes them as 'feeling' real. The first one he was comforting her because he had passed away, he assured her that 'he was needed' on the other side... The next day is when we received the coroner's report detailing what had caused his death... A pulmonary embolism, is enough to take someone, he had suffered a Bi-Lateral (one in both Lungs) Pulmonary Embolism and there was nothing that could have been done to prevent it. The other dream she described was 'just as real' but he was simply comforting her, at least that's all she could remember about it.

So, there it is... 2024 was a very rough year for our Family, still dealing with so, so many things from last year, but making progress. Thanks for reading.

Am I Losing The Plot?,United Kingdom,Misc,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Misc :: Am I Losing The Plot?

A t the end of May this year, I lost my umbrella. This fact had me very confused as I do not use my umbrella very much, and usually use it to walk to the gym when it's raining. Just as info, I have zero psychic ability. None. But I have been reading stories on YGS for over 10 years as I find the subject interesting.

I looked everywhere for this umbrella. I live in a Victorian terrace with limited space so there are a finite number of places to look. I even went to my car and checked in there. On the back seat of my car, behind the driver, I keep two cloth shopping bags and I moved them out of the way to look at the back seat (even though I can't imagine why I would put it on the back seat) but I saw nothing. Each week these 2 bags would be used and returned to the same spot. Shortly before I was due to go on holiday the 3rd week of June, I returned my bags to the back seat and there sat my umbrella. I was quite nonplussed. I was sure that I had carefully looked at the back seat weeks before. I park as close to my front door as I am able because parking is first come first served.

I got back from my holiday, and on June 3rd I was making something to eat, and reached into a lower cupboard for a can of baked beans. I always have baked beans - they are a staple. My hand grabbed air. I bent down to have a look, stuck my hand into the space where there should have been cans, put my arm all the way to the back and zilch. No beans. I was really surprised that I had run out as I hate running out of anything. Next day when I did some shopping I bought a couple of cans to go in the cupboard. When I tried to insert the new cans I heard a clink. I looked into the cupboard and there were two cans of beans there. As you can imagine, I was beginning to wonder if I was losing the plot.

On the 10th of July (and this is where I went back and wrote dates down) I took a bus to meet someone for coffee in a town about 3 miles away. While I was on the bus I looked at my hands and noticed that I had not put on my rings and bangle. A few months ago I realized that I really should wear my jewelery more as it was silly to leave it in the jewelry box, so I had two rings resized and started wearing them more. The only problem is that at times the rings and bangle get really annoying. When home, I often put them on my computer desk and put them on from there before I go out. If they annoy me when I am out I pull them off, and slip them into the front zip pocket of my shoulder bag. I thought about when I had last seen the jewelry and could not remember seeing the pieces by the pc before I left, so I thought that perhaps I had forgotten to take them out of my handbag after the last time I wore them. I unzipped the front pouch, which is probably about 25cm x 20cm, slid my hand back and forth and resolved to look for the rings and bangle when I got home as the pocket was empty. Had my coffee, got on the bus to go home and started to put my bus pass into the front zip pocket. As soon as I slipped my hand in, I felt my bangle which is gold and fairly heavy and noticeable, and the rings were there too.

After the beans incident I had started to wonder if I had a spirit in my home with me, and the jewelry incident really reinforced that thought except for one thing. I was a couple of miles from home when I found the empty pocket, and about 3 miles away from home when I could feel my stuff again. And this is where I really started to wonder if I was losing it. How did ""my"" spirit know that I would be looking for my jewelry on the bus, and how did it put it back in for me when I was not at home? Can these entities move around with you?

I have been meaning to set up an account here, but I am a great procrastinator. Yesterday I was sitting in my recliner for a few minutes before going out. I had been ready to post everything after I set up an account, but I procrastinated for a couple of weeks, and then yesterday something new happened. I leave my Kindle Fire on the arm of my recliner. It was unplugged and to my left while I checked something out before leaving. I looked over and it turned on. Now, if there is no power plugged in, I must hold the power button to a 5 count before it turns on, so somebody was trying to be helpful, which it would have been if not for the fact I was going out.

I am of an age where quite a few people have Alzheimers and/or dementia, and I really would rather not join that group, so if someone with more knowledge than me would care to comment on the question of can spirits follow you around locally, I would be relieved if some do and that I am still sane.

A Shadow In The Forest,Japan,Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: A Shadow In The Forest

I have lived in Hokkaido for ten years. A few days before the event, I visited Nibutani, a village where the Ainu people preserve their culture and traditions. An elder told me about Ke-saru, a spirit said to live deep in the forest and watch those who enter.

He explained,""Ke-saru doesn't chase people, but it watches carefully. If someone is careless or disrespectful, it takes more than just fear.""

The name Ke-saru means""face peeler""in the Ainu language, referring to the spirit's dangerous nature toward those who show arrogance or disrespect in the forest.

Before I left, the elder taught me a prayer to say if I ever felt the spirit nearby,""Kamuy ceppesuy."" This means,""Spirit, please return to your home."" The Ainu believe that spirits called kamuy live in all parts of nature, animals, plants, rivers, and the wind.

While hiking alone in the Hidaka Mountains, the air suddenly became cold. All birds singing, wind rustling leaves stopped completely. Then, I saw a dark shape moving slowly between the trees. It was too large and moved too quietly to be a bear or any animal I know around.

At that moment, I felt a heavy pressure and had difficulty breathing. Remembering the elder's words, I whispered the prayer,""Kamuy ceppesuy.""

For several seconds, the Shadow stayed still before silently disappearing into the darkness.

When I returned to Nibutani and told the elder what happened, he said, ""It saw you. You are lucky it let you go.""

Since then, I have avoided walking alone in that part of the forest. The silence and shadows are not just empty, they feel like something is watching.

Did I encounter the Ke-saru or can anyone explain what happened?

Spirits From Ripley's,"Florida, United States",Ghost Tours & Haunted Hotels,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Ghost Tours & Haunted Hotels :: Spirits From Ripley's

R ipley's Believe It Or Not seems to have more than just artifacts from different locations around the world. Some seem to be there from the Paranormal Realm, which I had the opportunity to investigate and experience.

Just like at the Old Jail, you go through a little bit of an introduction, a run over of the gear that they have to let you use, then you are released to investigate the building. I was not expecting all the activity that we had the opportunity to witness, and it definitely itched the scratch of wanting to get some interactions to see if there was paranormal activity.

This location gave more EVP evidence than anything else. Which part of it was receiving the name Steve a few times. Then there was a time frame where it said ""switch"", which I was there with a friend, and asked if it wanted me to hand the spirit box to my friend, which we received the response ""yes"" and it then proceeded to whistle at him a few times.

At this location, we were not receiving very many spirit orbs, but was a lot more heavy on the Voice Phenomena when we were asking questions. Now the one time that I had some concern was mentioning that I was going to go downstairs, and got a very heavy, deep, angry sounding NO! Response through the spirit box, which, much to say, I did not go downstairs at that point.

Then towards the end of the investigation, we were standing in one of the exhibits and received the response ""Die"" or ""Will Die"" and at that point my buddy as well as myself were like, nope we are stepping out of this room and going elsewhere.

Either way, that was my first investigation before doing the Old Jail investigation and hope that you guys enjoyed reading this.

Ghosts Of The Old Jail,"Florida, United States",Ghost Tours & Haunted Hotels,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Ghost Tours & Haunted Hotels :: Ghosts Of The Old Jail

I figured I would share a story of one of the experiences that I have had in my life, that I feel like was the most interesting encounters that I have had to this day.

A friend and myself had gone to St. Augustine in Florida, and while there, noticed that the old jail had these paranormal investigations that you could pay to go on at night. Now to start it out, they didn't give too long in there. If I remember correctly you would be allowed to investigate on your own, but after receiving a short introduction and a quick run through of the equipment that they would let you use while there. All together I think we were allowed like 30-45 minutes for the investigation after all the intro and run through with the equipment was done.

But this was my second time doing an investigation, and the whole time they were doing the introductions outside, I could feel some eyes on me from inside the old jail. I remember it was the second floor off to the left side as you look at the Old Jail from outside. Then when we walked inside, we were able to get our hands on some equipment and investigate.

So we started out in the kitchen, and were not really receiving anything there, and proceeded to move over to the cells and see what was out there. Which we didn't really receive anything there, and proceeded to go to the Solitary Confinement Cells. That is where the real stuff kicked off. We didn't capture any EVP's but we did receive spirit orbs (which I had caught on camera) and there was a point when I captured the sounds of feet shuffling on camera.

Now with that, we kept getting spirit orbs every time when we would mention the sheriff, and then we went up to where the sheriff lived when he was over the prison, and caught more spirit orbs as well. When we were checking around in there, I had stepped to the side and received a tug on my shirt, which kind of startled me.

That was one of two investigations that was done in St. Augustine and will be writing the story of the other investigation that we had done, and would love to share that story with you guys as well. Also in regards to the story, if there is interest in seeing the video footage from the old jail, I have those uploaded on my YouTube channel, and can share that link with those that are interested in it.

"Visiting Shaft No. 4, An Old Coal Mine In Hokkaido",Japan,Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: Visiting Shaft No. 4, An Old Coal Mine In Hokkaido

I recently visited an old coal mine near Yubari called Shaft No. 4. It closed many years ago and is now abandoned.

The rusty gate at the entrance was cut open. I took a flashlight and walked inside. The air was cooler and damp, smelling like earth and rust. The tunnel walls were rough stone, and my flashlight only lit a small part ahead.

It was very quiet except for my footsteps. After a while, the air got colder. I could see my breath even though it wasn't cold outside. Then I heard some soft tapping sounds coming from deeper in the tunnel where I couldn't see.

The tapping didn't sound natural. It was like someone walking carefully. I stopped and listened, but the tapping stopped after a few seconds. It felt like something might have been there, just out of sight.

After that, I thought I heard faint whispers, but I couldn't make out any words. It was a quiet sound, and it felt like a warning to leave.

A sudden chill ran through me, and I felt uneasy. When I turned to head back, I saw a shadow move quickly along the wall. I shined my flashlight there, but there was nothing. The darkness seemed deeper than before.

Outside, the sun was setting, but the cold feeling and quietness stayed with me. The usual sounds felt far away.

Even now, I think about that visit. It feels like the miners who worked and died there left a presence behind, a quiet feeling in the cold tunnels.

Visiting abandoned mines can be dangerous. The tunnels may collapse, and the air might be poor. If you go, bring a friend, wear boots and a helmet, carry a flashlight with extra batteries, and tell someone where you're going. Be careful and respect the place and its history.

Yubari was once a busy coal mining town from the early 1900s to the 1960s. Mining was difficult work, and many miners lost their lives underground. When coal demand dropped, the mines closed, and towns like Yubari became empty.

Visiting Shaft No. 4 connects me to that history. It also reminds me that some memories don't fully go away even in dark tunnels.

Encounter Of A Spirit Of A Spider?,Japan,Pets / Animals,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Pets / Animals :: Encounter Of A Spirit Of A Spider?

I had a dream. In it, I was in my hobby room where I keep all my tarantulas. Everything looked exactly the same as in real life, the shelves, the lighting, the soft hum of the air, the subtle warmth. It felt ordinary. But the silence carried a strange weight.

That's when I saw my oldest tarantula. The one who had passed some time ago. She didn't move, but somehow, her thoughts reached into me.

And yet I knew exactly who she meant. The Singaporean Blue. A beautiful spider I had planned to ship out the next morning.

In the dream, I didn't question how I knew, it just made sense. Her message didn't need to be spoken aloud.

I wanted to respond, but I knew I couldn't. Even within the dream, I understood this was a one-way message. I was only meant to receive.

When I woke up, sunlight filled the room. My packaging table was ready, the materials laid out neatly. I was supposed to ship the Singaporean Blue that very day. But the dream lingered.

And there she was. Curled gently around an egg sac. Quietly guarding it, protecting it.

If I had shipped her that day, the eggs might've been lost. She might have been harmed. I cancelled the shipment immediately and called my friend to explain. Thankfully, he understood.

I'm not claiming it was a ghost or something supernatural. But the dream gave me something I had no way of knowing. It changed what I did.

So if something speaks to you in a dream, gives you a message you couldn't have known otherwise, and alters your path, doesn't that make it an encounter? I don't know for sure. But I'm grateful I listened.

Hug Goodbye,Australia,Family / Friends Visits,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Family / Friends Visits :: Hug Goodbye

Y esterday an old friend of the family passed away. V didn't want anyone visiting toward the end, only her immediate family. I wanted so badly to spend more time with her but I respected her wishes.

About a year ago I knew something was wrong with her; it was a gut feeling and nothing more. As the months went by I dreamt about her a lot. In most of these dreams I'm standing on the road outside her house. I know I can't get in and I don't try. They're sad dreams. In one dream I find a path beside one of the front gates. I enter through this path, it leads me to their house. But the house isn't there, it's like it was never built and I can't find my way out again. All dreams are in daylight.

I never asked V if she was okay or if she was ill. A part of me knew not to and another part of me didn't want to know. She's never been the best when it comes to doctors and conversations relating to medical topics always fall flat.

About ten years ago V had another medical scare but came out without a scratch. With little to no medical treatment. She really thought she'd live forever and so did everyone else if we're honest.

Last night I was at home tidying up. While I was dusting a desk I felt V suddenly behind me. It was such a strong feeling and I could see her in my mind stood behind me. I didn't turn around but I said her name and the feeling got stronger still. I could see clearly in my mind how she was standing, what she was wearing, how her hair was styled, everything. In my mind I could see her touching my shoulders in a half hug, way you do when you're comforting someone. When V touched my shoulders there was such an intense unmistakable feeling of her being right there. After a moment I shook the feeling off and walked away because I didn't want this to be what I believed it to be. Wish I hadn't done that.

Last night I kept dreaming of V. Just random stuff like sitting in their kitchen chatting, their dogs being rowdy. One dream was of one of her lampshades which she made for me when I was a wee lass. I have it sitting out ready for an old lamp that needs rewiring.

Today I got the call that she had passed away. I don't know what time it happened, only that it happened yesterday.

While I was on the phone the call kept going into static sounds. At one point the phone beeped a long kind of 'beep' sound. Never heard my phone make that noise. I was talking to my dad, who informed me. The paranormal is a no go topic for him so I didn't bring it up, not sure if he heard anything on his end.

I know it sounds cliché but V's always been an inspiration to me. In that she's always been unapologetically herself. Her passion for antique everything was completely unmatched and her home was the most haunted place I've ever known. I wrote about their ghosties years ago on here. The eccentric couple with the big ole posh place.

V was born into extreme wealth but was a hippy and artist at heart. Never worked a day in her life. Dedicated much of her time to helping others. She was so generous with people, often times to her own detriment. She would often have people in need live with her, usually recovering addicts. Which was often dangerous as V and her husband are big into recreational substances. It usually ended badly, very badly. V was beaten up a few times by some of the people she took in. Her heart was always in the right place but she could be very naive.

I don't think it's completely sunk in yet. I thought writing about last night would make me feel something but I'm kind of just numb.

On a slightly unrelated note about a year ago I was watching a horror on Netflix. In this movie someone holds a duck out from around a doorway or around a corner or something. It's a white duck and someone holds it out so it's like looking at you from the doorway. It's a silly quirky scene but it scared the bejesus out of me. For anyone who may remember, when I wrote about V's place years ago I wrote about a duck puppet that stuck its head around the doorway when we were kids. I thought V's daughter had done this and ran towards the puppet but nothing was there. So, did someone from Netflix read that or what?

The Haunting Of Willows Apartments,"Nebraska, United States",Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: The Haunting Of Willows Apartments

I 'm here to talk about my experiences as a kid in the Willows Apartments. I'm not sure why no one talks about them much, but that place is hell.

When I was just 9-10 years old, I had a very bad experience and very negative. My mom had stayed here when we moved in, I knew something was badly off. I started noticing it when mom would get angry more and easier. I knew being a single parent was bad enough and ever since I was a kid, I'm a magnet for spirits and demonic entities. It's terrifying when you're just a kid.

It started off when moms' emotions would increase, the smallest things could set her off. I could understand why maybe it was stress until... That quickly changed. Started to hear footsteps at night, knockings, slamming kitchen cabinets would wake me up. I thought it was mom, but I would get up and to find her always fast asleep.

One day a childhood friend of mine came to stay the night little did I know that was the last night we stayed there; we encountered evil. My friend and I were in the bedroom playing with toys, when all the sudden I saw a shadow dark run across the wall. I pointed at it and asking her did you see that she looked at me in fear like she saw the whole thing not just a shadow. I screamed for my mom, tears down my face, ""I saw it! I saw a shadow!""

My mom saw my fear and felt it. She contacted her close friend and we cleansed what we could of out apartment and never looked back.

Later that week mom found out that the buildings were built on very bad Indian burial ground, many deaths followed, and the apartments continue to haunt the living to this day.

Unexpected Messages From Loved Ones,"Georgia, United States",Photographs / Videos / EVP,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Photographs / Videos / EVP :: Unexpected Messages From Loved Ones

I t's been a longtime away from the site, just busy but I'm now officially an empty nester and had some extra time to catch up with you all here.

I wanted to document two recent instances of EVPs that just happened unexpectedly, plus something related to the empty nester thing.

First, I was videoing some birds gathering in a tree in my back yard in early spring. They were making a ton of noise eating on the berries and I thought to send the video to my husband at work so walked out to record them. On the way back inside, as it was cold, I yet again didn't tap the off button properly to turn off the video recording (I'm so bad with my phone) so ended up with footage of the birds and the ground as I was walking back inside. But upon playback, as I'm crossing the patio, one can hear a fairly obvious EVP of a voice saying, ""OOH RAH,"" which is what U.S. Marines say... All the dang time. My late husband Scott was a Marine (as is my current husband). If current husband had been in the house, I might conclude the voice was his, but this morning he was already AT WORK. I can't imagine any of my elderly neighbors hollering like a Marine, so I'm left thinking it was Scott, yet again finding a way to be heard on a random day. He died from brain cancer in 1993 at age 32.

Then, last week, went to visit family graves at the cemetery where my aunt was recently interred. Scott's plot is just across the small interior street from my mom's. You can stand at mom's grave and see his and vice versa. Anyway, I decided to record as I walked up, because last time I was there I got an EVP. This visit, a woman's voice on video says, ""It's a woman"" as I'm walking to the gravesite. I stand there a minute and look over to Scott's grave and pretty sure there was a tear falling as I walked back down a slight hill to my car. The same woman's voice says, ""It's ok"" on my video recording. Easily heard, much appreciated.

Finally, Mom had given me a silver bracelet at the time of her diagnoses with cancer in 2013. I'm not much for jewelry, but I wore this bracelet every day. Sometime at the beginning of the covid lockdown, I lost it. Obviously not going anywhere, but it just sort of disappeared and over the last four years I've looked everywhere and yes, it did cross my mind that it was significantly from my mom.

Well, I have four kids and the last of them graduated from high school this spring. I've been raising kids 36 years and am 64 now, so it's going to be great as these last two finish college and join their siblings in adulthood. We had a large graduation party and that day I went into the closet where Mom's china (she left me) is kept to get a platter. I had to move a silver gravy boat out of the way to get to it and guess what just happened to be in the gravy boat? Right -- Mom's silver bracelet! Found on the day of the last kid's graduation, an occasion I know Mom would've loved. There is NO reason for that bracelet to have been there these last four years! I can't help but think it was yet another message from Mom.

The Cry In The Tunnel,China,Ghost Tours & Haunted Hotels,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Ghost Tours & Haunted Hotels :: The Cry In The Tunnel

A few years ago, I visited Harbin during the coldest part of winter.

The city was covered in deep snow, and the air was sharp and dry.

Walking through the streets, everything felt quiet and still - a kind of stillness that comes with extreme cold.

I had come as a tourist, interested in both the city's architecture and its history.

One site in particular stood out on the map: the Unit 731 Museum.

Unit 731 was a former covert military facility operated by the Imperial Japanese Army during World War II.

It served as a research base for biological warfare. Inside, human experiments were conducted (studies on frostbite, intentional infection with disease, and live vivisections.)

Thousands of people, many of them civilians and prisoners of war, died as a result.

The lighting is dim, and many areas of the building have been left in their original condition.

The displays include photos, documents, and preserved medical tools.

At one point, a guide pointed to a stairway leading underground and said,

""That tunnel leads to the prisoner cells. You may go down alone if you'd like.""

The tunnel was narrow, the walls damp. The air was colder than above.

Water dripped steadily from the ceiling, and the passage echoed faintly with each step.

Continuing forward, I heard another sound... Faint, possibly a voice.

It resembled a quiet whisper, unclear""Ahma."" (probably mother in Chinese)

Then I heard what sounded like a slow exhale close to my ear.

Back in the main building, I told a staff about what I had experienced.

She said, ""Many people hear things in that tunnel. Some things stay, even when they're gone.""

Though I don't claim to understand what I heard or felt, the visit to Unit 731 left an impression, not through horror or theatrics, but through the weight of documented history and preserved space.

It is a reminder of what human beings are capable of and why some places should be preserved, not forgotten.

The 3 A.m. Sleep Paralysis And Vivid Dreams,India,Old Hags / Night Attacks / Sleep Paralysis,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Old Hags / Night Attacks / Sleep Paralysis :: The 3 A.m. Sleep Paralysis And Vivid Dreams

The story is of my best friend. Let's call him Kapil. I am an eye witness of this.

This all happened during the lockdown in 2021. Kapil, my best friend, had been telling me about these really vivid and scary dreams he was having, always between 2 and 3 AM. He also mentioned experiencing sleep paralysis.

One day, with our exams approaching, I went over to his place for a night study session. It got pretty late, and around 1 AM, we decided to call it a night and get some sleep. We were sleeping in the same room, but our beds were on opposite walls.

Around 3 AM, I was jolted awake by a faint rustling sound. I sat up in my bed, and when my eyes landed on Kapil, a chill shot down my spine. He was thrashing, desperately trying to move, but couldn't, and his eyes were wide open. I immediately knew it was sleep paralysis.

Without thinking, I grabbed my water bottle and sprinkled a few drops on his face. It worked! He snapped out of it. But just as he did, we both heard it - the distinct sound of a plate dropping in the kitchen.

We were both instantly terrified. Neither of us dared to go check it out. Then, to our horror, the same sound came again. We just stayed frozen in our beds, listening.

After a few tense moments, we both started to relax a bit. I asked Kapil what had happened to him. He whispered that a ""totally black shadow"" had come and sat on his chest. He said he tried desperately to scream or even move his hands, but he couldn't. It was a truly terrible night for us.

After that night, I never tried to sleep at his home again. Kapil later told me that he continued to experience such incidents. Now he's in the UK, so I don't talk to him as much about it, but that night is something I'll never forget.

A Bizarre Encounter At The Olde Angel Inn,Canada,Ghost Tours & Haunted Hotels,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Ghost Tours & Haunted Hotels :: A Bizarre Encounter At The Olde Angel Inn

A t the early morning hours of May 25th, 1813, American military forces had launched a third invasion attempt against Canada. After U.S. Naval vessels had arrived along the shores of the Niagara River, a relentless two-day assault commenced against the British defense stronghold of Fort George. Despite valiant efforts to defend the fort, the Redcoat defenders were soon overwhelmed by the invading forces and had no other option than to abandon the fort. The Americans soon stormed into the adjacent town of Newark (modern day Niagara on the Lake) with the intentions of burning it to the ground. The siege ultimately led to a local tavern known as the Harmonious Coach House, where a British officer named Captain Colin Swayze would meet his tragic demise.

In order to flush out any enemy troops hiding within the tavern's basement, American soldiers took their bayonets and began systematically impaling the wooden wine barrels as well as any other objects capable of concealing any potential hiders. After being spotted within the confines of an empty barrel, Captain Colin Swayze was promptly stabbed and succumbed to his injuries almost immediately. (Mysteries of Canada, 2024)

Eventually, the Harmonious Coach House was renamed the Olde Angel Inn. Due to the utter brutality of Captain Swayze's death, it comes as no surprise that his restless spirit continues to linger aimlessly throughout the inn. Nestled within the heart of Niagara on the Lake, the Olde Angel Inn remains a popular destination for those intrigued by the many alleged hauntings reported over the span of several years. Being highly publicized in multiple paranormal reality shows, it becomes rather easy to understand why the inn receives such high amounts of revenue in tourism on an annual basis.

My first and only trip to the Olde Angel Inn happened back in August of 2006. I was accompanied by my mother, as well as my sister and brother. We had been informed of an apparent incident that occurred at the inn years prior to our arrival, which fueled our interests to visit. It was said that the incident involved a young American woman visiting the town with a group of her friends and decided to spend the night at the renowned hotel. She apparently wore a T-shirt depicting the image of a waving American flag. After exiting her room and nonchalantly traversing the hall, she abruptly stopped in her tracks, as she claimed to have felt the intense sensation of being slapped across the face. Though there was no definite proof to explain the encounter, it could be surmised that the vindictive Captain Swayze still continues to express his distain for those who happen to share the same nationality as the lone individual responsible for his departure.

We had finally arrived at the inn in the late afternoon. Though we were all mildly nervous, we were still highly excited and decided to help ease the tension by making jokes about the encounters reported by former guests. After an evening of bike riding, followed by an extended tour of Fort George, we decided to head back to the inn and go to sleep. For the first couple of hours, I struggled to fall asleep. Once I had begun to gradually calm myself down, I began to drift off and abruptly awoke, feeling as if someone had forcibly grabbed my shoulders. I was perfectly aware that I was the only one fully awake, as the others were peacefully sleeping in the adjacent bedroom. Despite the bewildering experience, I soon managed to fall asleep and woke up the following morning feeling well rested. The hotel had even given us a certificate to confirm our stay at the inn. As a humorous gesture, my mother decided to hang the certificate on our refrigerator. In spite of the strange experience, I still hope to one day return to the Olde Angel Inn and perhaps share even more personal stories.

Glowing White Light,"Maine, United States",Orbs / Lights / Mists,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Orbs / Lights / Mists :: Glowing White Light

H ave you ever been scared out of your mind before? I have and this is exactly what happened to me the night I probably will never forget. It was around eight o'clock, it was getting dark. My neighbor tripped me and I fell to the ground. I laid there as he walked away. I kept trying to scare my little sister, my neighbor, and my two little cousins all night long. So I got up from where I was laying and knocked on the window.

They knew it was me so after a while I got bored of knocking, then ran back to lay down in the damp grass. I got up and walked over to go inside, when I saw this bright glowing white light, across from me, run as fast as it could go across my grandparents field. What ever it was, it had a glowing white body with an old styled hat with a bow tied round it. After I saw it, I was in shock, so I kind of just stopped. After realizing I had just seen the supernatural, I ran for the basement door crying. I told my grandfather and he said he had seen a ghost once when he was younger, which he had lived in the house next door (being my great grandmother's) for years.

I was so freaked out, I don't go back out that way during the night, I stay on the other side of the house.

Julie's at Peace,"Nebraska, United States",Psychic / Medium,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Psychic / Medium :: Julie's at Peace

I attended grade school; middle school and high school like most people do with many of the same people present year after year. You get to know the people you attend with, some by faces, some by name and some you have friendships and more long standing relationships. There are some people that affect you more than others, some you remember and some you don't.

Through out all of my school years there was a girl I went to school with named Julie (I have changed even her first name so as not to upset any family of hers or hamper any investigations).

Julie was an average person. She tried very hard to be liked, strong, confident and to excel in school. For some reason though, many of these things never quite melded for Julie. I always thought there was an extreme sadness to her, in her eyes and just in her being. Whenever we talked (and usually this was in a group type setting) she never wanted to talk about personal issues such as her home life, her parents, siblings etc. Whenever the topic of conversation came around to her, she would always answer question very vaguely and change the subject.

In high school Julie developed a severe acne problem. This did not do much for her popularity; kids can be so terribly cruel. Just from the smallest amount of information she would talk about regarding her home life, I understood her family to live on very limited means. Her parents finally were able to take her to a doctor for her acne condition, the medication that she was given made things worse, it made the skin appear dark red.

In my junior year close to the end of the year, I asked her to sign my annual. She did. I told her that we would have one more year together so that would be good. She said then that she wasn't coming back for her senior year. I asked why. She said she never really fit in and it wasn't like she was a scholar or anything so she might as well get a job. She then said that maybe that wouldn't have to be all her life was going to be though because maybe she would meet her prince charming and he and she would have a wonderful life together. I told her I was sad that she wouldn't be coming back, but to keep in touch. I gave her my phone number.

That was the last time I saw Julie until about 10 months ago or so. For some reason I woke up one morning thinking about Julie. It seemed everywhere I went I saw her, I even stopped a few times to talk to her only to find it was not her, it was in fact a stranger or to find she had disappeared into a crowd. I remember thinking and praying that all had worked out for her the way she had hoped. I remember mentioning it to my husband. He said I must have seen someone on television or something that reminded me of her. Okay...

About one week after I began thinking about Julie, I started thinking how sad she is (not was, is) and how I wished I could help. I couldn't quite figure out how. I checked all phone listings, even the net and could not find a listing for her. All the people I know that knew her as well had long since lost contact with her.

About a week and a half after Julie had began to occupy my thoughts and dreams, a couple of days after I felt her sadness, I was reading on the sofa next to my husband while he watched the idiot box. The evening news came on. All of the sudden I heard her name - at the very beginning of the news cast. I am pretty sure most city local news is the same, the most intriguing and important stories highlighted with a blurb first then the news.

I had not heard what they said and my husband said he wasn't paying close enough attention to be accurate. We continued to watch. About 15 minutes into the news cast they flash to this abandoned furniture store/Laundromat that had been deserted and boarded up on a street I recognized very well. The cameras of the news team where there live, there where red and blue lights glowing from police and emergency vehicles spotlighting a ring around the building of yellow crime scene tape. Julie had been found by a perspective property management firm in the basement of this building. She had been wrapped crudely; I guess I could say stuffed from how it was explained into to ancient musty filthy rugs. She was half clothed, beaten, victimized sexually and finally strangled to death with a piece of telephone cord. The cord was tied in a bow around her neck.

I threw my book down and cried and cried. My husband tried to provide comfort. I felt such a tremendous sadness. It was if I was crying not only my tears but her tears also. I must have cried myself to sleep that night, I don't remember falling to sleep, but as I awoke to morning, I realized my husband had helped me to bed.

They buried Julie about 15 days later after a full autopsy. It was a county funeral as most of her family would not come forward. I attended the grave side ceremony. Only two of the people we had attended school with aside from me were there. That fact combined with absent family and loved ones brought on the crying again, crying and sadness that I didn't feel I could control. My husband then thought I should see a doctor, maybe if it was an overly emotional female 'thing'. Right.

Almost one month to the day I began thinking about Julie, as I had later confirmed with my journal, I awoke very early one morning and couldn't go back to sleep at all. I got up, went to my main floor and got a glass of tea and turned on the idiot box. I then heard the wind outside pick up suddenly. This is not uncommon in Nebraska. I got up to make sure the screen door was securely latched (we have lost a few doors that way). I went onto the front porch to check. I looked up and saw Julie standing out side my door. I just stared at her. She was wearing her favorite jeans. Her favorite sweat shirt, her hair in her favorite style, carrying her favorite pink striped purse, there was no acne visible at all and the sadness was gone from her face and her eyes. Julie simply looked at me and said, 'Well, it didn't happen the way I wanted, but I found peace and harmony the hard way. I hurt for a long time, but not any more. I didn't find my prince charming, as you saw on the news; he killed me and turned it into a joke also, like many people thought my life was, a joke. I am okay now and it is peaceful here, no one will ever hurt me again. Let's stop crying and thanks for being there.' As I opened my mouth to speak she was gone. No flashes, no noises, no wind, just gone.

I was so glad she let me know she was finally okay. I will treasure this memory always.

Someone Was Playing Tricks on my Father,Costa Rica,Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: Someone Was Playing Tricks on my Father

O n my previous story I told you about the little girl that lived in my house. Well this one we really did not know what it was. I never really saw it but did feel and saw things it did.

One night, at the same house, my dad had just come home from work and was getting ready to get in the shower. My mom asked me if I wanted to go to the store with her. My dad turned around and said make sure you take your keys so that I don't have to come out of the shower to open the door for you. We left and my dad got in the shower.

Once in there he thought I should check to make sure that I had closed the door so he got a towel and wrapped it around him and got out of the shower. Right when he opened the door, he heard a knock, and he said out loud ""I told you to take keys with you"". He went to open the door to find no one there. He even noticed that I had closed the door. When he turned around, he felt that someone had past by him. Like when someone pass by you and they make like a swoosh of air? Like that! He said that he thought it was an open window and did not think much of it, then got back in the shower. He said that as he was showering, he could hear music and voices. When we got home he told us all about it.

The whole time he was not afraid, he thought my mom and I were playing games with him. Come to find we had no intentions of it at all...

The Old Lady that Never Left her House,"Arkansas, United States",Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: The Old Lady that Never Left her House

W hen I was in Junior High my dad's company had him gone 3 weeks out of the month. As a teenager it was great for me not to have my dad watching over my shoulder all the time, but it got pretty tiring for him! His company was out of Nebraska but they had another location in a little town about 45 minutes from West Memphis called Marianna, AR. My dad and 2 other engineers would spend 3/4 of their time there, so after spending tons of money at the local Holiday Inn, the company decided to buy an old house in town for the guys to stay in.

My father was the one there 90% of the time, and at any given time there might be 4 men in the house. My dad helped find a huge house on one of the main streets in town, an old manor looking house built in the late 1800s. The great thing about it was that after the lady had passed away, she had no surviving relatives and the furniture stayed with the house. So they thought it was great to get a furnished 5 bedrooms (mansion type) at a cheap price. There was even an elevator built in the house. The owner's daughter had polio and rather then carry her up and down the three flights of stairs, they added the elevator. We thought it was really cool to begin with!

Everything went really well for the first couple of months - they were close to work, and it was kind of like a 2nd home to the guys, they got pretty comfortable. About 2 months after they purchased the house, they would get woken up by the sounds of the elevator going up and down. My dad would get up to check on it and everything would look fine, so I think he put it out of his head and figured it was the old wiring or something, and he would go back to bed. This might happen 2 or 3 times a night.

They had a caretaker that would come in a few times a week and clean and watch the house when there was no one staying there. She would complain that her supplies would disappear on her, and sometimes she would feel like someone was in the house with her. One time she complained because she kept a garden in the back yard, and her gardening gloves disappeared on her. She went and bought new ones only to have the original ones on the kitchen table when she returned.

So I remember one night my dad called my mom in a panic. He and a couple of other guys had driven into Memphis and had dinner on Beale Street. They had a couple of beers and ribs and came back home. About 2 in the morning, my dad and Larry, the one who's room was next to my dad's, woke to the sounds of someone running up and down the hall. They sounded like they were going to the bathroom down the hall. At this point they thought there was someone in the house. My dad had kept a hand gun in the night stand, so he grabbed his gun and he and Larry were sure that they would open the bathroom the door, and catch an intruder. Well they opened the bathroom door and found muddy footprints that went into the bathtub and stopped. At this point they were baffled and a little freaked out. They checked the windows, checked the doors. None had been bothered.

After that happened, they always laughed it off to the old ghosts of the house, but sometimes they didn't feel real comfortable when they had to stay in the house by themselves. So one August the company decided to fly all the families into Memphis for kind of a company picnic. They had us staying in Forest City which is half way between Marianna and Memphis, and the second night we stayed in Memphis. All the guys had teenage daughters and apparently they didn't think we would be comfortable staying in the house. But we did spend the first afternoon there.

You know how teenage girls are, they like to snoop! When you would go up the first set of stairs when you came to the landing for the 2nd floor, there was a huge portrait of the owner. I remember it creeped us out - not because it was very old, it was probably done in the 60s or early 70s, but because she was looking straight ahead so no matter where you moved it looked like she was watching you. You would go up the next set of stairs and there was a door and another set up stairs that led up to the attic. One of the other girls and I decided to go take a look, as we opened the door that led to the attic steps, a basket with fake flowers came flying at us, like someone was at the top of the stairs and threw it down. Scared the crap out of us, I remember we couldn't get downstairs fast enough.

At this point there was no way that we were going to try the elevator! I remember our dads kind of chuckling and telling us that it must have just fallen off something in the attic. Yea - right at us! We just decided that the old lady didn't want us snooping in her house. The company had the house maybe another 6 months and I think they finally sold it. My dad and I talk about driving by the house if we are ever back that way, maybe ask the owners if they still have ""wiring"" problems with the elevator.

That Day I Started to Believe in Ghosts,"Virginia, United States",Poltergeists / Physical Manifestations,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Poltergeists / Physical Manifestations :: That Day I Started to Believe in Ghosts

B ack in high school I went over a friend's house after school. While we were in her room she decided to tell me that there was a ghost in her house. I at the time did not really believe in ghost and I honestly thought she was crazy. She began telling me what crazy things would happen at her house. She said that ""the ghost"" or what ever it was would change the TV channels, change her radio stations, and rip her cat pictures on her wall. These pictures were ones she got out of a calendar and hung on her wall.

After she told me these things, we decided to watch some TV. She would put the TV on a certain channel and the channel would change. Every time she put it back to the same station it would change to another one. Yeah it freaked me out a little but hey like I said, I didn't believe in ghost. I just thought to myself that she changed the channel with the remote that goes to the TV. No big deal. Next she wanted to listen to some music and the same thing happened. The station would change from what she wanted to be listening to, to something different. I just knew somehow she was messing with me.

Well she was getting mad that nothing we did was working out. No watching TV and no listening to music... without it changing on us. So she started digging under her bed. As most kids in school, they love to hide things under their bed or just shove a bunch of stuff under there. I heard something rip. Great... Now she was trying to get me to believe the cat pictures in her room ripped! She looked up at me from digging under her bed and said to start looking at my cat pictures. I looked around the room and they all looked fine until I got to the one that was behind my head. It was ripped in half! I almost screamed when I saw that. I knew there was no way anyone could have done that. It was not ripped when I came in and no one was in there but her and me. I looked into the mirror across her room and saw a dark shadow.

I took off down her stairs and told her I was calling my parents to get me. I never did go back over her house again. That day I started to believe in ghosts!

She Needed to Go to the Light,"Washington, United States",Psychic / Medium,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Psychic / Medium :: She Needed to Go to the Light

T his happened 20 years ago. It took me 10 years to tell someone, and even now, I am very careful about who I tell it to. I woke up at about 5:30 a.m. (no, I was NOT dreaming) and when I saw the time, was getting ready to go back to sleep. Instead, there in front of me, were three figures; an adult female, an adult male, and a male child.

They were in repose, the woman closest to me. It was weird, because it was as if I was slightly above them. There was a bright light behind them, and they all appeared in a kind of holographic way; 3D, in other words. I was so shocked and scared I could hardly breathe, but I managed to ask ""Who are you?"" The woman turned her head and looked at me, then turned her head back (they were all looking up) and the 'vision' dropped like an elevator out of sight and the room went black.

Naturally, I was scared to death. I told no one. Then, three weeks later, while I was at my brother's house (yes, I was elsewhere this time) the vision appeared again, and again, early in the morning. This time, however, it was just the woman and she was holding a telephone receiver and appeared very stressed, very upset, and crying. I again asked who she was, and again, she looked at me and then the vision dropped out of sight. This time, I was more curious than scared.

I left the next morning to visit family in Minnesota (this happened in Washington state) and I went, of all places, to a psychic fair. I sought out someone who was doing Tarot readings and had a reading. Then, I told her what happened and said I was worried that I had attracted something evil or bad. She took a deep breath, went into a 'trance' (who knows) and told me that no, this person was caught in the astral plane and if I ever saw her again, I should send her to the light I was seeing behind her.

Another three weeks went by (why this was in three week increments I don't know) and I saw her again. This time, she looked very scared, very defeated. She was still holding the phone, and I asked her to look at me. She did. Right at me. I told her to turn and go into the light behind her because that's where her husband and son were. I don't know why I said that, I have no idea who those other people were the first time I saw them, but it just spilled out. She looked at me one last time, turned, walked into the light and the picture dropped again. I never saw them again.

But, afterward, for many years (and it still happens) I will see disembodied faces floating by, or sometimes, whole street scenes (which could be remote viewing, who knows). I am always awake when this happens, and very occasionally, it happens during the day.

I have no idea what the experience was... I have been trying to find out, but the only answer I ever get is that I helped someone cross over. So is this a ghost story? I don't think so, but didn't know where else to put it.

A Child Ghost,"Ohio, United States",Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: A Child Ghost

I was six years old at the time. Our house was three stories with the second floor being rented out. My brother Mark and I were to sleep on the third floor which had three bedrooms. After saying goodnight to our parents, I ran up the steps alone. Mark was still in the living room talking.

When I reached the top step of the third floor, I saw a very young girl around the age of four or five sitting on my bed. She was dressed in a white frilly dress. Her hair was long and curly with a large white bow on top of her hair. We didn't speak we just looked at each other. After standing and staring I turned and ran down the stairs to get my parents. My older brother was at the bottom of the stairs when I told him a girl was sitting on my bed. He said he would run her off thinking she may be living on our second floor. I never went further than the bottom of that first flight of stairs. She was gone, never coming down the steps. I told my parents about the young girl, they said no children were living on the second floor. Nothing was ever said again.

Fours years later I was playing in a bedroom on the second floor, which no one slept in because it was always cold. My mom was giving my twin sisters a bath when the bed lifted off the ground and started to shake. I started laughing thinking my two brothers were doing this to me. I leaned over the bed after it was lowered to the ground and lifted up the bed covers. No one was under the bed. I didn't tell anyone until five years ago.

The family had gathered for Thanksgiving dinner when I told my story about the bed being raised off the ground. To my surprise Karen, my younger sister had experienced the exact same occurrence in that cold bedroom. She never told anyone until that night. My mom moved out when I turned twenty one. I don't know why I was able to see the little girl but I have never forgotten her.

Ghosts in the House,"West Virginia, United States",Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: Ghosts in the House

M y nephew Jason told me one time that he seen a ghost in their house out at Rig, WV where they lived as he was growing up. Now Jason

is much older now but, this is what he told me about that one day. He said he had seen a ghost of a pilgrim standing in the bathroom.

Now, this house has been standing for many years and I'm most sure it was there back in the civil war days and slavery.

Some of the nights I stayed out there I felt like someone was breathing over me at nights. I would automatic freeze and wouldn't move and I would keep the light on in that bedroom all night. Another ghost story I have for you is it all happened when my older sister's husband brought these dead man's clothes home with him and my sister seen this black figure disappear in the walls of what was once a bedroom, now it is part of the living room and now my younger sister and her husband live there today so, I'll have to ask her if she experience any ghost while living there.

Has anyone experience anything like this before?. What did you do at the time? Do you all think ghost could talk to you or not and if they did would you talk back to them or would you be scared and run away from them?.

Heat Wave Victim,"Illinois, United States",Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: Heat Wave Victim

T his is actually a story that happened to my uncle Jim, not me quite some time ago. I just discovered this site recently and I just wanted to see someone else's opinion on the matter. When I would visit my uncle as a child, something about his apartment made me feel uneasy. It wasn't until I was a little bit older and after he had moved out that he told our family he thought it had been haunted.

During the mid 1990's my uncle Jim rented an old apartment building here on the south side of chicago. If I am dating this right, this story happened in either 1995 or 1996. During this time, the summers here in the midwest had become incredibly hot and dry and chicago suffered extreme heat waves. People were bussed to shelter areas in the city just so they could spend the days in air conditioning and not suffer.

Since uncle Jim's building was very old, it had no central air conditioning unit and tenants had to either buy their own window units or go without. Uncle Jim's landlady happened to be a pretty stubborn elderly woman who refused to go to the shelter areas and or to buy a unit of her own. Sadly, she wound up passing away from the severe heat.

About three nights later, the heat was just as bad as ever and since uncle jim didn't have much money at the time, he was sleeping with all of the windows open due to his lack of an air conditioner. All of a sudden, he woke up because his room had become freezing cold. He stuck his arm out the window and could feel the extreme temperature difference between the outside and the inside. Uncle Jim was convinced that his landlady was trying to prevent anyone else from getting harmed by the extreme heat.

After that, he often reported hearing noises in the attic and something passing him on the apartment stairs. Do you really think it was the land lady trying to protect people?

Satanic Cult Encounter,"Michigan, United States",Misc,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Misc :: Satanic Cult Encounter

I don't know where to start. Let me just say that I am a strong Christian and you should never mess with evil. Just over 2 years ago in early October, me and a few of my friends had been toilet papering people every week. It was sort of our little rendition. We had always heard of a supposedly ""satanic cult"" that was nearby, about 10 minutes from our high school.

At this point in our lives we had all graduated, '05. We thought it would be fun if we could sneak on to the cult's property and fork and TP them. My friends had been drinking a little so I drove my friend's car. We parked down the road in some lumber yard type of deal. We all had masks and were dressed in dark clothing. I was scared myself, because I've always wanted to see something with my own eyes and I though I was really about to.

This place was in the middle of nowhere, and there was a pretty full moon, I just remember it being fairly light outside. We had to climb through a fence and we took our time about it. There were a total of 5 of us. (Jesse L, Jesse D, Alex, Andy and myself). Once we got through the fence, there was a grass pasture, we were all walking slowly, when there was a loud eerie noise that, to me, sounded like an old screen door slamming shut. We froze, and bent down at the knees. As far as we could tell, no one else was around.

So after several minutes we continued. We got to a forest like area with trails and a small building, a very old small church. On it said ""church of christ"" There was a light on it and we tried to open it, but it was locked. We stood around for at least 15 minutes trying to look inside this thing, but it was dark inside. At one point I heard something move across the floor. So with nothing really happening at this cult, we left.

We walked back down the dirt road to the lumber place to get in my friend's car. I had the keys. I couldn't get the door open, the key wouldn't work, my friend even tried and it wouldn't unlock. Now this thing had an old key chain thing to push ""lock"", ""unlock"", but they didn't work and without me pressing anything, all of a sudden the alarm went off and the lights start flashing and then the car was unlocked. We all piled in, because supposedly the guy who owned the lumber yard is a real mean SOB. So I put it into drive and got cruising down the road when all of a sudden the lights just shut off, complete darkness. I did not touch anything. Then we had to find the switch and the lights came back on. I slammed on the brakes of course when the lights shut off. So I don't know if a spirit or demon was messing with us, saying don't mess with me. Who knows.

We didn't end of TPing them. The scariest thing that happened was when I got home the next day. I live about 25 miles from where the cult was. I pull up in to my drive way and I saw multiple cats, it was about 3-4 pm so the sun was glaring, I couldn't really tell how many there were. I had one cat, but not anymore than that. So I get out of my car, I love cats by the way. But not these. They were 3 identical all black cats, not yet full grown. No idea where they came from, my dad didn't have any idea where they came from and they happen to just appear out of nowhere, the day after I go messing around at a satanist cult.

So I told a few people, and my sister works with a guy who was supposedly a ghost hunter on the side, she told him about it and he said that it was a warning sign not to be taken lightly. Bad things come in threes. I got rid of those cats, I put them in a box and drove them outside of a town about 7 miles from where I live. The weird thing was when I took them out in the country to a small road my friend said would be a good spot, an all black car followed me down 2 different roads, I put on my blinker to go on the small road, it's actually called clinton TRAIL, so it's small. It put on its blinker to follow. So I said screw this and I went straight. I got out, threw the cats out of the box and haven't went back to the cult since.

I Am Der Teufel,Australia,Ouija Board / Seances,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Ouija Board / Seances :: I Am Der Teufel

R ecently I have taken an interest in seances and have been doing some research into how best to conduct one. The first thing I thought of was, of course, an ouija board. Not knowing how to use one, or even where to get one, I browsed various web sites including Castle of Spirits as well as this one for stories involving ouija boards and instructions on how to use one. I also watched some youtube videos of (supposed) seances.

So far I have gathered that there are many different methods of using an ouija board, such as:

- Minimum of three people (multiples of three apparently work better)

As such, I still wasn't 100% confident I knew what I was doing, but I moved onto the next step of actually getting an ouija board. I'm told they can be bought at toy shops (THEY'RE NOT TOYS!) but I'm also told home made ones work just as well.

So with my home made ouija board in one hand and pointer glass in the other, I began looking for someone I knew who might be more experienced with seances. To my surprise, I discovered that my dad knew quite a bit and had performed some fifty odd seances in his teen years. To my disappointment however, he flat out refused to perform one with me. When I asked him why, he recounted one seance that terrified him to the point that he has never gone near an ouija board since.

He performed a seance with some friends in Melbourne, Australia and made contact with a particularly violent spirit. This spirit was extremely uncooperative and moved the pointer so forcefully that it repeatedly fell off the table. When asked its name, the spirit spelt out 'DER TEUFEL'. At the time, the group thought it was gibberish but wrote it down anyway.

PLEASE NOTE: My Dad does not recall what the exact word was (it happened 30 years ago), only its meaning.

Some days later, one of the people involved looked into what 'DER TEUFEL' meant. He found that it was German for 'the Devil'.

Now before anyone goes off at me for telling such an extreme story, understand that I too think it extremely unlikely that this spirit was actually the devil. My understanding is that spirits, like humans, are under no obligation to tell the truth. I also don't recall the Devil ever referring to himself as 'the Devil' in the bible (I could be wrong). Either way, it is a pretty incredible story.

My Encounter with a Lady Ghost,India,Apparitions / Voices / Touches,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Apparitions / Voices / Touches :: My Encounter with a Lady Ghost

I don't know why it's so but it seems that I'm the only one in my family who goes through these experiences. It happened to me a few months back, when I was in Shimla (a hill station in Himachal Pradesh) with my family during my summer holidays. We stayed there in a house which my father had booked for 10 days. It was a strange and somewhat a frightening place. It was old yet larger.

When I stepped inside that freaky house, I felt someone's presence. At that time, I was a bit scared. I tried to express my fear which I felt to my parents. But they were not really convinced. One night when I was still awake, I heard a voice of a lady who, I think, was trying to lull her child to sleep. The voice was so clear and melodious that I still remembered some of the wordings. But who was she? I went to look for the matter as I could not wake my parents up. I was shocked when I saw a smoke like thing coming out from one of the rooms. I moved forward to clarify the matter. Then again I heard her voice. But this time, the voice was more irritating and painful. Just then the smoke like thing took the form of a lady who was wearing a white saree. It happened so fast that it was just a blur. Everything disappeared and there was silence all around.

After this incident, I pretended to be unwell as this was the only way which could compel my parents to go back home. And it worked.

When I was back, I told everything to my mother but, like always, she didn't believed.

Pinned to my Bed,Australia,Old Hags / Night Attacks / Sleep Paralysis,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Old Hags / Night Attacks / Sleep Paralysis :: Pinned to my Bed

I am in desperate need for even the slightest bit of an explanation to an odd experience I had the other morning. I have always been very open to the ideas that ghosts and spirits are very real, and admittedly I have recently started getting more into tarot and such, however nothing as blatant as this has ever happened to me before and I have been having trouble sleeping ever since.

The other morning, at approximately 5:30 - 6:00 am, I woke up in my friend's bed laying flat on my back, to a heavy pressure on both of my shoulders, almost as if something were pinning me down flat to my bed. I could not scream, and I could not move, and later that morning my friend told me she was startled by my restless nature and the way I was making a strange mumbling noise and moving from side to side. I was so scared, it continued for what felt like a few minutes, and the scariest part of all was that I could see nothing on top of me, but could hear the loudest, most terrifying breathing noises being made in my right ear. It has scared me stiff and I have been staying up almost all night just so I am not caught in the same situation again.

I would really appreciate it if anyone could supply me with some sort of explanation, even if you are unable to help with this particular case, perhaps even a link or an idea on what or who I could contact to find out more? Also, does anyone know what it could be? Is it definitely a spirit or ghost? I am secretly hoping, (while almost positively sure it is one) that it can be explained in some other way, because I'm to terrified to go to sleep again.

A Four Year Olds Tale,"Indiana, United States",Children Who See Spirits,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Children Who See Spirits :: A Four Year Olds Tale

W e have been told that our son has an old soul. Our four year old never woke us up screaming in the middle of the night while teething. When sick he played as hard as when he was well. At two years old he was toddling around the house to help us, didn't get into or tear up everything. He never hit the ""terrible two's"" never got into the ""horrific three's"" and now that he is four he still has the same laid back, taking everything in stride personality that he has always had. My husband and I feel very blessed to have such a well mannered, calm little guy as he is the exact opposite of our daughter when she was his age.

Just before he turned three and was beginning to have conversations with us, some things that we had observed him doing started making sense. It unnerved us, but in the scheme of things, he was little by little allowing us into his life and letting us know what he sees. Of course, some of it we had to figure out what he was really saying and we may have jumped to some conclusions at first, but once words and their meanings became clearer to him, he gave us great detailed descriptions of what was ""bouncing around"".

Anyone with children knows that when their child starts the journey into the spoken word, most of it sounds like jumbled words and phrases that do not seem to quite fit the rest of the sentence. With him he had a long issuance of sounds that we did not recognize, the family (immediate and extended) began working heavily with him on the pronunciation of words. Half the time he spoke English (That is technically the only language he had long exposure to. The neighbors spoke Spanish, but rarely to him) and the other half were a combination of clicking and almost humming sounds, so therefore we began looking into speech therapy for him.

We have always enjoyed his imagination. Even now he prefers to be alone with his ""friends"" but doesn't mind the intrusion when we come in. He regals us with stories of his friends Belle and Justin. We did not want that destroyed. With us being in our late thirties and early forties we know how easy it is to lose the ability to let our minds tell us a story. Plus our daughter had gone through therapy with a psychologist and the results were explosive (That is in a different post). So we were apprehensive about the therapy sessions. Even knowing it was a different therapy, different children, the offices were in the same building, but where we could afford to take him at the time.

He went to two sessions. In the first session the entire hour was video and audio taped. I did not like that. Several years from now someone may be going through old records and find these tapes and there will be my innocent angel up on the screen. I couldn't imagine anything untoward happening, but the unease was there. The second session we watched and listened to bits and pieces of the first while the therapist shook her head and told us that on initial observation, it would appear that he was talking to someone and waiting for answers. In her opinion, he was just having fun with a friend and he had ""made up"" a language that they could have secret conversations with. She recommended a psychologist.

After two consultations, we decided that no further action would be taken. We would just patiently try to teach him to slow down and enunciate words. That would be the solution. There was nothing in his life pointing to a psychological problem, he was just having problems with words.

Then he said the darnedest thing. We have an open relationship with our children. They are encouraged to come to either one of us with anything and we TRY to, with an open mind, help, support and love them through anything that they are going through. My terminally ill father-in-law lives with us (Higher Power love him for hanging on this long) so religion is a big part of our lives, but we do not discuss the ""ins and outs"" of life before and after our physical being with our four year old. ANY conversation to that effect is usually with my daughter and in a room with a closed door out of respect to my father-in-law who is on that brink.

One day we were checking out Daddy's race car (He races a mini-stock locally, nothing big and fancy, just an old mustang) and our son was playing in the drivers seat. Out of the blue he says something to the effect of:

Smiling, Daddy asked him how he was able to choose him when he was a miracle baby that surprised both Mama and Daddy.

He told us that while he was up in Heaven checking out all the Mama's and Daddy's and trying to pick out the perfect ones, he noticed Sissy first. She needed help. Then he noticed Daddy. Our son would sit on a cloud with his feet hanging down and swinging and just watching him. He liked what he saw and began checking me out. He knows that something was keeping Mama from having another baby, but he wanted us, so he came. He said his Daddy needed someone else to love as he had such a good heart and he knew there was enough to go around. Daddy would need help with his hobbies and needed a boy to hang out with.

Some facts: Between the birth of our daughter, now fifteen, and our son, now four, we had three miscarriages. We were told that I am just not a natural born baby carrier, and we should just ""be happy"" with the child that we had (My husband has three other children by a previous marriage that he was prevented in seeing by the ex-wife. Big ugly mess that whole thing is) and accept that there would be no others. At three months pregnant I began having difficulties, almost lost him, and was put on complete bed rest. While in a depressed state I was introduced to my Spirit Guide (a White Buffalo) who literally carried me through. I am Italian and, no blonds or red heads in as many generations that my parents have knowledge of. My husband is half Cherokee Indian, quarter Blackfoot. His father is Cherokee, his mother Cherokee/Blackfoot. No blonde's there. Our son is blond and blue eyed. His name has the number three in it.

I'm not sure that numerology has any kind of play into this. I'm not sure I believe that things can be determined by numerology. Then again, I'm not sure how numerology works. But all the threes... My Guide and my son have the same color hair. Would anyone happen to have some kind of explanation on how he came up with the Heaven story or why he seems to act older than four? And what with the made up language that he still slips into on occasion, any one know what that may be?

The Shadow Figure in the Haunted House,Canada,Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: The Shadow Figure in the Haunted House

M y friends and I went trick-or-treating and we went to this certain house that was supposed to be haunted and which some people died in. I went to the door and found it open, which is was weird, this the door was always boarded up and chained! I went in and heard some kids laughing and running around on the top floor. I went up stairs to investigate and tell the kids to get out. So I told my friends I would be right back, I went up stairs and seen this weird green light under the door. I went in the room and there was no one in there, and when I opened the door there was nothing to be seen.

Which was weird because I heard laughing, running and a green light, and plus the front door was open. Then all of a sudden the door closed and locked itself. I went to open the door and couldn't get it opened. Then I went and looked out the window and felt like someone was right behind me and I quickly turned around and there was a dark tall shadow by the corner. I was so shocked at the sight. I usually am not scared at a sight of spirits but this one just gave off a sad presence. It moved through the wall and then the door slowly opened and I walked out and the figure was on the stairs slowly gliding down them. It was as if he wanted me to follow it. I did. I went down into the kitchen area and stood by the back door. I went out the door and then it felt as if there was another spirit there. It was freaky. Then the tall shadow figure disappeared. It just vanished. It felt like he wanted me to go out the door and go into the back yard as if he wanted me to get something or find something for it. I then went to my friends and told them. When I looked back I seen it in the window. I never went back.

Ghost in my Room,"Indiana, United States",Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: Ghost in my Room

O nce, long ago... I met a ghost. The ghost was a male about 15 years old. I lived in a haunted home it seemed. I was 16 when I met this ghost. He told me he had shot himself. I talked to him for a few minutes. Other members of my family witnessed him as well.

I would go to the upstairs with friends at times and tell the ghost to turn on the water... And sure enough he would turn the water on. And then I threw a ball into the closet and ask the ghost to toss it to me and then the ball was thrown into the air. One of my uncles was reading a newspaper at the time and saw the ghost. He himself looked like a ghost with an ashy look on his face! He nearly had a heart attack! The ghost had torn the newspaper in half. My uncle dared not go up to the apartment again. See, we had an apartment and it was nice and all, but it was haunted as well. My grandmother had seen the ghost as well, she was in the basement doing laundry and she was scared as all get out! She said, that she would have me do the laundry from now on.

Yes... This is a true story. I have also lived in another haunted house many years ago... It was spooky and I always felt there was a strange presence there. I love haunted homes.

Warnings from Spirits,"Illinois, United States",Family / Friends Visits,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Family / Friends Visits :: Warnings from Spirits

F irst of all I would like to explain my Uncle. He drank a lot and could get a little overbearing at times. But as I remember him, he was an outrageously funny person, he was kindhearted and he treated me and my siblings very well. He was only welcomed at my mother's home. His other siblings would not let him stay at their place of residence.

Well, when my Uncle passed, we had the repass at my Aunt's home. Everyone was sitting around eating and drinking and talking about him. As the talking progressed, pictures started literally being thrown of the walls. Everyone just looked and said nothing. We were in awe. My Aunt's picture had been on her walls every since I could remember. Now they were on the floor. We heard my twin cousin screaming, ""let me out"". He had gone down to the basement to retrieve something for my Aunt. The door's lock was on the outside of the door. We pushed the latch back in the opposite direction and let him out. We asked what happened and he told us that when he came upstairs to the door, he heard the lock go into place and when he tried pushing open the door he could not get out. I could only guess who could have locked the door and that my Uncle was probably upset about his siblings talking too much about him. The talking ceased about him.

I had a dream about a cat. I have a morbid fear of cats and dogs. In this particular dream, I would be walking in an empty building and a cat would jump onto my back. I could not get this cat off my back. I would scream and holler, saying get off me and that cat would not bulge. It stayed glued to my back. And the most frightening was the cat would rub it face against my face and out of shear panic I would wake up. I dreamt this dream three days in a row. It was so disturbing about the reoccurrence of the same dream, that I called my mother, Aunt and my grandmother. They told me the same thing. I was letting someone into my home that hated my guts and that I was being warned. I was told to clean house by being careful with whom I socialized with. I started showing better judgment with people after what I was told. I never dreamt that dream again.

My best girlfriend in the world (we had known each other since the first grade. She was like the sister I never had.) had a dream about her dad coming to visit her. Her dad had passed over and before he left this realm, he was diabetic, blind and could not walk. He was wheelchair bound. She called me up and told me about this dream. He would walk across the street come through her door and say, ""I came to see about you Cookie"". She also dreamt this dream three times. I told her I did not know what that meant, or may be he was coming to take her to the other side. She told me if it's her time to go then so be it. Three months later she had passed over too from an unexpected illness. I miss her dearly. Sometimes, I think about her and about what her father had said to her.

There are so many that I do not understand. I hope in the course of my life on this earth, I will. Thank you for reading another one of my stories.

Some Ghost Keep Taking my Jewelry,"New York, United States",Poltergeists / Physical Manifestations,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Poltergeists / Physical Manifestations :: Some Ghost Keep Taking my Jewelry

I basically think I have either a ghost or a poltergeist residing in my home. Certain little things have tipped me off to thinking that, like my jewelry disappearing from time to time. The strange thing is, it's only certain things that are taken. Like necklaces for instance, and heart shaped ones at that.

I don't understand that, but I know no one's in my house when I or my family is not there. It really is very annoying. I mean I have a ouija board, and maybe when I get a friend over or something I'll contact whatever's doing this...

I just really wonder why it's only jewelry of mine that's heart shaped...hmm. Even as I'm writing this, I hear what sounds like foot steps coming from upstairs. I'm home alone and it's kind of of spooky. I've never really seen a ghost, but I have heard a ghosts voice, and communicated with them through ouija. But I've never really dealt with a poltergeist before.

I'd really appreciate a little bit of help with this. I know none of my family members took my two heart-shaped necklaces. The last one, I lost was just this week. They literally seemed to have disappeared.

I've also noticed that sometimes my animals act funny when I'm home alone as if they sense something.

Do you think animals can sense and are aware of these types of things?

"Hauntings in Elk Grove, Ca","California, United States",Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: Hauntings in Elk Grove, Ca

M y dad divorced my mother after cheating on her when I was thirteen, and moved in with ""the woman"" and they were together for 6 years. Last year they bought a huge house in Elk Grove Ca and half an acre of land. Behind the stone wall of the back yard was miles of unbuilt on land, soon to be new homes. The house only had one owner before us. They sold it due to divorce, not even living in the house a year.

Ever since they moved there, (I lived with my mom and visited on weekends, I'm 20 now) I always felt uneasy there as if I was being watched but I NEVER thought anything of it. Not in a 2 years old house. I would be sitting on the couch watching TV and the family room would be right past the TV. I would be sitting there and I would see the light in family room dim as if something moved through it. Not that that was the case. I am very skeptical and I know it could just be the power outlet and lack energy at that moment. I just feel that after certain events it plays a roll. That was the beginning.

Another evening I was sitting on the couch again with the whole family and could have sworn I saw someone walk by in the family room. I thought my eyes were playing tricks on me. Until my ""step mom"" said ""Did you see that?"" My dad replied "" What? The shadow that just walked by? Yeah, I saw it but I didn't want to say anything because I thought it was just me"" I felt my face get white because it was noticeable enough that they both saw it.

About a month went by and I was over visiting once again. My dad and his girlfriend decided to go to home depot. It was about 7pm and dark out. I was upstairs in the computer room on the computer. The computer sits on a desk that when you sit at it, your back faces a wall and there is only about 2 feet behind you until you hit the wall. I was checking my e-mail and I felt a distinct tap on my shoulder. I was FROZEN in fear. I didn't even bother to turn around, I acted as if I didn't feel it. I knew there was no HUMAN behind me NO one was home. I stopped visiting as much.

But I heard a lot of went on and witnessed some as well as time passed. They have a border collie and HATED to go outside, you couldn't get her out in the back unless she HAD to ""go"". Well after the night at the computer, she wouldn't come inside the house anytime you opened the door she bolted out. You would have to drag her inside. When inside, she would pee all over herself. Mind you she is a 9 year old dog and hasn't went inside since she was potty trained when she was a pup. My dad's girlfriend works for the FAA as well as my dad and she was away for a month doing schooling in Oklahoma. My dad has been in the military for about 20 years and I have never heard of anything to scare him, of course losing his family, but anything other than that. But when I went to sleep in the guest room, at the top of the room in the corner was what I can describe it as a Black blob, just kind of rotating in place. I showed my dad and he saw it too. It was never there in the day but every night there it was.

This went on for about 2 months with still seeing shadows or anything that I guess you really couldn't say for sure was something paranormal. Until one evening I woke up thirsty. I turned the stair lights on and went down stairs to get some water. I had the dog with me following my every move, and she did, she was right on my heals as she hated being in the house anyway. As I walked to the stairs in the dark with just a gleam of the light coming from up stairs, it was then I heard it. A distinct whispering in my ear which made every hair on the back of my neck stand up. The dog behind me bolted through the kitchen toward the sliding glass door barking AT ME in fear, as if I was the thing she was scared of. That only intensified my fear even more. I ran up the stairs tripping on the last step to the top and ran in my room. I ended up falling asleep with my hands over my ears just in case I heard it again. I NEVER told my dad or ANYONE. If I talked about it, it would only make me more nervous about it.

Sometimes I just feel like if you talk about things like this, it makes it worse, or makes yourself more ""open"" to these experiences. Well I didn't at first. It was when my dad's girlfriend was at school, my dad was home alone getting ready for bed. They have this huge bath room with no door, just a walk way separating it from the bedroom. He was facing the mirror which you could see in the reflection, the bedroom. His girlfriend again was in oklahoma, I was with my mom 45 minutes away. He had locked up for the night and the dog was in her kennel.

He was brushing his teeth when he saw a black shadow of a person walk quickly by his view of the room. The room was well lighted. My dad turned around and walked into the room and no one was there. He started to hear slight bangs on the walls around the house, up stairs, down stairs, ALL over. My dad not being one who gets scared, walked down stairs in the dark to conquer his fear to show himself or whatever else he wasn't afraid. He stood down stairs in the family room, the WHOLE house in darkness. He started to CURSE out loud saying to whatever it was, to show him what it's got. He then said ""f*** you! Show me what you have got"". Then in his ear was a low deep growl in his ear. My dad said he was so paralyzed with fear for something just growled right in his ear, after saying all of that in the pitch dark. He then pursued to walk to the kitchen (in the dark) to get some water and walked back up stairs as if nothing happened, to not show whatever it was the fear he felt.

I then got a call from him and his voice was shakey and he told me what happened. When he told me, I had chills run up my spine. I told him then of what happened to me.

The next day my dad tried to get a priest to come and bless the house. But he wouldn't be able to get that done for about another two days. So my dad took the bible and read various verses in the bible about 20 minute in each room. 5 minutes into reading in the first room (the family room), we heard a loud metallic bang upstairs as if an old air conditioner was kicking on. Later we went to investigate up stairs but nothing was noticed fallen over or out of place. Not to mention that's not how our air-conditioner sounded when it came on. This was a brand new 900,000 dollar home. It just didn't sound like that. After that our dog came in as if she had never been afraid too. We never had anything happen again after that. The black blob was gone.

Also when all of this scare stuff was going on, we had a christmas. We had decorated the stair case and we took pictures of the beautiful decorations since it was the first christmas in that house. After these incidences were over, we uploaded the pics to find an orb moving up the stair case in each pic. It was as if the orb moved from each pic as it moved up the stairs. We focused in on the orb and zoomed it and you can see a distinct face it.

Well that was just one of my experiences. Let me know what you think.

My Friend's Uncle,"California, United States",Family / Friends Visits,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Family / Friends Visits :: My Friend's Uncle

T his is a pretty short story of an experience that happened to my friend that I witnessed. My friend Kathy is Half Muslim and half irish. Her father Mammoud is full Muslim and her mother chrissy full irish. Her uncle on her father's side was by far her favorite uncle. This happened about a year and half ago.

Her uncle was not doing very well and had some kind of cancer. He was completely bed ridden in the hospital and my friend kathy would visit him all the time. When the doctors told their family that he was not going to be living the very long, they were always visiting him everyday. My friend had a camera and video phone and decided to record her and her uncle having a conversation, so she could always hear his voice. She turned her video phone on and she told her uncle to say something. He looked at kathy and said ""I love You Kathy "".

A couple of days later, she showed me it cause she thought it was sweet and I hadn't met him yet. A week later he past away. My family were invited to the funeral and so many people showed up. When they buried him, he was laid on his side. I don't really know why or if this has any importance to them being muslim and that being tradition.

The next day my friend was crying hysterically and asked if she could come over and I said ""of course"" She was over at my house about 10 minute later. She began to tell me she had a dream the night before, the night after the funeral. She said she was in the cemetery where he was buried in Citris Heights Ca. She said it was very foggy and there was he casket waiting to be lowered and her uncle was sitting up in his casket talking to her. She said he told her how much he loved her and that he will be ok and always watch over her and be there for her. She said she then woke up and went to open her phone to see what time it was. She then noticed that the video she had taken of her uncle was set as her main background and when she opened it, it played the video where he told her he loved her. She said she had never set that as her background and she had many photos and videos taken with her phone since she had taken that video. So it was odd that out of every photo and video she had, that that was the one the got ""accidentally"" set as her background.

What scared her more was because he had just died and it was her uncle looking at her every time she opened the phone, it creeped her out. She tried to change it and take it off. It would not work. You would got to the change default background option and select a different pic and it wouldn't change. I had the same phone as her and I tried to change it and nothing worked. I thought that this was very strange and thought that it was touching.

It's nice to know that they deceased still live on, and watch over us.

Ghost or Earthquake?,"California, United States",Poltergeists / Physical Manifestations,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Poltergeists / Physical Manifestations :: Ghost or Earthquake?

I joined the military when I was sixteen. My father didn't like it, so he marched me straight down to the recruiter's office and had them tear up the contract. Then I decided a few months before my eighteenth birthday that I was going for it again, but keeping it secret. I did not have a horrible childhood. I knew that my parents loved me even though there was conflict. I knew that they didn't agree with what I wanted out of life, so the nearest thing to a fresh start was in the service. My parents were disappointed, my siblings were upset with me, the church was against it and none of my friends understood.

I set out to change the world. I made it through Boot camp, the second time around. I had an attitude and had a problem keeping my mouth shut. A.T. school was easier, but my first assignment was the best! I got stationed on Coronado Island, California. Surrounded by the ocean, SEALS buds marching day and night while chanting, mess hall across the street and the club just two blocks down. What else could I ask for?

I went through about six roomies in the barracks in a four month period. I was one of the lucky ones who only had either two or three others in my room. As I worked in the barracks, I kept changing the numbers in the system so that it looked as if my room was only set up for two. I conveniently skipped that room on inspection walks so it became the ""contraband"" room. Anything that was illegal during an inspection was placed in the ceiling to floor lockers that were empty. I had a ""black list"" and emptied these items into the locker, only to disperse them after an inspection.

The night before the Commanding Officers inspection was a busy night. People from all four floors were standing in line for some locker space. My roomie was taking notes and we were in full swing getting ready for a complete inspection. After everyone left, we locked up the two lockers asking each other what we would keep for the collateral on all the goods. We both fell into the deep and peaceful sleep of the truly exhausted.

About two in the morning, I awoke to my bed shaking. As the lights were out and I could see the hall light through the crack on the bottom of the door, I told my roomie sleepily to stop shaking my bed. I then heard the mirror on the back of the door begin to shake, next the first locker began to rattle as if someone was trying to open it, though it was padlocked. Then the second locker, then mine, next my roomie's. When it got to my roomies bed it actually sounded as if someone was picking up the foot and letting it fall down. My roomie shot up in bed and instantly yelled at me to stop messing with the bed. I was a pretty big prankster, so I can see why. With our eyes and ears, we followed the sound all around our room until it ended back at my bed.

Then it stopped. We looked at each other without a word, then jumped out of bed and ran for the hallway. We opened the door and stood in the door jam, yelling to the rooms down the hall ""Did you feel that earthquake?"" and all the other panicked, things an earthquake rookie yells. To our surprise, we woke our whole floor up. No one else had been woken by the shaking. We eventually went back to bed.

When daylight hit, we checked out the room for damage, and seeing none, went to get some chow. We asked a few people if they felt the quake and were asking what it would read on the Richter scale as our entire room was rippled by it, and were told there was no earthquake during the night. These guys had stood night watch, so they would have known.

The only real damage was to a gallon of unpasteurized apple cider that was never going to make it to its perfect potency. Items had been shifted and some fell, but nothing was harmed, save for our sleep and peace of mind that is.

What causes these things to happen? Was our room targeted my a ghost who was not thrilled with our contraband room? I will probably never know as I never investigated the place. I do know that my base was a former Nazi prison camp, and sky views will show that the enlisted men's barracks are still in the shape of the swastika . At least they were in 1990 when I was there. I'm not sure if you can look up photo's of the base, and I do not know if they are readily available, but it is the Naval Amphibious Base, Coronado, California .

My Medium Experiences,"Texas, United States",Psychic / Medium,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Psychic / Medium :: My Medium Experiences

M y story starts from when I was little. Throughout my life I've been able to see the nonliving. I've never taken this much into consideration because it's always been there. The earliest incident is my older brother's 3rd birthday. One day, my mom was going through some pictures of family members. On one pictures she showed me her mother, a lady I never had the pleasure of meeting. When she showed me the picture, I told her that I remembered her from one of the birthday party of my brother. I described in detail the cake because I remembered that I really liked it. My mom thought I was crazy because she claims that at the time I was only a month old. But I know what I remember. So I was not believed about remembering the birthday party, much less about seeing my grandmother there. Sometimes I think that maybe I am crazy and make this up my self.

Another time, at the age of 13, me and my mother were going to a meeting she had downtown in Houston Tx. When we were nearing the place, we stopped at the light to cross and then I saw this little boy of the age of 2 or 3. He was crying. I got close to see what was the matter and asked where was his mom. He looked at me, ran away into the street. I saw a car come towards it and jumped back and screamed. My mother scolded me because I had made such a spectacle of my self. I was crying saying that the little kid got run over, but there was nothing there. We walked down to the next street where there was a big commotion going on. Apparently there had been a family that got run over by a truck, that when turning the corner it was dragging a trailer full of wood and somehow it let go and rammed the family. This had just happened because the ambulance had just pulled up. There was a little boy on the road dead and the mother had suffered damage to her legs... All I remember is her crying out to her husband asking where was her baby. I did not realize until later that day, when I watched the news, that the little dead boy was the one I had seen on the street. I recognized his picture on the news. That is when I really started believing that I could see things that were not normal.

It had happened to me in other occasions but nothing hit me so hard as this. For nights I could not sleep, not because of what I had seen, but more because I felt a huge sense of guilt. I felt like that there was something else I could have done and did not do.

A month after that in my trailers where we lived, I had another encounter. This time it was one of my neighbors. Mister Pete, we called him. I was outside playing and he came walking to his home and exchanged hellos. I really liked him because he was really nice. But that was the last time we ever saw him. I did not think anything crazy about seeing him because I remember that at that same time, every day in the evening he always went out to get his mail. That was on friday. I remember that much because since the next day I did not have to go to school, I stayed out later that normal playing.

A week later his children came and started clearing out the house. I asked why was he moving? They told me that they were selling the trailer because he had died las friday morning in the hospital from a stroke.

For a while after that I closed my self to that realm. I started really trying to contact but nothing ever happened. So I gave up. I thought my encounters had come to an end until one night when I was 20. I had just moved out of my house and into a new apartment with my best friend. I loved that place. I had a habit of always going to wash clothes late in the night. I liked going when ever there was no one there.

One day I went late as always and found a girl doing her laundry. I did not talk to her but just asked if she was almost done. She looked at me but did not answer me. I thought that was kind of rude but I'm not going to start a mess either. So I waited for her to finish putting her clothes in the drier. She walked out and left. I went and put my clothes in the washer. As I was walking away, I noticed one of the doors on the driers was wide open. One that she had just used. So I was going to be nice and close it for her and start it when I realized that there was no clothes in there. I was a bit baffled. Then it hit me that none of the driers were actually on. I looked in every single one and realized that they were all empty. But I know I saw her load at least 4 of them. I mean I waited for like 20 minutes for her to finish. I thought I was going crazy. I just left my clothes washing and went to my apartment. I went to sleep.

In the morning when I was going to go and dry my clothes, to my surprise my clothes where dried and neatly folded. As for that part maybe some really nice person need to wash so they did it for me... But I still don't know who it was. So I asked the landlord about the girl. She told me that before she started working there, once on the apartment next to mine, there lived a girl on her own. They claimed that they were going to evict her because one month she never showed up to pay rent. They said that after two weeks of unanswered eviction notices, they force entered into the apartment. They said that all the security lock were locked from the inside and that all her things were still there. But there was no sign of her. They did say that the water faucet on the sink was on and that there was a broken glass on the door. Apparently they called the police but nothing out of the ordinary was ever found.

My last experience I can remember is one night in my same apartment. I was like 22 and it was my roommates birthday. She had had a lot of people over to celebrate. I had gone to sleep early because I had a headache. I woke up around 4 in the morning because I had to go to the restroom. So for me to get to the restroom, I needed to cross her room first. Her door was open. I went to use the restroom. On my way back to my room, I kind of glanced in her room and saw an older lady sitting on her bed with her. It did not startle me or anything, but I think that it was because I was 99% still asleep...

So the next morning we got to talking about her party and what a great time she had. Then I just asked ""So who was that lady that spend the night with you, did she have too many shots that you did not let her drive home?"" She looked kind of silly at me and asked what I was talking about. I did not think much about the lady being older because my friend was a server and in her restaurant, there is always people off all ages that still work there. So I described the lady and she fell in shock. She told that when she went to sleep, she dreamt of her grandmother. She showed me a picture and sure enough that was the lady sitting on here bed.

So I don't know what this all means. Might not mean a thing at all. I have been reading some stories here and I guess I'm just happy that none of my experiences have been evil to where they try to hurt me.

A Bad Dream or Possessed?,"Florida, United States",Misc,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Misc :: A Bad Dream or Possessed?

I think I was possessed in a dream... if that's even possible? I was probably around eight or nine years old when this happened and I remember nothing but having a headache and these annoying spinning red and blue blocks in my head that would not go away. My mom told me the next day that I had been sleep walking. She said that I was walking everywhere around the house looking for something and I kept saying ""it hurts, it hurts!"". Then after awhile of searching through the house I found scissors and I tried to cut my stomach open, but my mom grabbed them away before I could hurt myself.

Her and my older brother held me down the rest of the night and she says I was shaking really bad. I have no idea what happen to me and it has never happened again. Sometimes I feel like someone possessed me to feel their pain or help them in some way, but I was too young to realize anything.

Now that I am older I would love to find out what happened. Was is something supernatural or just a dream gone wrong? I don't know much about ghost, spirits or being possessed, so please if anyone could help me or has any ideas that would be great. My sisters have had encounters with ghosts in the same house that I had my encounter of a bad dream or something supernatural. Maybe that might have something do to with it. Maybe not. Do you think it was a nightmare?

Visit from Gran,United Kingdom,Family / Friends Visits,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Family / Friends Visits :: Visit from Gran

I 'd like to tell you about something that happened to me the night my grandmother passed away, I was very close to my gran and cared for her in her old age. I laid in bed the night she passed, upset understandably and all of a sudden I saw two balls of light, one was white and small, the other was large and pink floating towards me, they just drifted next to me, I cleared my eyes a couple of times to make sure I wasn't seeing things, but they were there, clear as day, and for some reason I just felt a calmness in the room.

From that day on, I will always swear that my gran had come to say goodbye... Since then the radios in the house seem to turn themselves on, even if they are not plugged in and I have had so many light bulbs pop, it's hard to keep count. I have also always wondered if I'd told someone and they don't believe you in life, will they get to know the truth in death?

I am also hearing muffled laughing noises, and I am constantly dreaming about my gran, even the other night I could have sworn someone had shook my bed, my gran was a big joker... I guess she is still trying to get one over on me, well she died just over a year now but I can still feel her no matter where I go.

Hands Around my Throat,South Africa,Old Hags / Night Attacks / Sleep Paralysis,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Old Hags / Night Attacks / Sleep Paralysis :: Hands Around my Throat

F our years ago, I started my university education and for the first time I was living away from my family. The university is about 650 kilometers from my hometown and I was living at one of the oldest residences on the campus. It was called Sunnyside and was a female only residence.

I made many friends at Res and we stayed up until odd hours of the morning laughing and having fun. Because of this during the day I would often come back to my room and have a nap in-between lectures. On one such afternoon I went back to my room, set my alarm to wake me up before my next lecture and promptly fell asleep.

At some point I felt like I was floating above my body, I could see myself lying in my bed. Suddenly I was back in my body and I heard someone open the door. I could hear my little cousin calling my name. My first thought was that it couldn't be my cousin because she was in my hometown and she was like 5 years olds she wouldn't be at my university by herself. Then I felt hands around my throat trying to choke the life out of me, my eyes were squeezed tightly shut as I kept thinking this is not my little cousin. I could scream or move my hands to stop whatever was choking me.

I opened my eyes but I was turned on my side and all I could see was the wall. I needed to turn my head so that I could see my attacker. I thought to myself ""I am not afraid and I am going to look this thing in the eye"" but as I turned my head I didn't have the guts to keep my eyes open. I started to chant (I am hindu and it was a prayer I learned when I was little) and after a few seconds the strangling stopped. I opened my eyes and sat bolt upright in bed.

To this day I get chills when I think of it. I have read about REM but the thing is that I was finally able to turn my head. The strange thing was at the same time when I experienced this, both my mother and brother were having strange and frightening nightmares.

If someone could explain / had a similar experience I would appreciate if you would respond.

The Graveyard 2,"Florida, United States",Misc,"H ere's another on this graveyard I went to as a teen. I was 15 and my sister, her boyfriend, my boyfriend and I all decided to go to the graveyard since mindy's boyfriend was new to the area. My boyfriend was the only one who had a car at the time and was driving a huge van so he met us at our house.

We give mindy's boyfriend, nick, the background of the whole place and showed him the old graves. He thought it was cool and we talked for hours about the history, then on to other things nearby like the Lyke's house (I'll write about that another time). Now the fun part, as we were getting ready to leave, we were helping mike back the van up (the graveyard is in the woods), mindy and I were standing by a small tree telling him to come our way as we thought it was clear, this was the only open area there to back out.

As he backed out, he got stuck on a headstone. how this happened I do not know because mindy and I searched and inspected to make sure that there was no obstacles in the way, either we are both blind as bats or that thing appeared out of nowhere! Then weird things started to happen, things being thrown at us, seeing things. I won't really say anything about the cold spots there because it was early spring and we still had a nip in the air.

Well after about an hour, we finally got off that headstone, begged for forgiveness of the dead, and left. After that, I took super extra care to make sure nothing was near to get stuck on.

The Girl Who Couldn't Figure Out How to Get to Heaven,"Virginia, United States",Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: The Girl Who Couldn't Figure Out How to Get to Heaven

I n the late summer of 1997, my father and mother purchased the old home place that had been in my father's family for over two hundred years. It was a hundred acres of rich, fields that had brought forth the prettiest tobacco, and nestled in the valley was the huge, white, farmhouse. My great grandmother had lived and died in that house, and since her death, the house had remained empty.

When my parents informed us of their decision to buy it, I had mixed feelings about it. The house scared me. It was big, old, and drafty, and at night you could hear things go bump in the night, so I wasn't exactly thrilled with their news. When we pulled up in the gravel, driveway on that Saturday afternoon, I looked up at the looming house and felt a cold chill run down my spine. Daddy knew that I wasn't happy about the move, so he put his arm around my shoulder and told me that I could go in first and pick the bedroom that I wanted. I knew that he was trying to make me happy so I smiled and walked toward the house.

Time passed and we had already been living in the house for two months. The night before Thanksgiving, the house was filled with family from out of town. My dad's mother was one of our guest. When she saw the old house, she looked over at me and asked, ""Have you seen your ghost yet?"" Everybody laughed at her but I didn't and she wasn't laughing either. My grandmother has the gift of being psychic. She can see things and she knows things that will astound you. So when she said this, I took her seriously.

That night after everybody had went to bed, I went upstairs to my room and laid down. I fell asleep but was suddenly woke up when I heard laughing. I rose up and saw the ghostly figure of a little girl. She was standing by my dresser and she appeared to be about the age of five or six. She had long, blond hair that hung to her waist and she wore a white nightgown that had ruffles around the neck and wrist. I tried to scream but it was as if she held me spellbound, I felt paralyzed, and I couldn't move. She made no move toward me but just stared at me. I was scared and pulled my blanket up over my head. My heart pounded in my chest and the temperature felt both warm and cold at the same time, if that is possible. I did not look again to see if she was there.

The next morning I felt so stupid. Had she been a figment of my imagination or had she been real, but even as I questioned myself, I knew that she had been real. I went in search of my grandmother and found her sitting on the back porch. She was old and her hair was snowy white, but her clear, blue eyes were youthful and knowing... ""Have you seen your ghost yet"", she asked again? I looked at her and said that I had. She told me not to be afraid of the girl, because the spirit meant me no harm. I asked her why that she had come to me and she said that she didn't know but that the next time that she came, to ask her what she wanted. I asked grandma how that I could talk to her and she said that she suspected that I had the same gift that she did and that we were a bridge to the supernatural world. This scared me but yet excited me at the same time.

The next two nights passed and I did not see the girl, I stayed up just to see her, but she wouldn't show herself. Grandma told me to be patient and that she would come back, because grandma could feel her presence in the house. The next afternoon I was reading in my room and I heard a sound coming from my closet. I got up from my desk and walked over to the closet fully expecting to find her when I opened the door. I slowly turned the knob and opened the door, but she wasn't there. I was relieved and disappointed.

That night after supper, I told grandma what had happened and she said that the little girl was teasing me. I was a little upset that night and went to bed early. I don't know how much time had went by but I woke to that warm, cold temperature again and I knew that she was there. I looked over toward the dresser and there she was. I was not scared of her this time, I just wanted to help her, so I looked at her and said hello. She just stared at me and then vanished into thin air.

I got up and ran to my grandma's room, she was still awake when I walked in. I told her that I had seen the girl but that she would not say anything to me. She told me that the girl had passed on before she was ready and that now she was lost and couldn't figure out how to get to heaven. I asked grandma if she knew what had happened to her and she said that she had died in a terrible way, that she had been murdered. I asked her to tell me more about the girl. She said that after school one day, the girl was walking home and one of the field hands had grabbed her and took her to a abandoned tobacco barn out in the woods. Grandma said that her father and a bunch of other men had went in search of her when she hadn't shown up for supper and found her the next morning inside the barn, she had been killed. I felt sorry for the girl and told my grandma so, she said that the girl's name was Eliese and that grandma's dad, my great grand dad, had told her the story of Eliese many times. Eliese makes her presence known sometimes. You can hear her laughing out in the hall at night or she may hide something from you, she's quite the prankster. I am not afraid of her, in a way she's comforting.

I have my own family now and have moved to North Carolina, but I visit the home place on holiday, and I'll admit that I hope I catch a glimpse of the little girl.

Watching Me Sleep,Costa Rica,Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: Watching Me Sleep

W e recently purchased a new home in Camby, Indiana, it is in a fairly new neighborhood. The subdivision is called Heartland Crossing. For some strange reason, I feel uncomfortable in the house, I get the feeling that someone is watching me. I am sometimes in the shower and feel like if someone was getting ready to come in the bathroom. It is very strange. I have told my husband about it but he thinks that I am just to stressed out due to work or the kids or school.

Ever since we moved to the house, I cannot sleep the way I used to. It will take me a while before I fall asleep and when I do I wake up during the middle of the night and then in the morning I am exhausted due to lack of sleep.

One night I was having one of those nights where I could not go to sleep. The master bed room, which of course is ours, as you walk into it, the bed is to the left, as you walk towards the bed to the left, there is the master bath and once you are in the bath to the left again is the walk in closet. This is so you can start picturing what my room looks like and so you have an idea of where I saw what I saw.

I was tossing and turning but had my eyes closed. I felt again as if someone was watching me sleep and I opened my eyes and I saw a shadow next to my bed and ""he"" (I say he because the body shape and posture seemed of a man) was like at an incline as if he was trying to see my face which was covered slightly by the sheets. I closed my eyes really quick and started to pray and when I got the courage to open them again, it was no longer there. That wall that was right behind the shadow I saw is in front of two big windows and I don't know if maybe the tree branches was what formed the shape of it, but let me tell you I was so scared! I told my husband a few days after it happened but he just looked at me and did not say anything. I am not sure if he believed me or not, but I saw it.

Other times I have felt as if someone touches my legs under the sheets. I am usually half asleep when this happens and to be honest I though the first time it was my husband trying to get some, but when I asked him the next morning he told me he did not, that he was asleep.

I will tell you about other stories that have happened and I cannot explain. I have tried to find out what was there prior to the subdivision and the people who lived there, but I cannot find anything or maybe just not looking in the right place.

Something Is Watching Me,"Pennsylvania, United States",Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: Something Is Watching Me

B efore my bed room was mine, it was the upstairs living room and even then, I knew that there was something weird about it. So when it became my room... I found out how strange and creepy it really was. I was about 5 or 6 when my Mom and Dad re-did the upstairs living room to make it my new bed room. It was a few months after all the weird stuff started to happen.

When things did start happen in my new room, I got scared and I would go downstairs, tell my mom about it and every time my Mom would just tell me to go back to sleep and it will be fine. I remember lots of things happening in my bed room at night that was ghostly, but the one that still happens to me to this day is having that feeling of someone watching you!

I remember every night before I went to bed, I hated it, because when I went to bed and turned off all the lights, I would lay there in bed with the feeling of someone watching me, knowing that no one was in the room. So I would constantly look up at my door (which was always open) knowing that someone not human was standing there. I knew this thing that was watching me wasn't human, more like a friendly ghost or something. At first I would get so freaked out and go down stairs and tell my Mom and of course the same thing happened, where my Mom told me just to go back to sleep. So after a while I just didn't get that scared by it anymore. I mean, from all the other stuff that was happening to me at that time in that room, there was no reason to get scared anymore!

Of course like every other night, I prepared myself for bed knowing that my friendly ghost was going to watch me, but this night wasn't like all the others, it was different. The feeling or energy that I felt in my room was different. It was like an angry, sadness, depressing feeling and now I really didn't want to sleep in my room! I did anyway and at first, I was just scaring myself and I calmed down, than the feeling of being watched came. But this feeling wasn't like all the others... I felt like a really mean thing was watching me, like it was planning to hurt me or something! It was a really mean and violent thing and I was terrified of it! I knew this wasn't the normal thing that watches me because the normal thing is nice, I could tell and this wasn't!

I was really scared by this time so I looked up at my doorway and I saw this huge black blob standing there! As soon as I looked at it, it quickly zoomed away! The black blob was in a man's shape and not only did it feel evil, it looked evil! I still felt it and I knew it was still there, so I hid under my covers. Or as I like to call it ""blankie forcefield"". I was frozen under the covers for about a minute before I got up and ran as fast as I could out of my room. I told my Mom what happened and she finally let me sleep with her that night.

After that night I never felt that angry sprit again. I still feel that thing watching me when I sleep, but by now I found a way to not feel it. I would just turn on my TV and fall asleep with it on. That seems to always work, but I still don't mind that spirit watching me.

Now that I'm older, my Mom told me a lot of things I used to tell her about spirits or things that I wouldn't normally know, but I do.

Granddad Saved her Life,Bangladesh,Family / Friends Visits,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Family / Friends Visits :: Granddad Saved her Life

N ow you all know from my other story Message from my father that my granddad's still here with us and wants to help us. It all happened probably a month after my granddad passed away. My uncle's wife, his daughter-in-law woke up shouting. My granny and her kids ran to her room asking what happened. She said she had a dream about my granddad.

She was in the kitchen cooking when suddenly fire caught her saree. She tried her best to stop the fire, like pouring water, etc. But nothing worked. The fire was spreading all over her, she said that it felt so real.

Suddenly my granddad came and just grabbed the fire. She hugged him and thanked him for saving her. He said that he was proud to have her as a daughter-in-law and that she was doing a good job on looking after the family (after my granddad's death, my granny went a bit bitter and shouted at everyone for no reason at all. She used to say to my aunty that she's doing a lousy job on looking after the kids. But she didn't mean it).

A few weeks had passed and my aunty made sure she didn't go in the kitchen alone. One day I came over after school to her house just to see my cousins. They were still at school so I decided to help my aunty while I waited for them.

Someone knocked on the door so I went to answer it. It was her daughter and son. We were just talking when we heard her scream. We ran to the kitchen and saw she was on the floor half her saree burnt. She told us that her saree caught the fire from the cooker. She also said that she smelt arabian perfume. I looked through the window and saw someone was standing there. I got out but the person vanished. I opened the garden door but there was no-one there.

The funny thing was I had a dream a few days ago seeing my granddad in my aunty's garden waving goodbye to me. When I opened the garden door he vanished, but I looked ahead and saw the scooter he used to ride was going up the street.

Father / Son Trauma,"Indiana, United States",Misc,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Misc :: Father / Son Trauma

T his is a story my uncle related to me one summer when it became clear that certain members of our family seemed to have a sense for things paranormal. It is well-known that my late grandmother on my mother's side often had prophetic dreams and had encountered ghosts, not only at home in Ohio, but around the world on her vacations abroad, as well. She was certainly a very spiritual woman.

When I was seventeen, I was telling my uncle about the strange occurrences in my family's home in Columbus, Ohio . But this is his story. He believed (unlike many people) every word of it and told me he, too, had felt privy to things usually unseen. His story takes place in a very old farm house out in the countryside near West Lafayette, Indiana. My uncle bought the house in the late 1980s when the house was already well over 100 years old. It was supposedly built around, or slightly after, the Civil War. It was remodeled inside, but still retained many original designs and decorations. It was fairly large (as houses tended to be back then) and was big enough for his family of five.

The first thing that alerted him to something strange in the house was the door to the attic, which is at the top of the stairs going up from the first to second floor. On a few occasions, as he would walk up these stairs, he would watch the door knob start turning slowly as if someone was about to open it from the other side. The door knob would turn all the way, but the mechanism would not click and the door never did open. My uncle would always open the door himself (albeit begrudgingly and with baited breath) and find nothing on the other side.

But that's not even the weirdest thing about the place. Maybe this next bit has less to do with the house and more to do with our family. Then again, maybe something about the grounds was ""charged"" so to speak, with supernatural energy--we just don't have the necessary tools or language to adequately deal with the possibilities, yet.

At any rate, my uncle and aunt were in the midst of a divorce. Like most, it wasn't a pretty one. At this point, my male cousins were about 12 and 10 and my female cousin was only about 2. One night, my uncle awoke to a child crying in his room. He looked over, and there, standing in the open doorway to his room was his oldest son, ""Q..."" The door opened into my uncle's room and Q was standing with his back against the door facing my uncle, but his head was dropped so that his chin was on his chest. My uncle called out his name, but received no response from him. Q then slid down the door to the floor so that he was mostly squatting on the floor with his back against the door and head drooped and crying faintly.

My uncle got out of bed and approached his son trying to comfort him. As he neared the door, he reached down with his left hand to tussle the boy's head and see if he was alright. As my uncle's hand came to Q's head, his hand went right through it and his body simply dissipated into nothing. Without even pausing at the incredible thing that had just happened, my uncle, sensing this was OBVIOUSLY strange, bolted down the hallway to Q's room thinking it was a premonition of death or sickness. He flung open the door to Q's room only to find him sleeping soundly in his bed. My uncle checked on him and everything seemed normal.

My cousin never had any health problems or anything before or since. My uncle suspects it was a manifestation of his son's anguish over the divorce. Perhaps it was ""all in his head,"" but being an internationally esteemed professor at a university, my uncle is highly cerebral and logical and not prone to flights of fancy. Then again, what else could account for such a mysterious engagement? This is not necessarily a ghost story, but it seems to be evidence of some emotional link between family members.

Finding Willis Moon,"Utah, United States",Children Who See Spirits,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Children Who See Spirits :: Finding Willis Moon

I used to work at a rest home called Courtyard at Jamestown , which I have written a story about already. Most of the people I took care of have passed away by now, so when I go for walks in the provo cemetery (which is very often, as it is a nice place for a stroll) I sometimes find someone I used to care for.

One day me and my son were out for a walk, at the time he was about one and still in a stroller. When we reached the cemetery, I let him out of his stroller to stretch his legs, usually he sticks close to me and we just sort of wander around on the road, but on this occasion, he wandered over to some of the head stones and just stopped and stood in front of one of them. I urged him to come with me so I could start getting some exercise in for the day but he wouldn't move. He was only one at the time and a bit stubborn so I didn't really think anything of his not wanting to come to me. I couldn't see the name on the headstone until I got right up to it because it was one of the flat ones, but when I saw the name, I was very surprised.

The grave belonged to one of the sweetest men in the whole world. His name is Willis Moon and he was one of the funniest residents to take care of. He was a sheep hearder and always had a lot of corny jokes to share with all of the CNA's (if he knew you and knew you weren't opposed, he had a lot of dirty jokes that weren't that bad for an old guy).

Once I reached the head stone, my son waited around for a minute while I said ""hi"" to willis and then we went on with our walk. I guess I will never know what made him stop in front of that particular grave, did he see willis, or was this all just a very weird coincidence? Just sort of makes you wonder doesn't it?

Pretty Lady in White Beckoning Me,Philippines,Psychic / Medium,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Psychic / Medium :: Pretty Lady in White Beckoning Me

I have had many experiences with ghosts or the paranormal. I have been told by my uncles and cousins that this is inherent in our family. My grandfather could see and communicate with these ""entities"", my father can feel and see them, I can also feel and see them. This bothered me when I was in a very young age because I could not understand why the people around me could not see them and they were right in front of us. As far as I can remember, my first encounter was when I was 2-3 years old, I know you would say that it's impossible to remember as far as that, but I honestly do.

We lived that time in the city (Cebu City) in a rental house. It was situated in the heart of the city and no one would think that this would occur in a noisy place such as that. As a kid I was really mischievous when it was meal time. I would run around the house and let my nanny run after me. It was during these times that I would see a very pretty lady smiling at me from the top of the staircase. She was all dressed in a pretty white dress. I could not see her face clearly, it seemed like a blur or a mist was covering it but, being a kid, I just ignored it. Despite the way her face appeared I could tell that she was pretty, I felt it more than see it though. I told my nanny about this but she would not believe me and say that no one was there and that it was just my imagination. Well I just took what she said as true because she was an adult.

Now this went on for a few months. Sometimes when I was just watching TV, I would see her smiling and beckoning me. Of course since I do not know her, I would just shake my head and she would leave. Now the most vivid memory that I had was when one day I was in the receiving room playing with my toy cars (if I would look up I can perfectly see the whole staircase). I was just enjoying myself playing with the toys when I looked up I saw her again. She was sitting on the stairs and was calling and beckoning me. I ran away and went out of the house because I was getting scared. When I peeped at the door, she was still on the stairs just smiling as usual. I slowly entered the house and tried to run to the kitchen when I saw her stand up and called me, I was suddenly frozen in place. I could not move, could not scream, I could not even hear anyone else. I saw her starting to move up the stairs and I really felt something bad was happening but did not know what.

When I woke up I was already in the hospital. I was confused as to what had happened. I was really scared and clutched my father. I told them what I saw and felt, but they told me that I was sick and that it was all just a bad dream, but deep inside I knew that it was not a dream and that it really happened. The pretty lady in white wanted to take me with her and that landed me in the hospital.

Later years I retold the story to my mother, she told me that I had a convulsion which caused the hallucination. Come to think of it, a hyper active child, like I was, no sign of even the slightest fever on that day suddenly had convulsions. I attributed it to the experience that I had.

This I confirmed when I was already in 5th grade. By this time we transferred house and we lived next door. It was a bigger and a better house. One night I woke up at around 1am I felt restless and I felt like someone was calling me, even though I could not hear my name. I stood up and drank some water, I had a glass by my bed, then I was just drawn to the window. My room was located on the second floor of the house, so I had a nice view of the small backyard below. On the yard, there is a water tank, beside the tank is a small tree. And there she was, the pretty girl in white beside the tree looking up at me smiling. After all the years she still looks the same. No change at all, still pretty and I could see her face now and she was lovely. She still was beckoning me and still wants me to go with her. But now I know better, I know that she is not from our plane and that going with her would mean my demise.

That was the last time that I saw her but it was not the end of my paranormal experiences. In fact it was just the beginning...

Taking Pictures of Ghosts,Canada,Photographs / Videos / EVP,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Photographs / Videos / EVP :: Taking Pictures of Ghosts

I just recently became interested in the paranormal, so a friend and I decided to go visit her ""friend"" in a local graveyard, she spoke to him and asked if we could take pictures. Also before we left that night, she asked if anyone else was there to go to his grave so we could get pictures of them as well. And we both apologized if we got pics of anyone who didn't want their picture taken.

The friend we went to see was her BEST friend and was in his early 30s when he died, also in this grave yard was a baby boy who was brutally murdered by his mom, he was found in the local river in the 80's, his body and all his belongings including baby bottles were found there.

Not really sure if anything came out in these pictures but thought I would post them anyway.

Then the next day, we went in the afternoon to an old grave yard, dated back to the 1800's, the first daytime picture is the ""whole picture"" the second is a cropped picture, we thought we could see a face but then again we are new to this so are posting them as well. Maybe it is just some kind of reflection? I was told the mind likes to make us think we se faces when we really don't, this is why we are looking for opinions on this.

Also any tips on how to get some pictures would be appreciated.

Touched by the Hand of a Heavily Breathing Ghost,"Colorado, United States",Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: Touched by the Hand of a Heavily Breathing Ghost

M y story happened about 4 years ago. I had moved to New York to start a new life with my then girlfriend Lisa. We wanted to save up some money so we were staying with my mother in the Bronx in an apartment she had recently moved into. The building was probably close to a hundred years old. It was a one bedroom apartment, so my girlfriend and I slept on an air mattress in the living room while my mother slept in the bedroom.

Everything was completely normal for the first few months, then weird things started to happen. My first experience happened to me one night after Lisa and I had laid down to go to bed. I have always had a problem with going straight to sleep, so I was just laying there with my eyes closed when I heard what sounded like someone breathing. At first, I didn't really pay any attention to it because I thought that it was just Lisa, then I heard it again, and again. I asked Lisa why she was breathing so hard but got no response. Lisa was asleep. I decided to investigate the strange noise, but I found nothing. I went into my mother's room to see if maybe she was awake, but she too was sound asleep. A bit baffled, I just decided to go lay back down and after about an hour I finally was able to go to sleep.

The following morning when I woke up, I didn't mention anything about the noise to either my mom or Lisa. A few days had gone by without hearing the noise at night, and then it happened again, only this time it seemed to be louder than the first time that I heard it. I sat trying to figure out what could possibly be making this noise. After about 20 or 30 minutes, it stopped.

The next morning I decided to say something about what I had been hearing. I told my mother and Lisa about it and they both just laughed at me. I asked my mom if she had ever heard anything like that before I had come there and she said no. The next night I was in my mother's room playing my video game while her and Lisa were asleep on my mom's bed. I really wasn't trying to hear that noise again, so I was going to stay in my mom's room until I couldn't keep my eyes open anymore. Out of nowhere, my stereo, which was in the living room, turned on. I was startled by this and didn't want to turn it off, but it was a bit loud so I had to do it. When I got to the stereo, I thought to myself if maybe the alarm on it was on, but it wasn't. I remembered to note the time and it was about 1:30am, the same time that I would hear the breathing. I slept in my mother's room that night.

The next night at bed time Lisa and I were back in the living room. Fearing hearing the noise again, I pulled the sheet over my head. I was laying on my left side and Lisa's back was against mine. All I could do was wait for the breathing to start. Shortly after I pulled the sheet over my head it did, only this time it started to move around the room. It had never done this before. I began to get really scared at this point and I just wanted for it to stop, but it didn't. It started getting louder and closer to me and then it happened. As I laid on my side I felt someone's hand lightly stroke my arm. I was instantly paralyzed by fear. I actually felt fingers stroke my arm through the thin sheet. After that everything stopped.

The next morning, I couldn't wait to tell my mother and Lisa what happened to me in the night, but when I did, I received the same response as the first time. Upset, I decided to take a shower. When I took my shirt off, I noticed that my arm where it had touched me was slightly discolored. I showed this to both my mom and Lisa and they couldn't understand it. They both thought that it was a bit weird, but still they didn't believe me about my experience with what I believe to be a ghost.

It never happened to me again while I stayed in that apartment, but I will never forget about these experiences, and I am thankful to have had the opportunity to share them with all of you. Thank you.

Story of Possession,Puerto Rico,Demons / Possessions / Exorcisms,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Demons / Possessions / Exorcisms :: Story of Possession

I will tell you about the different spirits or demons that have possessed me over the years. My first possession happened when I was 12 years old, it was around 3:00 o'clock and I was taking a nap, suddenly my body starts shaking and I feel paralyzed, I open my eyes and there's this ""thing"" next to me, it was dark green and had no eyes nor lips or teeth, like he was empty inside, he turns to me and yells ""Let me go"", at that moment my paralysis stopped, I opened my eyes and he was gone.

A year after that, I was walking toward my room, my mother's room is to the right of mine, I was alone in the house, when I reached my door I turned to the right and I see this huge ball of light, but I wasn't actually light, it was a white orb, it was around four inches and it was round, it was in the hallway just floating. I kept looking at it for a few seconds without moving, then it started moving towards my mother room, it left like a trail of white light while it moved. The orb entered my mother's room and disappeared.

My next possession happened when I was 16, I was in my room sleeping at night, then my body started shaking, I don't know why but I felt something strange, like anger inside me, I couldn't move or open my eyes and I couldn't talk, I began to pray in my mind and the thing that was inside me left. I opened my eyes and I could see something white floating above me, like some sort of shadow but white, then it rammed me and I started shaking again, this time I could speak and stated praying, whatever it was left my body a second time and disappeared. I kept praying for an hour and slept again.

Another and the most powerful possession happened when I was 22, it was night, I was sleeping and I opened my eyes, something came out of the wall, it was the white shadow again, it entered my body and I started shaking, I couldn't move or talk, I couldn't pray either, somehow I forced that thing out of my body. It floated above me for two seconds and then entered my body again, I don't know why but I could not pray, I forced that thing out of my shaking body and it started floating above me and entered my body again. The same thing happened around 16 times hat night, until it went away, I started sleeping.

The next day I was about to tell my parents what happened, and my father interrupted me, and he says ""hey, last night something happened around two o'clock, I saw this white thing flying very fast thought the room, it went through the wall into the kitchen"" I was in shock that he saw that thing, after I told them what happened to me, they bought a few crucifixes and went to the church so they could be blessed. I haven't had another experience like that in the house.

But it appears that I am game out of the house, I worked in a house for handicapped children and with mental retardation, it was the night shift, we took turns taking a few hours of sleep. That night my friend was asleep, I was in the couch, and I fell asleep too, I don't know what happened, but the neighbors dogs started barking. I was then half sleep, when my body felt paralyzed, the dogs were not barking anymore but grunting and then I heard this laugh, this laugh was so evil, it was mocking me, it happened for a minute then stopped, I wasn't able to sleep that night.

It has been a years since that incident, I been talking to a few people and some says that I have an ""open gate"" to the spirit world that they want to get in and out through my body, others, that it just the devil, and others call it an affinity to the forces around me and that I should learn how to control it. Any suggestion?

Voices 2,British Indian Ocean Territory,Apparitions / Voices / Touches,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Apparitions / Voices / Touches :: Voices 2

I f you have read my other story concerning voices you will know that in the past I have heard my name called and I have heard other voices and sounds that I am unable to account for or explain away. Some I am sure have every day causes, while others I just don't know.

I have another story that follows along the same lines that I wanted to share with my fellow YGS readers and posters. This time I was not the only one to have the experience. This all took place this past Friday, November the 2nd. I was in a meeting with my supervisor and the chief of operations concerning up coming projects and my soon to be departure from the island.

We were the only ones in or around the building as others had taken the day off, were out sick or were off site. We had just pretty much ended our meeting and were sitting around BSing, when out of no where a deep male voice called out ""HELLO"", my supervisor asked ""what was that?"" I told him it was someone calling out Hello. The chief of Ops said he hadn't heard a thing and asked my supervisor what he had heard?

My supervisor said that it had been a deep male voice, but that he wasn't able to make out what they had said. I told him that I had heard the same thing and that to me it sounded like they had said hello. A quick search of the building and the surrounding area confirmed what we had already known, that we were the only ones here.

Finally I can say that I am not the only one to hear something that can not be explained. My supervisor doesn't seem too comfortable discussing the matter, so I am not going to keep pressing him about it. I am just glad that he verified what I had experienced as well.

Thanks for reading this and I am sorry that it wasn't fright filled or overly spooktacular.

Gentle Incubus,Philippines,Succubus / Incubus / Sexual Ghosts,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Succubus / Incubus / Sexual Ghosts :: Gentle Incubus

P lease note that this story is somewhat related to the story I have written ' Ghost That Holds You Down ', the ghost there could be the same ghost here. In October the 2nd, it was around 3 days before my 16th birthday. I was finishing a homework left by our professor in Zoology, I finished it at 10:06 that night; I was really dizzy and tired and no possible way to think of anything other than to sleep. I changed into some comfortable spaghetti top and really short shorts because by that time it was really hot.

All the while I was changing, I heard some sort of creepy giggling I couldn't trace where. Me being really creeped out, I just left a dimmed lamp on so that I could sleep without fear. It was about 11:42 when I suddenly woke up feeling someone was sitting on the edge of the bed mattress, I went to sleep again but leaving 1/4 of my consciousness sensed on. (I am trained to sleep lightly whenever I want to, please don't make any predicament that it's impossible). My consciousness sensed some sort of presence, not violent or cold, just a presence but not really being there. My consciousness would only last an hour to let something be caught by my senses. It was about 20 minutes that someone or something suddenly laid down very closely beside me (I mostly face only one direction when I sleep, I don't face front much nor face back), it was right behind me; the dimmed lamp made some semi transparent shadow behind me. I assumed it was a man since the shadow I saw was larger than mine. Seeing this, I surely got a wake up call.

This ghost was somewhat combing my hair with its fingers. It was also embracing me within my waist and I could feel something at the rear of my thighs and ankles, as if it was really cuddling me, like it was in love. I wasn't so sure what I would do, I can't use my taekwondo skill now, could I? It wasn't so easy dealing with lost souls or fallen angels. When I tried to move a little, the feeling suddenly disappeared. Now I turned and laid on my back. Now this is the part that got really shocking, this ghost made the room more hot. In my condition, I could stand highly cold temperatures but not hot. I momentarily ignored the ghost and positioned my body more openly so that air could reach through some of my body parts. As in the position in 'Ghost That Holds You Down' it was a the same with a little difference, my legs weren't that apart also my arms. I felt something lingering from my ankles, to my things, to my waist, to the top of my chest, and finally at the left side of my neck. Those areas of my body had a simultaneous feeling of something leaning back and forth...

I felt something enter my... vagina... in and out, simultaneous with the lingering feeling outside my body... I was practically being raped... Unlike the 'Ghost that Holds You Down' story, this one was damned straight real, so real like I was having sex with a real person. I had an orgasm, I couldn't struggle like something was holding down my whole body, but no pain was applied. I WAS a virgin before this constantly happened. I saw the ghost with my eyes wide open. The motion was same but it wasn't as violent as the 'Ghost That Holds You Down' story.

There were nights when it only wanted to rock me to sleep, combing my hair and somewhat massaging a shoulder ache away and at nights when it only wanted to cuddle with me. Although it was unnaturally comforting, I sometimes got a flu or a migraine when I woke up, constantly getting sick. I don't know why I get sick, I'm a healthy person, how could I get easily sick? I guess it's really a mystery...

Thank you for letting me convey this... I want opinions on whether to get this ghost expelled or not. Please comment on this, I really need opinions.

Ella,"South Dakota, United States",Psychic / Medium,"M y Mom and my Mom's Mom (Nanny) and her Mom all have had the ability to feel energy of sprits. It is amazing to hear their stories about what they have experienced. I do not think that it is inherited to be able to feel spirits but I do think that families that do not discredit what they are feeling will have children that will not be discouraged to welcome the feeling. This is a story of my first time that I remember a spirit encounter.

When I was in third grade my mom, dad, brother, and myself moved to Plankinton, South Dakota. I am now 22 years old and can just start to tell people about this experience again. We moved into an old township schoolhouse. Before we could move in it needed to be cleaned. On one of our trips over to the house to clean it, my dad and I were touring the country around our house and came upon an old abandoned house. Even as a third grader I remember thinking how beautiful the house must have been back when people lived in it. The next time that my mom came to clean and I was with, I took her by the house that we had discovered. She looked at it and a sense of fright but also peace came over her face.

The next time we went back to Plankinton my mom's boss, Brenda, and her husband, Dan, came with us to help with the cleaning. When we finished, we took Brenda and Dan by the house. When she saw it, she said that she wanted to go inside. We did not figure it could be any harm to go into the house so she when in. This was the first time any of us had gone into the home. When she came out onto the balcony I remember thinking this was odd when she said, ""This house will be mine."" We did not know what she was really talking about at the time. On our way home to Mitchell she told us about when she was about half way up the stairs she heard footsteps coming up behind her. She thought it was her husband so she called out ""Dan"" but he was not there. Then for some reason she said ""Ella?"" This is when my mom revealed that when she first saw the house, she felt children playing ring around the Rosie in the front yard. Soon we found the owner of the land and the house and Brenda asked if she could take the lumber from the house for her store. The owner said that this would be fine because he had been planning on burning down the house to make room for farmland. Soon after that, we started to go to the house more frequently.

One time we took my Aunt Jan and Uncle Dan here. When my aunt came upstairs, she found me talking to someone. There was not anyone in the room. When I saw her, I took her to another room and I explained that there was a mother in the room holding a baby and they looked so sad.

One thing about the house was that every time that a male tried to enter the house, something would happen to them. Brenda's husband, Dan, tried to enter the first time and he was cut by a nail in the doorway. He was cut so deep that it was borderline if he needed stitches or not. My dad tried to enter and he was struck by anger and left the house because of this feeling. When the construction people came to start taking lumber from the house, they soon came back to Mitchell and told Brenda that they could not do it. We had never told them anything about what we had experienced with the house but they said they just felt unwelcome there.

One day while we were out there, we took some pictures of the house. When the newspaper heard of this story, they wanted to run a story on the house and our experience. When the writer asked if they could go out and take pictures Brenda said, ""Yes, that should be fine."" When my mom when to pick up the pictures we had already taken she go burned on her finger tips. She then told Brenda, ""Ella does not want him there."" They ended up using one of the pictures that we had already taken.

After the article was published, a man came to visit the store and had a story to tell us. He was a grandson of the owners of the house. He told us that his great aunt that was born there, her name was Ella. We had not told the writer about my encounter of the mom holding a baby so this was not published. When the man was telling us more about the house, he told us that also in the house a mother giving birth to a baby. The baby had died soon after the birth as well. He was in complete disbelief that we knew so much about the house without ever talking to anyone that was alive or without doing any research about the house. In addition, he told us about why men probably were not welcomed into the home. He told us that the women and children lived in the house that we had been in and the men lived in a separate house. This was so that then men were not disturbed by the children. These houses were lived in my more than one family. He thinks there were about three families that lived in these two houses. This was so that they could farm more land and have more food.

Soon after we took Brenda to the house, she had been consumed with jealousy about everything. My mom had worked for Brenda for 8 years. It was a strong relationship before this as they were the only two running the antique consignment shop. Brenda was always a wonderful boss until this time. One day my mom picked me up from school. This was different because I would usually ride the bus. I soon found out that Brenda had fired my mom after they got into a huge fight. Since then my parents said, that Ella was a bad spirit and they did not want me talking about her anymore. It was hard at first because the house was only 2 miles from our house. If it were not for the shelterbelt of trees, we would be able to see it from our house.

Since then, I have experienced other energy in places. I try to welcome them because sometimes they are trying to tell me something. Some of them are an uneasy feeling. The ones in our house sometime were uneasy feeling. I have also met spirits that are just here to comfort us. When a classmate died on our graduation day, I felt a sweet spirit there at the school during pictures and during the ceremony. This is just a few instances of when you feel them around. It is difficult to tell people about what I have experienced because most people in South Dakota are very traditional in what they think and do not think that this could really happen. I know however, what I felt and to have that man come in to the store to confirm what we had felt.

It All Started Around the Time I Conceived,"Arizona, United States",Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: It All Started Around the Time I Conceived

F irst I need to let everyone know that I was NOT asleep when these encounters have happened. My husband and I have lived in our house for a little over a year now, it's a BRAND NEW home, we're the first ones to live in it. For about 3-4 months now, strange things have been happening.

It started with the TV changing channels, or turning on. Then I noticed small things out of place. That started in about August. Since it was just me noticing these things, I thought it was my imagination, because I'm TERRIFIED of ghosts. When I was about 5, a spiritual advisor (a friend of the family) told my mom that I had the gift to be psychic and was able to communicate with spirits. Hearing that when I was a child freaked me out, and I'm still scared of everything. I mean I'm going to be 22 years old and I'm terrified of the dark! So these strange things started going on in around aug-sept. I told my husband and he thought I was crazy.

About 3-4 weeks ago, I woke up at 5am, and got a drink, went back to bed in the spare bedroom, was lying there, when I felt as though something entered my body. I tried screaming, and I could feel my mouth moving, but no more that a whisper would come out. It felt like gravity was forcing me down on the bed. And it was very cold. It lasted maybe 3min, then I felt like I could breathe again, however it did get very hot. I yelled for my husband, and told him what happened. He thought I had a nightmare, and walked with me back to our bed.

As we were walking through the kitchen, I saw a little boy standing on my table wearing a suit that was too big. I literally thought I was crazy. Since that night every time I feel a cold spot, or things are just not normal at home, I say go away or leave me alone. My husband then started hearing music. At first he thought it was the neighbors, but when he'd get out of bed, it would stop. Just last night he heard it again for the 5th time asked me if I heard it. And I didn't. He woke up at 5am to get ready for work, and I was totally awake and talking to him. He left to take a shower, and I started hearing music, like it was being played inside. But when I tried to get up, I felt like gravity was forcing me on the bed and it was very cold again, and the music got louder. I tried screaming again nothing but a whisper. I then started praying, and fighting to get up. And it stopped after 3-4mins.

I told my husband and I described to him the same music he's been hearing. I don't know what to do. I'm scared mostly because I'm 4 months pregnant, and I don't want anything hurting my baby. Is it weird that this all started around the time I conceived.

A Sleepless Night,"Oklahoma, United States",Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: A Sleepless Night

A lot of people that came to my house had experiences they cannot explain. Such as seeing things or hearing stuff, but I have not experienced anything like this before and I was hoping I wouldn't. Well one night back in January my family and I just got back from Oklahoma City and I got a new cell phone. I was real excited because this phone was really expensive. Later after everybody had gone to bed, I was still up texting friends and listening to music. Just as I was about to fall asleep I thought I heard someone walking past my doorway and towards the living room, so I got up to see if it was my dad or my mom, because they usually get up to check on me and my brothers.

After I got up and looked, no one was up, so I thought I would try to go to sleep and forget about it. While I was laying in my bed, not even five minutes after I had laid down, I heard someone say my name, like they were trying to whisper to me. It really freaked me out, because after I heard that, I had this feeling that someone was in my room. I laid there still, I was too scared to get up and go to my parents room or anywhere, that's how scared I was.

After a couple of minutes, I heard my mom in the kitchen, so I got up and told her what had happened. When I was telling her, I didn't realize I was crying. My mom believed me and woke my dad up and told him what had happened. Right after she had told him, he got up and told me to wait in their room with my mom, me being Native American, he went to get some cedar and burn it so he could smoke the house. When he was doing that, my mom and I were sitting on their bed talking and in their room, there is a bathroom so that door was closed the whole time we were talking. All of a sudden that door opened and then it slammed shut. After that I kind of froze and said nothing the rest of that night.

After I had that experience, stuff happened to me once in awhile but nothing like this. I will never forget that night, it was like a dream but it wasn't, it actually happened.

The House on Cambridge 2,"Ohio, United States",Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: The House on Cambridge 2

S o this second part to my first story, The House on Cambridge , and it picks-up where the first left-off -- about a month into having just moved-in. To bring you up-to-date, even before we bought the place, my mother had seen and heard things which were not there upon further investigation. My stepfather was beginning to question my mother's sanity a little. Nobody else had really experienced anything out of the ordinary but her at this point. That is until my little brother, J, started complaining about ""the white lady...""

It's difficult to relate this story now because it all started in the early 1990s and most was kept hidden from the children in the family to avoid scaring them. However, my brother, J, had no such luck as the entities in the house took an almost instant shining to him (pardon the pun). There may be some discrepancies in the timeline, but I'll do my best to remain accurate.

I believe it was that first autumn that we moved-in in 1991 that my little brother who was about six years old at the time came into my parents' room one night and said exactly this, ""that lady won't leave me alone..."" At first, neither parent was too alarmed over this as children have vivid imaginations. Mine was so active that as a child, I often related dreams to my parents the next morning as adventures I'd actually experienced the previous day. At any rate, that first night, they took him back to his room and put him back in bed. He slept the rest of the night without any problems.

But within a few days, J was back in my parents' room in the middle of the night complaining that ""the woman"" was keeping him awake. This time, she was supposedly pulling down his sheets and waking him up. At this point, my mother thought this was an awfully specific bit of information coming from a first grader, but my stepfather was unruffled. Again, they took him back and tucked him into bed.

This went on rather regularly for the next several weeks, until one night my brother upped the ante when he informed my parents very loudly at 4 AM one night that ""she"" was tickling him. At this point, my mother was keenly aware of something going on and even my stepfather started to wonder what was really going on with his son. Again, they put him back in his bed, but this time, my mother expressed to my stepfather her belief that something supernatural was occurring in their house. Her experiences in conjunction with J's lended credibility to this stance in her eyes, but my stepfather was still, not only skeptical, but totally unbelieving. If you have never experienced something supernatural, it is virtually impossible to believe it. You may believe in ghosts without having seen one, but until you come into direct contact with them, it's just a different story.

Both my parents were awoken on a few occasions to the sound of someone walking around the landing of the second floor at about 4 AM some nights. Upon inspecting these noises, there would, of course, be nobody there. Both would hear this, but, because we had seven people living in a very old house, my stepfather would chalk it up to random kids out of bed and creaky floors.

My brother would creep into our parents' room with some regularity throughout his childhood complaining of ""the lady in [his] room..."" But it was not until one afternoon the next summer that my mother felt absolutely sure that she was not crazy and that there really was a spirit sharing the house with us.

One afternoon, my brother, J, was out in the front yard hitting whiffle golf balls. My mother was inside cleaning the foyer which, of course, is the first space you enter upon coming in the front door which was made of glass. All at once, in mid-swing, she saw my brother freeze, drop his club and come racing in the front door. Perplexed by his sudden moves and pained look on his face, she asked him what was wrong. He replied, ""they keep saying my name and asking me to play with them,"" or something along those lines. It was a long time ago and nobody wrote this down verbatim, but the crux of this anecdote is that his first name was whispered in his ear and he was implored to join in a game. And he was visibly upset. At this point, my mother was adamant that her house was haunted and split no straws over the fact with my stepfather.

My stepfather would eventually be convinced of the possibility of a haunting (and then some), but that story will have to comprise part III.

Hitch Hiker Lady,"Arizona, United States",Apparitions / Voices / Touches,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Apparitions / Voices / Touches :: Hitch Hiker Lady

I n November of 2005, my then 2 month old daughter had come down with a common cold and had it for about 2 days and she wasn't feeling too well, so I went to sleep along side her at around 10:00 PM. I was worried about her and debated if I should take her to the hospital, the nearest one being about 30 miles away from where we live. But since she didn't have a fever and she appeared to be fine, I didn't want to waste a trip to ER and I just thought to wait it out and let the cold run its course.

Around after 12:00 at midnight, I woke up and she was very hot to the touch and she couldn't even cry because she was so weak. I had no thermometer and didn't take her temperature but she was hot enough to know that it could be dangerous for a child that young. I gave infant Tylenol to my baby before we left to see if that would help, but being a paranoid mother, I decided that we should still go to the hospital. I asked my sister to go with me and we left at around 12:30 am.

The wait at the hospital took hours, but I was also very relieved that her fever went down. I thought to just leave and go home because I was so tired, but I wanted to be sure she didn't have any other infection so we continued waiting for the doctor to see her.

By the time it was our turn, it was nearly 4:00 in the morning. She got checked and turned out everything was fine with my daughter and we left around 4:40 am.

As we were about into 20 minutes of driving home, I noticed a figure alongside the road. We were maybe about 50 feet away. I thought it might just be some livestock walking about because that isn't unusual around there. When I first saw it, I thought it was 2 cows standing beside one another, but as I got closer and the headlights shone more light on it, it was clearly a young woman standing there. Not just any common woman though. This woman was dressed in her finest, like she was going to a special event. The area where we live is on the Navajo Indian reservation and this woman appeared to be a young Navajo woman at around the age of her middle 20's. She was a wearing an ankle length skirt, a velveteen blouse, a turquoise necklace, and her shiny black hair was neatly combed back and tied into a Navajo style hair bun. She also wore a Pendleton shawl around her shoulders and she was pointing out her thumb indicating she was hitchhiking and wanted a lift. But this was so unusual! No one wears that style for no reason unless they're going somewhere that would require it and this was out in the middle of nowhere. It was dark, cold, in the middle of a long stretch of highway, at 5:00 am in such a formal attire. It was very strange.

So I slowed down a little and my sister and I got a good glimpse of her. It was kind of creepy and we didn't want to stop and pick her up so we drove past her. When we looked back she wasn't there. This really creeped both of us out and my heart started beating so hard and fast. I sped up so we could get home more quickly.

When we got home I told my mother about what we saw. She said in that area before it ever became a highway, there used to be a mother and daughter who lived there and the daughter had become very ill and she died at around the age of her mid 20's. She was buried within that area we saw the young woman hitch hiking. We believe it was her ghost that we saw. Since she died an untimely death so young, we believe her spirit still lurks around where she lived and where she was buried.

I never did believe in ghosts all that much but now I know they walk among us and at times we see them. After that incident my sister and I dubbed that area of highway ""The Haunted Road"".

White Things Flying by my Eyes,Canada,Old Hags / Night Attacks / Sleep Paralysis,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Old Hags / Night Attacks / Sleep Paralysis :: White Things Flying by my Eyes

I was staying over at my girlfriend's house and we went to bed at around midnight. I fell asleep right away and woke up a couple of hours later to a strange noise outside. I woke my girlfriend and we both realized it was just the wind, because the trees were waving back and forward pretty hard.

She went back to bed but I somehow had a strange feeling. I was feeling really hot and my girlfriend had 3 blankets on her sleeping. My stomach felt really weird, however I tried going back to sleep. I was uneasy and kept hearing things. I closed my eyes and a little while later I saw white things flying by my eyes. I had them closed and it felt like they where going through my body. I had a tingling and a weird feeling throughout my body. I got freaked out and opened my eyes. I tried to move but couldn't. I tried screaming to wake up my girlfriend but nothing came out of my mouth. Finally after trying about two times to say something I was able to move and woke up my girlfriend. I talked to her about it and she said I was probably dreaming it. I am very sure I was awake, because I tried looking around and moving.

I still get that weird feeling when I go down to the basement where we slept that night. We slept there before quite a few times and nothing ever happened. Can anyone explain or tell me what that might off been or what happened to me, because it is still troubling me. Thank you

Face in the Window,"Ohio, United States",Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: Face in the Window

T his happened recently so it's still fresh in my mind. I had recently moved into a new house with an upstairs that's very beautiful, and for a full two weeks I hadn't noticed anything odd about the house, until about the third week when I would hear low whispering sounds at night. It was so low I wasn't be able to identify what was being said, but it still creeped me out. I had put it aside because I know all houses have their little noises, so I tried to put the idea of ghost behind me.

Another week had gone by where all I would hear is weird noises of things I couldn't explain. One night I even heard someone said my name, I ran downstairs to see what my mother wanted, only to find out that she never even called my name. I started to feel like I was going crazy, but my parents assured me this was all in my head and that I had only imagined these things in my head. I knew they were wrong but I pretended to agree with them.

That night I was tired and decided to go to bed early, I had gotten under the covers and closed my eyes but for some reason I felt like something was watching me, so I opened my eyes and looked around, and through the window I saw a face staring right at me, an old face that seemed angry and full of hate. I looked at it moved swiftly away from the window.

The next morning I didn't even bother telling my parents because I knew they wouldn't believe anyway, but I didn't care because I knew what I saw and nobody could tell me different.

La Llorona (The Weeping Lady),Mexico,Apparitions / Voices / Touches,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Apparitions / Voices / Touches :: La Llorona (The Weeping Lady)

T his story goes way back before I was born, my uncle told us the story one Christmas day, when I was like 7 years old. He told us that when he and his work friends went to a bar to relax after a hard day at work, he saw the scariest thing in his entire life. All his friends went home before him and he stayed to drink more, it was already passing mid-night and he had to walk home, it was dark and it was a long way.

When he got near to the ravine, he saw a lady in white weeping and crying looking down, standing at the edge of the ravine, so he said ""Are you ok? Be careful, you're going to fall"" but no words came out of her. My uncle describe her, he said she was wearing a long white dress and she had no feet (actually floating in the air) he could only see her back. After a few seconds my uncle felt really bad and he started backing up, her weeping became louder and louder, then she turned around and my uncle scream, her face was indescribable and she had horse legs (she was part human and part animal).

After that, he never walked alone at mid-night around the ravine, he said that, at night he could hear her weeping soft in the air and he still gets the chills down his spine. People say that when you hear the weeping lady far far away, she is right outside your house or near you, and when you hear her really close and loud is because she is far away.

Things that Go Bump in the Middle of the Afternoon,"Indiana, United States",Poltergeists / Physical Manifestations,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Poltergeists / Physical Manifestations :: Things that Go Bump in the Middle of the Afternoon

I was at home alone one afternoon with my infant son. My son was about 10 months old at the time. He had fallen asleep in his bouncer downstairs in the living room as he often does. I was upstairs dusting and sweeping the bedrooms. I always keep the doors double locked when I am home alone, even during the day. We live in a small town, but, we live on the main drag of town and occasionally have runs of break-ins in our county. A friend of mine had called while I was cleaning, so, I was talking to her as I worked upstairs.

I heard some noises coming from the kitchen. I was immediately concerned and alerted my friend who I was talking with. She told me to quietly walk down while I had her on the phone and check things out. I was freaked out because my baby was down there alone! I went downstairs and no one was there, all the doors were still locked and my baby was still sound asleep. The noises sounded like dishes clanging and my trash can (which is a heavy metal step can) opening and closing. I thought I was just crazy and went back upstairs and continued cleaning. Once again, I heard the mysterious noises and once again went down and checked on my baby who was still sound asleep. No one was around and no sign of anything being disturbed. So, I went back upstairs.

I wasn't up there long when I heard my baby screaming at the top of his lungs. I ran down the stairs as fast as I could and in the living room where he was. He was standing up straight in his bouncer, stiffened up, and turned toward the door behind him just freaking out. That is when I noted the door to be unlocked and wide open! I was still on the phone with my friend and could barely even tell her what had just happened! I was totally freaked out!

This is just one of the many experiences I've had in my home. I plan to share more at a later time. My home is at least one hundred years old. We live in a very historic town with lots of old homes.

We Are Not Alone in our Flat,United Kingdom,Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: We Are Not Alone in our Flat

W e moved into our flat in December 2001; I fell in love with instantly. The previous tenant had died in the October of 2001. She had lived here for 40 years.

Within weeks of us moving in, I was hearing footsteps going up and down the hallway. I could hear a man and woman conversing in the kitchen just to name a few of the incidents. Six months after we moved in, I woke to see a young girl of five years of age standing next to my side of the bed. I recall she was holding a doll, and she was looking at me like I was her mother.

Recent events include photographing a face, orbs and even recording e.v.p.s in our flat. I have seen a woman's apparition, been smacked on my backside including other activity.

I did some research on our property, and it turns out that where our flat stands was part of a property that belonged to a Barnabas Felton who died suddenly in his home in the 1800's. I live in a block of four flats which are positioned exactly where his house stood.

Barnabas Felton died from a heart attack shortly after going bankrupt. He named the close where I live now. He must still feel connected. I am not frightened by the events, including being shouted at by a disembodied voice.

Bedroom Visitor,Philippines,Old Hags / Night Attacks / Sleep Paralysis,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Old Hags / Night Attacks / Sleep Paralysis :: Bedroom Visitor

G ood day everyone. Like many other people here, I also have my third eye opened. I can sense ghosts, but I do not see them at all times. What is worst is that I can sometimes feel their emotions. My story happened when I was having a nap in my room on a hot afternoon.

Since it was a very bright afternoon, I turned off the light in my room and set my mobile phone to alarm at exactly 3 pm. After dozing off and at the state of being half asleep and half awake, I felt someone was standing on my feet. A black entity that is somewhat wearing a cape was looking at me. I felt him going near me and the closer he gets to me, the more I could not shout or move my body. Until he was looking at me face to face. I could not clearly see his face but I felt really powerless against him. I recited prayers but I could not complete any of it. Luckily, my phone alarmed at 3 pm and it vibrated on top of my tummy. I woke up sweating but feeling really cold. I immediately stood up and ran to my mom's room. I told her what happened and she said that she already felt that black entity lurking in our house.

After that incident, I regularly felt presence in our house. As if there were some other people aside from us. Scary.

"My Dad Is Everywhere, I Tell Ya","New York, United States",Family / Friends Visits,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Family / Friends Visits :: My Dad Is Everywhere, I Tell Ya

W hen I was eating dinner with my whole family in the dining room, one of the lights on the chandelier would flicker. My grandma said ""Oh, that's Merrit..."" I was like, huh? ""This was Grandpa Irving's chandelier and after he died, it would flicker and your dad said it was him saying hi. Now that your father has passed away, I think it's him..."" I was so happy. My dad is in my house!

Then my dad got annoying... His ""spirit"" moved to the chandelier in the kitchen, and whenever I do my homework, one light flickers. One time I was fighting with my mom and the light flickered. I said ""Stop it!"" and it stopped and my mom looked at me like I was crazy. Then it flickered again. My sister turned off the light and turned the light bulb and then it stopped. Then a minute later, it started up again. It actually got on my nerves after a while.

My dad also came into my math classroom. My teacher was writing on the blackboard and then the overhead moved right next to me. She turned around and saw it was moved. She pulled down the white slide sheet and then when she walked away, it went right back up. I laughed. I think my dad did it because I was bored and wanted to make me laugh.

I know this is all my dad's doing because it always something that relates back to him. Oh well. I don't really want to get rid of him, I like it. I just wanted to show you an updated story of my dad and I.

My Father-in-Law,"Indiana, United States",Misc,"I would like to start out by saying that I do not know if this is a ghost story, angel account or a hallucination brought on by the grips of the late stages of lung cancer. To me it has been a comfort as well as a confusing instance. To make it even more interesting, this happened on the very first real day in our new home where we now reside.

My father-in-law was taken to the Emergency room here in Elkhart last November with flu like symptoms that would simply not go away. Being in his seventies, we thought he just needed a stronger medication than we were able to get over the counter. He has a strong dislike for doctors. Medical treatment should be given by a Medicine man and he was very angry with us as doctors just want money. They do not care about your health physically or spiritually so we had a time getting him there to begin with.

After a battery of tests it was found that he had an advanced stage of lung cancer and the doctor refused to release him on the grounds that he felt Dad may not make it very much longer. On that vote of confidence, we brought him back home. He had been living with us since our daughter was in kindergarten and this is his home. Wherever that dwelling might be, this is where he belonged.

Dad outlasted all of the doctors estimated time lines. Slowly his health declined and we were able to get his Medicine man to come out to the house to treat him only a couple of times this last year. With the help of hospice, we were able to give him the care that was needed, but he then required twenty-four hour care. The economy being what it is, we could not afford to pay for an in home nurse and a live in facility was out of the question. So I became his primary caregiver.

In essence, he became my child. I changed him, fed him (when we could find something he was able to keep down), encouraged him, complained with him and loved him just as I do my daughter and son. I carried him when he could not walk any longer and told him no one else really mattered when none of his other fifteen children would come out and visit. I never left the house unless someone else was present, which caused strain on my family as there were plays, college entrance seminars etc., that I was unable to attend. But this is where I was meant to be at this point in my life. God kept me here for a reason.

We had one load of belongings to bring over here on the third of this month, so we decided to call it quits for the night and sleep in our new home (we had to move, we were relying on my husband's paycheck and that was just not quite enough). At two thirty in the morning, my four year old came running into my husbands and my room announcing that Papa told him there was someone in the house and he was to come get me or my husband. My son chose me.

Without question I got up and searched our entire home and came up with nothing so I just started opening boxes and unpacking, while watching Dad. He said the ""someone"" was about six foot tall, walked through here with confidence and said nothing when he walked past Dad. Dad felt comfort, not fear. We left a light on wherever Dad slept as he had developed a fear of the dark, and if I had to quickly get to him there would be no obstacles. It could not be a case of Dad not being seen.

We brought the last load in and said goodbye to the old homestead to begin new life here the morning of the fourth. Dad asked me if I liked my new home and if I felt safe here. I assured him that I did and thought he would also. Dad got worse. By four in the afternoon he was speaking a language I do not know while looking intently into my eyes. He pointed to my son, so I walked out of the room and sent him in.

My four year old and Dad were ""conversing"" and I had no clue what was going on. We called in the hospice nurse at seven but by seven thirty Dad was gone. I apologize, this is still very fresh, so emotions overcome me as I write this. The nurse has no explanation as to what went on between my son and my father-in-law, she has never seen or heard this before. The Medicine man feels my child was preparing another ""child for entry into a new family"" and the pastor thinks Dad was speaking in tongues.

What about the being that Dad saw in our home? Did he see my husband walking through earlier and misplace time when telling my son to get us? Surly he would have recognized him. In all the time I knew Dad, he was a firm believer in the spirit going directly to Heaven or purgatory and NOT walking the earth for any stretch of time. What were my son and his Papa discussing? And what were they speaking? My son, bless him, says he will tell me when I'm ready.

Shadow Visits,Canada,Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: Shadow Visits

O ne summer evening, mid-June 2007, I was out on the back deck with my husband. The sun was down but it was still light enough to see just fine. We were relaxing a bit after some yard work and hubby got up, crossed halfway across the deck to grab a cigarette. From my point of view, he was crossing right to left.

As I looked up at him, I saw a shadow moving left to right all the way down the side of the garage. It seemed about midway up the wall and when it passed the point where there was a deck post in my line of sight, it disappeared behind it, just the way it would look if I saw a person walking by. I watched it travel along the wall, it wasn't zipping along nor was it moving particularly slow. I'd say maybe faster than a man would walk. I had enough time to notice that it didn't seem the size of a man, not as tall, and I could see the shadow all the way to the ground. It also moved in a smooth motion. When I noticed it and as I watched it, I had the strangest feeling of fear. I kind of felt my heart race a little and then it took me a moment to calm down. This was a different experience from other encounters I have had, before and since that incident.

I've seen a lot of shadowy figures and heard movement when no one was there. I very often see shadows in my hallway outside of the living room. This happens day or night, whether I'm home alone or not. I will see a shadow pass the doorway and sometimes it seems as if it stops just down the hall and stays for a moment, like it's watching me. Other times I'll see a shadow standing at the doorway of the living room, just standing. When I look directly at it most of the time it's gone but, now and then I see it go off down the hall. I've also seen a shadow cross inside the doorway to my reading room, which is at the end of the same hall.

Similarly, I've heard floors creaking as if someone is walking through the dining room and kitchen. My kids have heard walking in the basement, while they've been in the room. One incident in particular, the first time I really gave it any thought, (I mean, after all, houses settle and floors creak), was during a quiet afternoon. My kids were at school and hubby was out, doing what hubbies do. I was reading in the living room, enjoying the book and the quiet equally, and I heard walking through the dining room and through the kitchen, which leads to the hall and living room. I thought my husband was home but, we have an alarm system that does 3 peeping sounds when the door is opened and closed and I hadn't heard that sound, which was unusual. I thought I must have been really absorbed in my book not to have heard it. I wondered what he was doing in the kitchen so quietly, I didn't hear the water run or the fridge open. I expected him to pop his head around the door to say 'hi' as he usually does when he comes in. After a couple of minutes, curiosity got the better of me and I went to see what he was doing, but there wasn't anyone in the room. I was so sure that he had come home that I walked through the kitchen and dining room, to the back door and opened it to see if the van was in the driveway. When I opened the door, the alarm made its usual 3 peeps and the van wasn't in the driveway. Then 3 more peeps when I closed the door. The sounds I had heard were exactly like someone walking from the back door, through to the living room, even though no one was there.

I've got some more to share when I can get the time to sit down and write! Thanks for reading my story.

Banging on the Walls,"Indiana, United States",Poltergeists / Physical Manifestations,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Poltergeists / Physical Manifestations :: Banging on the Walls

A s you all know, I have been telling you about a few things that have happened to me in the past and some recently. I have to say that the majority of the time, I am not scared except for the time that I had someone watch me while I slept (which I'm sure you all have read). Usually I try to find a more ""sane"" approach thinking that maybe it was this or maybe it was that. I guess the majority of us would do that but this time everything that I thought might be turned out not to be so I have no idea what it was.

On Friday I was at home with a migraine which I suffer from. I had not had one for a while but on Thursday night it started. It was so bad that on Friday I called in to work and said that I was not coming in. I did have to get up close to Lunch time to drop off my Daughter's lunch at school, since my sweet Hubby was too lazy to pack for her.

It was about 10:00am when a noise woke me up. I opened my eyes and kind of focused to where I was. For all of you that have had at least one migraine in their life know why I say this, for those of you who don't, you really can't think or focus or anything, it's like you're numb. So, I am trying to listen and wake up at the same time when I hear it again. It was like a bang and a dragging but it was as if they were doing it against a wall. At first I thought it was my dog in the kitchen playing with something. Then I heard it again and it sounded as if it were coming from upstairs in my daughter's bedroom.

I was really awake and ready to get out of bed to go see what it was it stopped. I then blew it off and took a shower, I did not hear anything or feel anything that I normally do.

On Sunday I was helping my Daughter clean her room and pickup and I did not see anything on the floor that would have made that noise. I even checked a few things and rolled them on the wall to try to figure out the noise but nothing. I often wonder if they even know that someone is in the house or that can hear and see things that they do. Kind of like the movie ""The Others"" (warning movie spoiler!) where they did not know they were dead and other people where now living in their house . These are things I often wonder.

I have more stories to tell I just had that one happen recently and so I decided to tell you this one.

The Beginning of It All,"Massachusetts, United States",Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: The Beginning of It All

I 've told you before how my Ex Mother in Law's house was a little, ummm ""creepy"", so I figured I'll tell you where it all started. My ex mother in law was cleaning out the attic of her new house before she officially moved in. There were some strange things left behind by the former owner who was more or less forced out of his home by his children, and moved into a nursing home to be cared for.

It was a large house, with a 1/2 finished basement, 3 full bedrooms, and a somewhat finished attic that was spilt into 3 rooms, a storage area and two bedrooms. She was tidying up the place, and found an old milk crate filled with some religious books, she had no idea what religion, but she was VERY catholic and didn't want them in her home. Upon further investigation, she said it looked like the were some black magic type of books. So she put them in the pile that would be tossed out later on when her husband got home to help.

While up in the attic, she uncovered a box with a beautiful porcelain doll inside it. She picked it up and noticed it was in great condition despite its obvious age, and thought she would hang on to it, possibly have it appraised and see if it was worth anything. It was clearly an antique and had incredible detail. She sat the doll on top of some other boxes to keep it from getting damaged in her cleaning attempts. As soon as she put the doll down and turned to finish working, she heard a large inhale followed by a slow, steady exhale coming from the direction of where the doll sat. She said the hair on the back of her neck stood up and she had goose bumps all over. She turned around praying to see her husband or one of her kids behind her, but unfortunately, she was all alone in the house. She shoved the doll back in the box, threw it on the floor and left the house and waited until her husband got home and promptly sent him to the new house to get rid of EVERY last thing that attic... She chalked it up to her being tired and over worked, but looking back, she realized that was just the begriming of years and years of unexplainable stories.

We Tried to Call You!,"Ohio, United States",Psychic / Medium,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Psychic / Medium :: We Tried to Call You!

I have been telling this story for years. It has achieved legendary status in our family because it is supported by no less than five people. This is not necessarily a ghost story, but exhibits some sort of connection between family members.

This story involves my late grandmother on my mother's side, Margaret. She was an amazing woman who excelled in art and enjoying life. She was very gregarious, articulate, loving and open-minded. She believed in a world in which things are not always what they seem. Though I personally put a premium on science, she kept my mind similarly open to the possibility that the world is bigger and more diverse than most people think.

This tale takes place in the early '60s in central Ohio. My family has lived in the region for over 150 years. My grandmother and grandfather lived in Columbus, but had a little summer cottage south of town in a little vacation community called Hide-Away Hills near Chillicothe. The house they maintained there had electricity, but no phone. This was not unusual in rural communities at the time.

One night, my grandparents were there alone. They had gone to bed at a normal time, but my grandmother was tossing and turning most of the night. In her sleep, she kept imploring my grandfather, ""Richard, answer the phone! We have to get the phone! It's ringing, answer the phone!"" My grandfather (Richard), knowing there was no phone in the house down there kept telling her so and trying to get her to stop thrashing about. She told the story as he having said, ""Go to sleep, you old bat, there's no phone here!"" He is a practical and often stoic man, but he loved his wife beyond words, in spite of the ""old bat"" reference. Still, she slept fitfully and murmured throughout the night about a telephone.

In the morning, she told my grandfather about the strange dreams she had that night. She related to him that she had dreamt of a dark room in which a pink coffin was standing upright. In the coffin was her mother. Around the coffin were here four siblings chanting, ""we tried to call you, we tried to call you, we tried to call you..."" He confirmed that she had been wailing about answering a phone, but of course, there was no phone down at Hide-Away, so he was confused and assumed she was having a nightmare.

They soon packed-up and drove the short hour back north to their home in Columbus. Upon arrival, they opened the front door and the phone in the kitchen was ringing. My grandmother went to answer it. On the other end was her sister: ""Margie, Mother died last night. We tried to call you all night, but nobody would pick-up. I'm so sorry, we tried to call you...""

My grandmother's blood did not chill. Based upon the strange occurrences she had throughout her life, she half-expected something like this and was pretty tense the whole ride home. As the family began to deal with the passing of their matriarch, it became clear that as word had spread that night, many of her siblings had tried to contact my grandmother to let her know.

What is this beautiful, strange and mystical connection between family members? Family is my religion.

Will and Testament,"Ohio, United States",Psychic / Medium,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Psychic / Medium :: Will and Testament

T his story takes place in the autumn of 1995 in Columbus, Ohio. My grandmother's sister-in-law, Aunt Margie (also my grandmother's name, coincidentally), had been very sick for some time. She was suffering from a brain tumor that was killing her. I had known she was sick for months and my mother often asked me to visit her in the nursing home to which she had been committed the previous year. I watched her condition worsen for months. She went from struggling with her memory to improperly employing simple diction. ""That's Lazarus (department store),"" she'd exclaim as we drove past, ""they have, um, hamburgers there, very good..."" And, of course, I knew this was incorrect and evidence of her declining health. Eventually, she was totally bed-ridden and was often totally incomprehensible, sometimes babbling and eyes rolling about the room. It was clear she was near death.

My parents are divorced, but they lived near to each other and had joint-custody over my sister and I so that we rotated between houses together, living with each parent for two weeks at a time. One Friday night, I was sleeping at my father's house on the north side of town. In the morning, we transferred down to my mother's house. Upon walking in the front door that morning, I related to my mother a very short, vivid dream I had experienced the night before...

In the dream, I was sitting on the driver's side of a bench seat in an old, orange Buick. Aunt Margie was sitting next to me on the passenger's side. My right hand was resting on the middle portion of the bench between us. Her hand was clasped in mine, but it was wet, clammy and cold. I turned to look at her as she turned her head to look at me. She smiled faintly. That was the end of the dream. I awoke rattled because, though I'm an active dreamer, this one was particularly stark and unsettling because of its simplicity and the almost tactile aspect of her cold, wet hand on mine. It gave me the impression of having touched cold jelly and I can sense it to this day.

So after telling my mother about this dream, she said to me, ""Oh, David, that is too weird because Aunt Margie died last night..."" This in and of itself was not surprising as she had been sick for a long time and we all knew her time was limited. I chalked the dream up to conscious knowledge of the situation and this was just a way that my subconscious was dealing with it. It was coincidence, I thought, that this dream came to me that Friday night.

That is, until Sunday. On Sunday, the elders in the family convened to read her last will and testament. In it, she divided-up her belongs to various members of the family. To me, she left her car. My grandparents knew that she did indeed own a car, but had not driven it in years because she had become portly and was unable to drive herself around easily. For Thanksgiving, for example, I often drove up to her place to pick her up and deliver her to wherever we were having dinner that day. Most people had not seen her drive in years and I, if I ever had, had not seen the car since I was very, very, very young.

My mother came home and told me that Aunt Margie had left me her car in her will. Both my mother and I knew this was pretty uncanny based on the dream, but still didn't think too much of it until we entered her garage that afternoon. As the garage door lifted, I froze in my tracks as, there, almost in mothballs, was an old, dusty, orange Buick from the late '70s or early '80s. I instantly recognized it as the one from my dream. I said to Mom, ""That's the exact car from my dream Friday night..."" Mom said, ""I was afraid you'd say that. Do you want to drive it home, or should I?"" I was reticent to do so because nothing like this had ever happened to me before.

Finally, I saw no harm in it and tried the engine. I put the key in the ignition and turned it. Somehow, the car still worked. There was a little gas in it and I drove it home mulling over the circumstances in my head. When I pulled-up in front of our house, I sat in the car and thought about Aunt Margie. She wasn't even technically a blood relative of mine because she married my grandmother's brother. For some reason, before I got out, I put my left hand down under the driver's seat. There, I extracted a handful of Aunt Margie's hair that must have fallen out due to the chemotherapy she was undergoing. This chilled me and exited the vehicle with haste.

We had trouble starting the car after that and eventually sold it. I related the story to my grandmother who is known for possessing a ""sixth sense"" of sorts. She was convinced that I, too, had a similar gift. After that, my grandmother and I agreed that when she passed, she'd have to stop by and let me know in my dreams. My grandmother, with whom I was VERY close as we were both artists and always had a distinct connection, died unexpectedly about nine years later. Unfortunately, I did not see her in my sleep when she passed, though I dream about her often to this day. I sometimes awake crying, but always hope to dream about her. I miss her terribly and hope I can embrace her again in slumber.

Old Apartment Building,"Ohio, United States",Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: Old Apartment Building

M y story began about 30yrs ago in Cleveland. I was pretty young in the late 70's and didn't know much about ghosts or ghost stories as of yet. My older sisters would see that I became very intimate with such things soon enough. But that's another story.

My family and I lived in an old apartment building during the 70's which was recently labeled as a historical landmark. The building was built in 1897 if I'm not mistaken and was somewhat run down. It was a three story brick building with the atrium being located in the enclosed center of the building. This made it possible for one to see almost any apartment in the building from the center of the atrium. It also had a basement which was split in half. One side for doing laundry, and the other side god knows what. I never did seem to see what was on the other side of the door. There were two main entrances to the building, one in the front, facing the street and the other on the side of the building which also led to the basement. The front entrance had a huge very wide stairway with the railing made of spindles which were spaced just the right size for a hand to reach through and grab a leg. There was also a very dark short hallway which went along side of this staircase as well. My sisters and I would always hate having to go in either entrance after a certain time of the day, it was just very foreboding.

So far there hasn't been too much in my story that was scary, but let me begin by telling you that I still have dreams to this day 30yrs later about things that occurred there. For instance, one day my sisters and some other kids were playing ball on the side of the building leading to the basement. The ball was kicked towards the front of the building in the street and I happened to go after it. While walking towards the street I noticed something out of the corner of my eye coming down from the top of the building and heard a weird sound like someone had poured a pitcher of water onto the cement from the 3rd floor. No sooner do I grab the ball from the street and start walking back do I notice something laying on the sidewalk in the front of the building. From what I can remember after walking towards the object it appeared to be a baby. Not only did it appear to be a baby, but it was the baby that lived upstairs from where I lived. Somehow this child managed to work its way out of the window and onto the sidewalk below. This child was not tall enough in my opinion to work itself up and and over the window sill but none the less here it was laying and dying in front of my eyes.

Another situation that I recall happening was that upstairs in front of the same apartment as the one where the baby fell out of the window, a woman had a heart attack in the hallway and died on the spot. I was pretty young but I do recall seeing the ambulance drivers wheeling a gurney out through the front entrance of the building with a body wrapped in a white sheet.

After these two incidences things seem to heat up in my life. One day I was looking out of the front window of my apartment down at a car with what appeared to be some type of weird face looking up at me from underneath. It was just barely dusk but it seemed as if this face was very humanlike yet the rest of the body was crouched like an animal. I tried to make sounds and scream at it but there was no movement coming from it. I still to this day replay that sight in my mind trying to figure out what I was looking at but haven't a clue.

Another weird situation was one night when we were sitting in the apartment watching the television. My parents used to keep it dark because we had little money and electricity wasn't that cheap. Well we were all sitting there and all of a sudden we notice there was a black cat in the room where we were watching tv. We didn't own any pets so the cat didn't belong to us. This cat found its way into our apartment scaring the heck out of all of us.

There were many more weird things like noises throughout the apartment at night and things being misplaced. The worst thing is the recurring dreams I still have about something watching me as I walk through the hallways but never being able see what exactly is watching me.

Ghost Attack,"Michigan, United States",Old Hags / Night Attacks / Sleep Paralysis,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Old Hags / Night Attacks / Sleep Paralysis :: Ghost Attack

F irst I'll start out by telling what I believe ghosts are. I believe that they aren't spirits who are trapped between dimensions, or have some unfinished business. I think that once a person dies, they either go to Heaven, or to Hell. And when they're in Hell, I think it's possible Satan sends spirits back to Earth for one reason or another, whether it's just to frighten us, or harm us, or just to make us question our faith. So, now that that's out of the way, here's my story.

One night, I was sleeping just fine, but all of a sudden I snapped awake. I didn't move for a second, wondering why I was awake, and wondering what time it was. So I rolled over to see what time it was. As I did that, for a split second I saw a large white thing, not really any particular shape. It was there for not even a full second and then it moved out of my field of vision.

Now, before this, there had been other less important encounters, which I've told my mom about. My mom had always told me that in the Bible it tells us that Satan and demons can't read minds, so you have to actually say something to get them to leave, like ""God protect me"", so as soon as I saw the thing, I tried to say that, but as I opened my mouth, I felt my whole body become paralyzed.

It was like something had grabbed me by the neck and my body went numb. It felt like that feeling you get when your foot is asleep for so long it starts to hurt, except for me, it was all across my body, and I wasn't able to move.

So I tried to say something, but I could only hear myself gasping as I tried to say it. I tried again and got the same result, but the third time, I was able to say ""God protect me"" and it let go. My whole body felt relieved and I could move again. I turned on my light and just sat there praying for half an hour, and (in my opinion) God granted me protection and comfort, so I felt relieved, and was able to go back to sleep with no further encounters that night.

In case anyone was wondering, the time was around 3AM. I can't remember the day or month, but it was this year (2007), and no more than 5 months ago. We are the first people to live in this house, and it was constructed 7 years ago. There had been less significant encounters before this happened.

But, unfortunately, it didn't stop there. Last week, on Nov. 10, if I remember correctly, I had an encounter with what I believe was the same ghost. I was in my basement, which is set up so that when you're watching TV, you're facing away from the wall that separates the living room, and the workout room.

As I was watching a movie, I glanced into the glass front of the cabinet next to the TV. It reflects the end of the wall separating the living room from the workout room. When I looked, I saw a white thing retreat behind that wall. (Thing is the only way I can describe it. I wasn't able to see it long enough to get an idea of what shape it was.)

Again, I said ""God protect me"" and stood up and started upstairs. I looked back and in the middle of the living room, I could see something standing. Well, not see it, because it was clear, but it was almost like fog or steam. Like the air was distorted, but it was (more or less) in the shape of a person.

So I hurried upstairs and told my mom and she felt freaked out too when she heard it from me. She actually got mad and said ""I'm going to go give it a piece of my mind! I'm mad"", so she went downstairs and yelled ""get out of our house!"" and she found that the door was open about 2 inches, and it was closed when I was down there.

I've been wondering why a ghost would be in our house, and why it would be bothering me specifically. I also would just like to hear any comments anyone has on the story. Thanks!

The Girl Who Couldn't Figure Out How to Get to Heaven  2,"North Carolina, United States",Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: The Girl Who Couldn't Figure Out How to Get to Heaven  2

I was very pleased when I found out that my previous story was published . It helps to know that there are other people that have experienced the same thing that I have. I have often wondered over the years why Eliese appeared to me, what was her purpose? I have also found out that she hasn't only made her presence known to me, but to my great grand mother, my grandmother, my mother and my brother as well.

My great grand mother gives this accounting. She was about nine years old when she saw Eliese. It was a cool, fall evening, the leaves were rustling above her head as she sat beneath a old, red, maple tree and was playing with her marbles. Suddenly she heard laughing and looked up to see the figure of a little blond girl running down the dirt road toward the old tobacco barn which was out in the woods. Great grandma said that she was lonely and hoped that the little girl would play with her, so she took off running after her and when she approached the edge of the woods, the girl disappeared. Great grandma told nobody about what she had seen.

My grand mother said that Eliese has been haunting the home place and the grounds surrounding it for as long as she can remember. She said that she feels her presence the strongest on the third floor of the house which is where the children's rooms were located. My grand mother also said that they found the field hand that murdered Eliese and hung him from a oak tree, down the road from the home place. She said that he haunts the property as well. I asked her how she knew this and she said that she was taking a load of laundry down the stairs when something pushed her from behind, she said that the presence was that of a man and that he was very angry.

My brother also said that he saw the figure of a man walking down the hallway and vanishing just before it got to the back door of the house. He was so shaken up about it that he mentioned it to know one, until I told him about my seeing the girl. He also said that to him, it seems that the little girl is lost, and that it sounds to him like she is crying, instead of laughing.

My mother had a encounter with her as well, when she was about seven or eight. It gets very cold in the winter time, up on the third floor it's hard for the heat to reach that high. My mother said that she was sleeping and suddenly she woke up. She saw the girl standing by the bed and she appeared to be warning my mother to cover herself back up with the quilts, my mother did it and then the girl disappeared.

Eliese is not at rest, she had her life snuffed out at such a young age by a terrible man who is not at rest either, and both of them still haunt the home place to this day.

A Visit to Grandpa,"Tennessee, United States",Poltergeists / Physical Manifestations,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Poltergeists / Physical Manifestations :: A Visit to Grandpa

T his happened a long time ago in Prudential Hollow, I was about four years old. My mother and I were at grandpa's house, we had spent the biggest part of the day there and it was getting late in the evening. Rather than walk the mile or so home in the dark, it was decided that we spend the night and go home the next day.

Grandpa's house, like every house in Prudential was old, very old. It was an old mining house which had been added to over the years. It consisted of three rooms and two porches. The first two rooms were side by side, the same length with doors leading to the front porch. The room on the right was the living room and Grandpa had his bed in there. The room on the left was fixed up as a bedroom, with the door leading to the front porch closed off and the only other door being the one that opened into the living room. Both rooms had fireplaces in them. The third room sat at the back of the house with a door opening off the living room. This room was used as a kitchen/dining room with a small porch opening off the back.

Now that you know the layout of the house, on with the story. As I mentioned, Grandpa slept in the living room, He said he could not sleep in the bedroom, something bothered him in there. Now, my Mother had (to put it delicately) a big mouth and constantly used it. She made the brag that she could sleep in there and nothing could stop her (thanks a lot Mom}.

Come bedtime and we all settled in, Grandpa and Ma in their bed in the living room and my Mother and I in the bedroom. All went well for about fifteen or twenty minutes and then all hell broke loose. The bed started shaking and the metal bedstead banging against the wall, as if this wasn't enough, there was a moaning or groaning and the bed started jumping up and down off the floor. As you can imagine by this time my mother was screaming like a banshee and yours truly was along for the ride. Grandpa came running, dressed in his long johns and hollered for her to pitch me to him and then jump and run, Grandpa caught me and she jumped and we ran to the living room shutting the bedroom door behind us.

After awhile it calmed down and mom and I spent the rest of the night on a pallet on the floor next to Grandpa's bed. We never did spend the night there again. My father later stated that he would not have spent the night in that house for a hundred dollars as bad as he needed the money.

This wasn't the only thing that happened at this place, it was just the only one I was involved in. Some things happened that Grandpa would talk about and some things he wouldn't. I may talk to my older brother and see if he remembers the stories. If he does I'll write a part II.

I will close by saying I do remember that there was a certain patch of ground that nothing would grow in no matter how you tried to get things to grow it would stay bare.

A Visit from Arnie,"Nebraska, United States",Family / Friends Visits,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Family / Friends Visits :: A Visit from Arnie

A s I left the office, the only thing I could think about was getting out of my suit and heels and into some sweats and tennis shoes. I was looking forward to relaxing as it had been a very long day and the end of the week was near, the weekend holding a promise of maybe some relaxation and rest.

I turned on the radio in my truck to relax on my way home. As I merged into to traffic on I-480 south bound, I found that the traffic had soon come to a crawl. I turned stations on my radio to see if there may be a traffic report to explain the congestion. A news report came on shortly explaining a horrific accident that had occurred on the I-480 north bound side that was causing many problems for traffic proceeding in both directions. I decided that I really did not want to deal with the traffic mess and would exit at the first chance and take the side streets home. I tuned back onto my music, as I approached the next exit near Creighton Medical College, I could see the wreckage on the off ramp. It was horrible! The red car had folded like an accordion upon hitting the tree. There, of course, were medical crews on scene and they appeared to be administering CPR to the poor individual extracted from the car. I said a silent prayer for God's will and proceeded off the exit ramp.

I decided to stop at a convenience type food mart to grab milk and bread, hopefully keeping me from having to go out later in the evening. I made my way through the store looking for the items I needed, as I rounded the corner, my cousin Arnie approached from the other side. I was so excited to see him! It had been months since we had seen each other. I knew he had recently taken on a second job to make ends meet (times are tough all over and a dollar doesn't seem to stretch as it used to) but he looked terribly exhausted. ""Arnie!"" I exclaimed, ""I am so glad to see you!"" He stared blankly at me for a few moments then greeted me with a hug and a ""how are you"". I told him I was well and asked how he was doing. ""I am --- okay. I am so tired, so tired. I want to go home"". I asked him if he needed my help. He said no, he had a fare he was picking up at Creighton, he was driving a taxi as his second job. It was important to finish the job and pick up the fare.

He looked so tired and had such a blank expression that I became concerned. I told him I would call his dispatch and tell them he was ill, I could drive him home to rest and they could send someone after the taxi. He said no, he had to pick up his fare, He then kept repeating, at least three or four times, that he just wanted to go home, do his job and go home. Arnie had three wonderful children that he loved more than life itself and I was assuming his was missing his children, but he just looked ill. I told him that we needed to keep in touch and that I missed seeing him. He turned and walked away towards the check out stand and looked back over his shoulder. As he walked away, over his shoulder, he said 'love ya'. His words were slow and halting and he was walking very slowly. My concern maintained. I felt he was ill and needed to rest.

I grabbed the couple of items I needed from the store and proceeded to the check out. I figured I could catch up to Arnie and maybe persuade him to take me up on my offer to take him home. He should not be driving, let alone picking up taxi fares, feeling that poorly. As I approached the check stand, Arnie was no where in sight. I asked the clerk if she saw which direction Arnie had gone. She asked what he looked like, I described him, and Arnie was hard to miss. He was about 6'3"", 250 pounds with shoulder length blonde hair and piercing blue eyes. The clerk replied she had not seen anyone fitting that description. There was only one check out register, so... I chalked it up to her having seen so many people all day that she had forgotten. I looked into the parking area quickly to see if I could pick him out in the lot anywhere. He was no where to be seen. I made my purchases and continued home. I figured I would call Arnie later and see how he was feeling.

As I continued my drive home, the radio mentioned the accident again and stated the interstate was still backed up due to the accident. I got home, changed clothes and sat down to relax. My husband asked if I would like to go to dinner at one of those family style restaurants, neither of us wanting to cook. We got back into the truck, the radio announced the accident was still being cleaned up. We took the side streets. As we ordered our dinner, I began to get a terrible headache. A few minutes later I became very nauseated. I thought perhaps I was suddenly coming down with something.

Our dinner was served and I asked for a box. With the way I had started to feel, I would not be able to eat a thing. A few minutes later my cell phone rang. It was my Aunt, Arnie's mother. She informed me that Arnie had just passed on. He was in a horrible car accident driving his taxi. She went on to explain that it was the very accident that had been on the radio and had blocked traffic earlier in the evening. I was stunned! The accident occurred at around 4:15 PM. They had a terrible time extricating him from the wreckage. He passed at Creighton Medical Center at 6:30 PM.

I was absolutely numb! I had just seen and visited with Arnie at the food mart at 5:30! How? Why? I am still numb and confused. This incident occurred 2 days ago, and as I grieve for Arnie and for my families loss I also continue to wonder and feel confused and actually a bit frightened.

Why do these things keep happening to me? What shall I do about this?

A Mysterious Stranger,"California, United States",Apparitions / Voices / Touches,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Apparitions / Voices / Touches :: A Mysterious Stranger

B ack when I was younger (I was around 14 years old) I was living in my old house in Shafter, CA. It's a small town, with some haunted places (the Green Hotel, for one). Now, I was never a doubter in the supernatural, but I was never a believer. My room was separated from the living room by a tiny... Hallway isn't the right word. It was like a little intersection that fanned to the bathroom, living room, my room, and my parent's room. I used to share a bunk with my younger brother (he was 10 at the time).

Before this, I never had any kind of supernatural or otherworldly experience. I was sleeping soundly, when all of a sudden I woke up. It was Tuesday night, my dad was away at work for the week, and I could hear my mother and brother snoring. They are both overweight, so I was surprised when I turned around (my back was facing the ""hallway"" and saw a lady in a gray dress. She was skinny, wearing a gray dress. The light in the living room (I assume it was that, or she was radiating herself) was on, and I could faintly through the dress, much like her silhouette in the dress fabric. She just stood there, and her face, while dark, had a sharp, angular beauty to it. I hid under the sheets, and went back to sleep. The next night, I again woke up at the same time (which was 12:37, I know because this happened for many nights) and saw her again. I told no one, and eventually I just stopped seeing her. Every night was the same though - I awake with my back towards the ""hallway"" and turn around to see her for a few minutes before I go back to sleep.

Dirty Secret,"California, United States",Apparitions / Voices / Touches,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Apparitions / Voices / Touches :: Dirty Secret

T his happened mid-October 2007. I enjoy walking down Alhambra Boulevard, mostly prompted out of fitness and because I love Autumn! The cool nights reacting with chlorophyll change the leaves to every shade of red and yellow you can imagine. It was twilight and the schoolyard seemed empty. The evening chill seemed to chase away nearly everyone, leaving just a smattering of cars, me and the susurrus of trees.

Then something caught my eye. Standing by on old oak on the west corner of the playground I saw what looked like a stock-still person staring at me. This would not be too surprising, the homeless abound in downtown. As I strolled closer the figure failed to fill in, but I am a little near sighted. This was most obviously a woman, she had bowed shoulders and large hips. Then within just steps the figure, just as I was getting ready to say, ""Hello"", it disintegrated into nothing.

When I got right next to the tree I couldn't find any thing that might have caused an optical illusion. This simply was not a shadow thrown by light/twilight, or anything tangible. When I got home I decided to investigate. I would not have taken the time to look into the history of this place if it was explainable, or if I had a hunch that it was. I was surprised to learn how my eerie encounter seems to correlate with the disturbing history of the site.

Where Sutter Middle School now sits, the bodies of 4,685 people were exhumed. The dead were transported in the 1950's to their new home at East lawn cemetery, across town, but this begs the question, ""Did they get everyone?""

Over a hundred years ago when John Sutter, the founder of Sacramento, was alive, he donated that area as a permanent graveyard eventually called the New Helvetia. In the early days, of the New Helvetia Cemetery, many interred bodies were signified by a wooden cross only. I wonder, do we know the names on those wooden crosses? I bet the records have been lost for many and their crosses have long ago dissolved into grave dirt, leaving some dead anonymous, and unaccounted for, bodies behind.

Just pouring a playground over the cemetery may have been enough to wake the forgotten dead. I would be upset to! What was intended to be a final resting place became a casualty in the unsentimental march of progress.

Dreams of my Granny,United Kingdom,Family / Friends Visits,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Family / Friends Visits :: Dreams of my Granny

N ot sure how to start this story as I'm sure it'll be quite long but here goes. It is mainly about my great-grandmother so I guess I'll give you some background information about her. Basically my Great-Granny Sadie died a while back when I was about 15 (so approx 6 years ago). She was a lovely woman. She loved playing with dolls even as an old lady. If she visited us she would ask me to bring out my barbies. She just loved changing their clothes and brushing their hair. I wasn't especially close to her but we had that shared love of dolls. She used to always say that she loved all her Great-Grandchildren but she particularly liked me because I was a very smiley, happy child.

About a year after she died, it dawned on me that I'd never visited her grave (She had requested before she died that only the men in the family go to her graveside for her burial, as she didn't want the woman crying over her grave). Me and my sister decided after school one day that we'd get some flowers and go to her grave. We spent ages wondering around the graveyard just looking at headstones etc. It was quite sad yet I found it interesting reading the headstones. Eventually when we found her grave, we laid down our flowers and stood there for a little while.

That night I had a dream that my Granny Sadie was standing in my room, she was surrounded by bright light and she was thanking me for bringing her the flowers. I woke up fully remembering this vivid dream. I thought it was nice but largely down to the fact that I had visited her grave that day, so had probably been thinking about her a little. Just to clarify for readers -this memory was just like that of a dream, I did not feel that I was awake at all or had physically seen her in my room. So overall I thought it was nice to think that she was watching out for me, but that it was likely just a dream because she had been on my mind.

That, I'm sure is a fairly average experience, but there is more to this story that made me think Granny Sadie genuinely is keeping an eye out for me. A good year later just before Christmas, my family were going through a rough patch. My dad has suffered with severe manic depression throughout my entire live, which has affected my life greatly. Regularly my parents would fall out due to my dad's violent mood swings and although I love him, I am still now a little scared of his temper. It was a few days before Christmas and things got pretty bad to the point were my mum, brother, sister and I all grabbed a few things and left the house. I won't bore you with all the details but basically this was the worst point of my life to date. And I am still plagued by a strong guilt for 'abandoning my dad'. My dad was eventually found in our house having over-dosed on painkillers and anti-depressants and was taken into hospital to have his stomach pumped and put in a psychiatric ward. At this point, with dad in hospital, we returned home. It was Christmas eve and our house had pills everywhere. In every room, just scattered around. The Christmas tree was in the bin and all the presents had been ripped open. We were all very shaken by the events of the previous few days but after clearing up, we were all so emotionally tired that we went to bed.

I woke up late that night because the phone was ringing. I instinctively just thought 'that's my dad' and I thought 'okay I have to answer it', I didn't want my Mum, brother or sister to be any more stressed than they already were. When I answered the phone it was my dad, he was crying and telling me how he'd tried to kill himself because we had left him. I talked to him for a while -calmed him down and told him that we still loved him but it would take time and he needed help. Calmed down, he hung-up and I went back to bed as I was so exhausted due to the stress of everything. That night I had another dream of my Granny Sadie. All I could see was her face and she was surrounded by bright light directly above me, all she said was 'tell your mum everything will be okay'.

I didn't remember the next day until dinner time, it was Christmas day and we were at my aunts having dinner and when I remembered I told my mother straight away and she burst into tears. I asked her if she believed me, and she said she did (my granny had dreams like that from time to time). This time I didn't think it was a coincidence. As much as I cared for my Granny, I didn't think of her *that* often, especially not at such an emotional time when I had other things on my mind. I genuinely now believe she is watching over me as she felt she had a connection with me when I was younger and it's very comforting to feel that. As for my parents, well they still have their ups and downs but everything IS okay.

Sorry if I waffled on too much, I know this isn't strictly a 'ghost story'. I feel very emotional thinking about this time and the visit from my Granny doesn't seem like such a big deal without hearing what my family was going through at the time. Thanks for reading.

My Gift,Ireland,Psychic / Medium,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Psychic / Medium :: My Gift

F irstly, I want to let everyone know that when these happen, I was not imagining. And I'm not bluffing. It started a couple of years ago after my Grandfather's house was burned down. Strange images kept coming into my head when I awoke, or walking around my house, or when I had nothing to do. I kept seeing things that would happen in a week or later in a month. It's all strange. And I'm trying my best to explain it.

One time, as I was reading a book of Harry Potter, I saw Two Towers of a city exploding, and I kept hearing screams. It wasn't my imagination on the book, it was something happening in my head. It scared me. Later, in 2001, these Two Towers I saw exploding, and falling down by two air plains on the news. The same thing I saw in my head a year before it happened.

Another: I walked out to get my mail late in the evening as I came from college to home, as I opened the mail-box, I had a sensation that I would soon hear ghostly music coming from inside my house. And I did, as I walked up to the door to go inside. But before I went inside, I heard someone say my name. A male voice, sounding far and distant. I felt a cold spot right behind me! I ran, I ran for life to get inside the house.

My Aunt Mary told me once, that my mom told her when they where young, that my mom had the same things happen to her. She said it was because of psychic phenomenon. And having a gift to visit with ghosts. That scared me. I didn't want to have any connection with ghosts. But what can I do? How can I get rid of it?

After my Aunt Mary told me this, I was visited by a ghost, a little boy. He told me that he killed himself in a school that was now closed down. He was my friend. No one else saw or could hear him, except me. He said he trusted me and wants me to help him with something, knowing that I had a special gift. He hasn't told me yet what he wants help with, yet. Something that happened in his past.

Has anyone had these strange things happen to them? It's all new to me. And I don't understand. I'll let you know soon of what the boy wants help with and how we did it. But it hasn't happened yet.

Does anybody know what I'm going through? Have you had the same similar thing happen? It's just strange...

The Costume Maker,"California, United States",Psychic / Medium,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Psychic / Medium :: The Costume Maker

G rowing up I moved a lot, my dad was in the Navy and 3 years was the longest we stayed in one spot. When I was 3, we moved to Monterey, Ca. Let me tell you, lots of strange things happened there all of which I remember like it was yesterday... Maybe I'll post some of those experiences later. This experience is something that I personally don't remember, but has been told to me by every member of my immediate family word for word, for years. My parents were there along with my biological sister; who is 10 1/2 years older than me; and my biological brother; who is 9 1/2 years older than me.

One day when I was about 4 years old, I was being an absolute brat, I was running around disobeying my parents and throwing fits, so my mom decided to put me in the corner. At first I whined and cried but eventually she got me to obey, and as soon as I did I fell asleep. Yes, standing with my nose against the corner I just conked out! Everyone just figured that I was being a brat because of how tired I was.

Within minutes of falling asleep, though, I woke up, turned around and told everyone I needed a bath. Well, at this point in life I hated bathing, so it took everyone by surprise that I wanted to take one. My mom told me ""Joelle, turn around, you're in time out!"" I told her I needed to take a bath and get ready for work. My mom again told me, ""Joelle, stop messing around you're in time out. Turn around or you'll be in more trouble!"" I asked her why she kept calling me 'Joelle' (Joelle IS my real name) that's not my name and I need to get ready for work. So my mom asked me where I worked and I told her that ""I make costumes for little people."" When I said this a chill ran down my mom's spine.

I fought with her for another few minutes before my mom got me to face the corner, at which point I fell asleep again. When I woke up a few minutes later and was allowed to leave time out my family asked me why I had done that. I had no idea what they were talking about; I didn't remember any of it.

The really weird part is that at 4 I couldn't talk very well, but everyone says I spoke very clearly and in an older females voice.

Being Touched,"Illinois, United States",Old Hags / Night Attacks / Sleep Paralysis,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Old Hags / Night Attacks / Sleep Paralysis :: Being Touched

T his one happened to my Mom and Aunt when I was a little girl. I read a story that someone put in the web site and after I read it, it reminded me of this one. Only difference is that this one would be more in the lines of being believable.

I was about 6 or 7 years old and we live in an apartment at the time. My parents had been looking to buy a home but for the time being, we were living there. This was in Chicago, IL on Whipple street. It was a basement apt and as you walked through the door there was a room, which I guess you can say it was like a foyer, then you would turn to your right and there was another room which was the living room and the dinning room, if you would walk towards the end of the apt, to your left was my parents room and a small hallway to the right, at the end of the hallway to the right was a bathroom and to the left the kitchen and at the end of the kitchen there was my brother's and my bedroom. At the time there was just two of us.

So, many things happened in this apartment that I truly would like to find out what ever happened in that apartment or basement. I will tell you all about it at its time. Between the kitchen and my parents room, there was a small hallway which was like a walk in closet, but it would lead to the kitchen and our bedroom. One night we were all sleeping and my mom said that she had this uneasy feeling, as if someone was watching her. She said she had her eyes closed and it had gotten cold. She slept on the inside of the bed against the wall. She said that she would cover herself and something uncovered her. She thought it had been my Dad. So she covered up again, and again she was uncovered, but this time she felt someone touch her, almost as if they were caressing her. She turned to see if it was my Dad and she could see that my dad was turned to the other side. She tried to reach for my dad to wake him up but she was frozen, she could not move. She said that she could not see anyone but she could feel the breathing in her face and they were grabbing her.

After about 5 minute of trying to break free, she finally did and was able to wake my dad up, but he did not know what to do to help her, all he did was just stay with her until she fell back to sleep.

The next day she called my Aunt and told her what had happened. My Aunt was quiet on the other side of the line. My mom asked her if she was okay and she said to her ""the exact same thing happened to me"" and my mom asked her when, and she said ""last night"". When they confirmed the time it was around the same time that they both experienced it. My mom and my Aunt are not twins and she lived at the time in Chicago and my Aunt in Costa Rica Central America.

So, how do you explain two people experiencing the same thing at the same time only different places.

The Ghosts of 1011 Lansdown,Canada,Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: The Ghosts of 1011 Lansdown

W hen I turned 18, I packed my bags, kissed mom good bye, and headed for the biggest adventure of my life, Toronto! I was very excited, coming from saskatchewan, and was ready for all the glitz and glamour of the big city. I unfortunately ended up living at 1011 Lansdown, and it had a horrible reputation and was by far the worst, ugliest and most awful building I had ever lived in, but the rent was cheap and I fixed up my bachelor pad real nice, and set in to trying to make my way in the big city.

I had lived there for about 8 months, when a friday the 13th started to come around. All month long I had an uneasy feeling, and for 2 weeks straight I would be sitting on my futon in my little square room, and I would see a dark shadow come down the door, along the south wall and circle the room, ending up in the bathroom, where it would seem to settle in the bath tub. Then I would see a kind of form sit up in the bathtub, to say the least this freaked me out and chalked it down to the girl I had staying with me at the time who claimed to have been raised by cult members who practiced voodoo. I simply thought she had brought an evil presence with her and asked her to leave (which wasn't easy, she was a real mean gal, that one) eventually she left and I cleansed my apt with some fresh sage from the railway tracks behind the house. Thinking this would resolve the problem. It didn't.

Now all month long, I had been joking with people in the building, ""just watch"" I would say ""on the 13th, they will find a body on the building"". I got in a fight with my boyfriend on the 11th, and went to stay with a friend, and returned on the 13th.

When I got to the building, there were police cars and a coroners van there, needless to say I was kind of shocked, the cleaning lady told me a body had been found on the 15th floor, right above my suite (I lived on 14), she told me the body had been there some time, about 2 weeks! I laughed it off and said right sure! I went up to my floor and unlocked my door, the hallway light wasn't working and so I walked down the hall, I kept hearing crunch crunch with every step I took. ""My cats sure made a mess with their littler"" I thought, the light in the kitchen bedroom wasn't working either. Crunch crunch, I went into the bathroom and turned on the light, and was standing there wondering what all this white stuff was everywhere, when I realized it was moving! Maggots! Everywhere! I grabbed my cats, and ran out locking the door behind me. I left everything there and never went back. To this day when I walk on 15 and 14 floor I get chills. To imagine what I saw those two weeks was probably the spirit of the person upstairs, who had been found in the bathroom!

Another time, last winter in fact, I was visiting krissy, a friend of mine on the 8th floor, her floor is quiet most of the time but there is a girl there who brings lots of strangers by and would often have them waiting in the hallway, needless to say I wasn't surprised to see a man in black at the end of the hall when leaving krissy's. But my hair was standing on end and I got a horrible feeling of dread, I asked krissy to come out into the hall, and we called to the guy who was leaning against the far door, ""hey, who you waiting for?"" he didn't move at all, and although it seemed he was facing us, we could only see black, we then noticed it was not a solid kind of person, it was like a solid black fog in the shape of a person. We kept calling him asking who he was and telling him to get lost, he didn't move, didn't move at all, not shift his head to look our way, nothing. This whole time we started to get an even heavier feeling of foreboding and evil, krissy sensed it to.

Determined not to be scared I started walking toward the elevators, hallway between us and it. I couldn't even get to them, it's as if something was stopping me from going any farther, and the feeling got worse, I started to back away quickly down the hall, never taking my eyes off it, and decided to take the stairs, the lights were off all the way down to the 6 th floor and I ran for my life blindly in the dark heart ready to jump out of my chest, and took the lift from 6 down. My skin was still crawling as I left the building and went to the coffee shop. I hopped in the truck and called krissy on the cell, "" who or what was that"" I asked and we both said at the same time ""I think it was a demon!""

Many other things have happened at 1011 lansdown, but by far these two things were the worst, some nights though that same feeling, like foreboding and a great evil on the loose would settle over the building and on those nights, I would stay far far away, or hole up in krissy's until the vibe had cleared and was more or less back to normal. I am so glad I don't live there anymore!

T his one would happen to me as a child in the same house where I told the story of my mom being touched while she was sleeping. I experienced a lot of things in this apartment as a child and my family members would too.

I would wake up in the middle of the night when I was about 6 or 7 years old and would not be able to go back to sleep. I would go into my parents' bedroom and try to sleep there, but would not be able to either.

In my parents room there was like a walway in the shape of an arch that would lead to the living room. I would start to see in front of me people talking to each other and at times they were yelling at each other. I remember thinking, these people must be old and they dress funny. I would see them every night. As I got older I realized that these were ghosts and they were wearing wigs and dresses like in the Louis XV of France era. I don't remember being very afraid, just startled at the fact that there was strange people in the house as everyone slept.

Then just like that, I never saw them again. Then again we moved to the house my parents bought, but I still remember them as if it was yesterday.

One other time I was helping my mom vacuum the apartment and when I would turn the vacuum on, you could hear a lot of people screaming and cursing and when you would turn it off they were gone. One day I told my mom about it and she stood there while I turned it on and she heard them as well, she was so angry because it was happening in my brother's and my bed room and she said out loud and in a angry voice tone ""go away and leave us alone"" and they stopped. At least for that day.

One day while we were out when we got back home, we saw that water was coming out of the apt under the door and when my dad opened the door a bunch of water came gushing out some pipe had supposedly been broken and caused the flood. The funny thing was that the pipe was never found.

Things would disappear from our house and no one but us had been in the house. My mom ended up getting pregnant with my brother, the youngest and last, and when he was born I heard her tell my dad that while she was in the house sleeping with my brother, she saw 3 little men, almost like elves, walking towards my brother's crib and they climbed up and were playing with the baby mobile. When she got up to look she just saw the toys moving by themselves.

We ended up moving from that place when my parents found the house we were looking for, but weird things did happen there. I tend to forget a few but when they come to me I will write them down to share them with all of you.

Floating Lamp,"Idaho, United States",Poltergeists / Physical Manifestations,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Poltergeists / Physical Manifestations :: Floating Lamp

T here have been a few accounts in my parents' house but this one seems to stands out the most. It was right after Christmas 2002 and my mom, my oldest sister and me were sitting in the living room just talking, when on the table next to the couch my mom and I were sitting, the lamp started to shake and before we knew it, it lifted over the baby wipes and my sister's wallet and set itself on the floor about three feet away from the couch.

I know it didn't fall cause I watched it literally float over the wallet and baby wipes. This lamp weighs about thirty pounds and is quite bulky. We tried to blow it off but how can you blow off something like that?

We have had other things happen like sometimes when I am in my mom's bedroom taking a nap, I can smell a rose-like perfume and something has literally shaken my shoulder, called my name and told me to wake up. It's not scary, in some way it is comforting. My mom has smelled this same smell and something has told her to wake up or will just call her name.

We moved into to this house about ten years ago and have had many things happen.

Some things quit happening after I became a christian but stuff like the rose perfume and sometimes the feeling someone is watching is still there.

Scary Retirement Homes,"Virginia, United States",Misc,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Misc :: Scary Retirement Homes

I work at a retirement home and I like it, but there are just so many people talking about how they have had ghostly encounters. I always said, if I don't see it I don't believe it. Yesterday I was at work with my friend Jessica and co-worker Diane, I was washing dishes and jess was making coffee, when all of a sudden a cup that was on a shelf comes tumbling down and hits the floor. Jessica and Diane both look at me and we start to freak out because no one else is in the room with us.

Later that evening we were getting ready to push the food cart out to the hallway but then I notice that somebody already moved it so I asked Jessica and Diane if they moved it and they told me no, so that really freaked me out, then all of a sudden we started to get cool chills and it got really cold. When we were just about finished, Jessica has to take the dirty linens down the hall to this dark and dreary laundry room, she went down there and the hairs on her back began to stand up. So Jessica ran back to the kitchen telling us about it.

We all were really getting scared and things were just getting a little spooky for me... If anything else happens I will write back and tell you... Thanks for reading!

The Unseen Visitor,"Tennessee, United States",Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: The Unseen Visitor

I t was in the late seventies and I was living and working in Knoxville. I had a few days off, so I came home to visit Momma. I had been there about all day and had planned on spending the night and going back to Knoxville sometime the next day. Since I was spending the night, my sister and her husband decided to go out for a while leaving just me and Momma by ourselves.

We were sitting in the living room talking about one thing and another when we heard a loud rap on the front door. I had started to get up to go answer the door when the door flew open, I looked over at Mom all big eyed and started to say something. She put her finger to her lips, you know the be quiet sign.

As we sat there, we could hear footfalls coming across the living room floor. When the footfalls stopped you could see the sofa cushion depress like someone sitting down. Let me tell you brother, by this time I was getting scared, I wasn't nearly as brave back then as I am now. I was fixing to get out of there when Momma spoke.

She said, ""If you have anything to tell us, tell it. If not, I would appreciate it if you would leave because you are scaring my boy"". Immediately we saw the sofa cushion rise back to normal and footfalls crossing the floor to the front door. The door then slammed shut.

After I regained my composure I asked Momma what had just happened. Mommas are supposed to know everything but she said she didn't know. She did say she thought something had happened there in the past, she just didn't know what.

To make a long story short, when my Sister and Brother in Law got back, I went back to Knoxville. I knew that if I stayed the night that I would have to sleep on the sofa, no way was I doing that.

Many more things have happened here, maybe I will write about them in the future.

Something by the Dock on Canada Day,Canada,Misc,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Misc :: Something by the Dock on Canada Day

O ver the summer, my cousin Louise and her father, my cousin Jack and his father, and me and my father went on a fishing trip to Canada. It was Canada Day while we were there, which is july 1st. There were a lot of fireworks and we all decided to go onto our dock and watch. This particular night was very clear and cold.

The fireworks were having the grand finale when all of us thought we heard something on the other dock. It sounded as if someone had just cast their line into the water. Of course, all the dads acted as if they never heard anything, but we knew they did because when it happened everyone went silent to see what it was. All of the kids got together and asked each other if we had heard the splash. We all heard it! Then all of a sudden a fish started splashing franticly. It was at the top of the surface and moving towards the opposite dock! Very much like someone was pulling it in! Along with the fish splashing, there was a sort of cranking noise. We looked over to the opposite dock and there was no one there! We were stunned!

The dads started yelling over trying to see if someone was actually there we couldn't see. There was no answer. We all hurried of the dock and ran back to the cabin. After everyone had settled down a bit, we decided to go to the main house. The house was far away up a hill. We were all really scared to go up there, but we had to tell them something. We all started our journey to the main house. We were practically running because we were so scared. We just kept our eyes in front of us hoping there would be nothing like what we heard on the dock.

When we got to the main house, we told them about what we had heard on the dock. They said that people had told them that they heard similar things. Then Tinker, the owner of where we were staying, said he had heard the same thing himself. Most of the time people told them about what they had heard was on July 1st, around the same time of day.

My Weird Story,"North Carolina, United States",Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: My Weird Story

Y ou think what you've read is weird? Well, you probably haven't yet. I grew up (and still live) in a house built in the 1870s. The house was built by a tobacco baron that owned a few hundred acres, but the land has mostly been developed in to housing. The house sits on only about 10 acres now. It's nice, and big with five bedrooms, each bedroom has a bathroom and a good closet. There's also a living room, dinning room, office, kitchen, study, bonus room, basement and attic. There's also an old barn on the property that's been fixed up and turned in to a nice garage and a few sheds that we use to store tools. All the buildings date back as old as the house.

It was always a little odd to say the least. There's always been noises that were unexplainable, drafts in rooms that didn't have windows and all sorts of unexplainable crap and occurrences.

One day, my brothers and I were out in the woods, walking towards the place where we built this fort, and all of a sudden I had a thought that said ""RUN"". All three of us started running back towards the house as fast as we could, and couldn't explain why. When we started talking about it, we all had that same thought. It took me weeks to get the courage to go back in that area. We ended up building a new fort elsewhere, but sometimes I would hear what sounded like feet walking behind me.

A few months later, I watched a dictionary slide across a shelf and place itself perfectly in the spot where it normally sits.

I woke up one night to see a lady in a green dress or robe smiling at me. She kissed me on the head and disappeared. I actually wake up and see her from time to time and she always looks back at me and smiles. My sister said she's seen the lady to.

In the bathroom once, I saw this strange white mist that simply disappeared within moments of catching my eyes.

Once I felt what felt like hands around my throat. I've heard what sounded like a ladies laugh, unexplainable voices when I was alone. The list goes on and on, but I never felt threatened by them so I brushed them off.

After my sister turned fourteen, we started to see ""it"". It looked like the cloaked predator from that Arnold Schwarzenegger  movie. In case you've never seen the movie, the predator, when he cloaked, looked like a humanoid that was translucent. You could only ever see his outline when he was cloaked.

My sister suffers from depression and we shared a room because we didn't want to leave her alone. She would cut her wrist, so we were always afraid that she would cut her wrist at night and we wouldn't know. That also meant we had to share a bathroom (which is another story all together). Me and her are also best friends, and that probably came from sharing a room together.

The first time we saw it, me and her were home alone. I heard her scream and used the key I had to get in to the bathroom because I felt like she was in trouble. When I opened the door, I looked up and I just saw it there, looking back at me. Then it just disappeared. My sister insisted that I stay in the doorway until she was done drying off and getting dressed.

It came back every once in awhile. For about a year, my sister would lock the door to the bedroom when she took a shower and I would lean up against the wall next to the bathroom door which would always be open.

One night, I watched the figure walk right in front of my bed. It scared the hell out of me.

Eventually he got himself a friend because I woke up once to see a black figure looking down on me. I walked over to my sister's bed and slept next to her that night.

When I was 15, my brother was killed in a car accident. He wasn't speeding, they said he fell asleep at the wheel and went off the road. The date was October 30th 2003rd. After recent events, I doubt that.

When I was 17, on October 28th 2006, I was in a car. My friend was driving and he hit the gas at a stop light, after the light turned green. He didn't know why. He went around a corner too fast and lost control. He went in to a skid and our car went over the yellow line where we were hit by oncoming traffic. I was in the hospital for 23 days. The doctors had to revive me twice. I lost my spleen, shattered my pelvis, and ended up in a wheel chair for three months.

Everything fell quiet. The occurrences, the noises, they all stopped (except for the ghost lady mentioned above, still saw her). Everything was normal until February 4th of this year.

I saw the translucent figure, he stepped in front of me and stopped, I think he was facing me. I think he was taunting me. He disappeared and a few minutes later, the phone rang. The caller was the police.

My dad was driving down the road from my house with my mother and my sister in the car. While he was going past a stop light, (it was green) a drunk driver slammed in to the passenger side of his car. The Ford 150 the drunk driver was driving cut my father's car in half. My mother and father were killed instantly. My sister almost didn't survive. She has brain damage. She has no memory loss, but her coordination and motor skills were affected.

Since then, it started all over. All the noises and occurrences are back. Except for the translucent ghost, it has disappeared and hasn't shown up since February fourth.

A Hauntingly Quiet Night at Brougham Way / Aesthetic Crossroads Gallery,"California, United States",Ghost Hunting,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Ghost Hunting :: A Hauntingly Quiet Night at Brougham Way / Aesthetic Crossroads Gallery

I heard the reports about this residential haunting and heard that there was a lot of activity coming from this house. I had to check it out and called upon HPI paranormal investigators: Chris Grissom, Debbie Talani, Angel Kesti, psychic Anne Temple. We were equipped with two EMF Readers, 3 digital cameras, 2 Listen Up Sound Enhancers and 3 electronic audio recorders. We all met up at this home and mapped out areas of this home that really needed to be looked at, areas we felt had the most activity. It was November 9, 2007, Friday and besides anticipating the long weekend, I was hoping we would get some nice results for this Friday night. I sat in two closets by myself for a period of 20 minutes each, hoping to capture some kind of photographic evidence or hear something on my Listen Up sound enhancer. I had no results. When interviewing Occupant #1 of this home, she told me that the house is 30 years old. Occupant #1 did some investigating on her own by digging up some old County records. She discovered a man named Harold lived in this house with his Asian bride, he worked as an employee for a computer company. Harold died of heart failure in this home. She believes that Harold still resides in her home, along with a little boy possibly named Stephen and a small girl. Occupant #1 verified that the former occupant's named was Harold from her neighbors.

Occupant #1 relates to me that on February 2007, the activity started in their home. They purchased 2 beds from a Thrift shop and believe that the little boy and little girl haunt the beds. Occupant #1's boyfriend has heard footsteps on the stairwell, while Occupant #1 has heard the footsteps that go from the stairwell to the extended kitchen area. One night she heard the footsteps, went down to investigate and opened a door and the footsteps stopped. Occupant #1 started doing her own EVP work and picked up EVPs that say:

EVP: When asked...""how did you die?"" Possibly Stephen (boy ghost): ""I drowned"".

Occupant #1 said that she had a foster child, and her foster child had a cousin that was into the Goth culture. Many times she caught this Goth oriented child rambling or chanting around the house, which could have brought more activity to their home. This is a theory that was presented to me by Occupant #1. Occupant #1 thought this child was maybe practicing in the mystical arts. Occupant #1 said that some other unusual activity is that the TV would shut off on it's own and once when she was opening the closet a cold gush of cold wind blew out.

Anne Temple, a medium and HPI member, claims she was talking with the little boy named Stephen. It was Anne who discovered the entity's possible full name. Anne elaborates that Stephen's full name is Stephen (middle name maybe Michael) (last name maybe Warner or Warmer). Anne says that Stephen was 10 years old when he drowned at the American River near Folsom. Stephen says he lived in Carmichael and that the bed belongs to him. Stephen parent's names are possibly Nancy and David, the parents may still be alive and may have lived on a street or circle off Winding Way called Steiner? He claims he can't find his way back.

After the investigation, I checked to see if any of the investigators caught any kind of photographic evidence, there was none. Debbie smelled a cookie smell that came from the kitchen and possible cigarette smoke in the bathroom area. No one smokes in this house. Debbie says that she felt a yanking of her hair twice. Anne detected heaviness in the air in one of the closets and felt like Stephen likes to play hide 'n seek with us. Chris didn't feel anything or see anything. I didn't feel anything or see anything.

Later Anne showed Debbie, Angel, Chris and I, on how to see auras that surround peoples' bodies. When testing this experiment out, there seems to be a whiteness around everyone body. Anne claims this is our aura. I wasn't sure if this was the aura I was seeing or a trick of my own eyes. It was an interesting experiment nevertheless.

I heard past EVPs of prior investigations by HPI that were impressive, but on this night, everything seemed relatively quiet. We know this house has lots of ghostly activity, we just didn't capture any this night. This ends this investigation now let me tell you about other HPI events and activities!

Holly DeLaughter, HPI paranormal investigator has created a photo album with images of various investigators on duty, scenes of various places we have investigated, this photo album will be transferred soon to the HPI Meetup site, but for right now, you can stop by and check them out here:

Jon Almada, paranormal investigator-in-training for HPI wrote his own report on the Gaines Residence, you can find the information here:

It's funny, when I am busy writing articles, I will get Yahoo instant messenger pop up messages, Chris Grissom will update me on some of his HPI projects and buzz the bell on my Yahoo Messenger which practically makes me jump out of my seat and I reply to him...""I don't do porn anymore... I don't care if you have your own website with pictures!"" Chris gets a good laugh and of course, I am ONLY JOKING! I did get an interesting instant messenger from a lady that calls herself Bianca - The Lady with the Third Eye. She claims she had a vision that when we near the year 2012, the Mayan year of Doomsday, there will be a 'changling' that comes upon the world that will commit heinous crimes of murder and be able to walk away from a murder scene never to be caught. This changling can change from looking like a silver haired man to looking like a high school prom queen. The police will be frowned upon by the public, because they can't capture this serial kille, changling. This will set the motion of disorder in our society. I must admit that this is an interesting story from Bianca and I had to cut her short on the instant messaging, because I had a hard time swallowing her visional tale of the Apocalypse. Being in the paranormal business, I get all kinds of strange calls, emails and instant messages. This was just one of many.

If you haven't had a chance to look at some of our cool paranormal investigative photos, some of them have been posted at our HPI Meetup site, which can be found here:

Today is Saturday, November 10, 2007 and things are going to liven up with HPI. At 5:30pm I am heading over to the grand opening of Aesthetic Crossroads Gallery, 1901 8th Street (8th and S Street), this is where Shannon 'Ms. Macabre' McCabe is putting on an event to promote the place where she works, A Florist Naturally www.afloristnaturally.com and the new art gallery/ wine bar. When arriving I was greeted by fellow paranormal investigators: Donna Reynolds, Carol Gillis, Debbie Talani, Shannon McCabe, Holly DeLaughter. The atmosphere was lively, Martin Purtill was belting out mellow folk songs, while potential clients were feasting on the various types of cheese, crackers and wine. I was amazed at all of the gorgeous artwork in this gallery in which some of the paintings were being sold for astronomical prices! Shannon took me around and introduced me to some of the people at this gallery. There were two ladies that really stood out during my introductions one was Lyn Asio, the owner of the gallery/ wine bar. She explained to me her success story with this gallery, and I could see the passion and enthusiasm in her eyes while she discussed her rise in the art and wine world. Shannon introduced me to her co-worker, Renee Reibel who has the ability of looking at a painting and creating a floral arrangement from the painting. She does this with lightning speed and it was absolutely amazing to watch. Her talent is phenomenal. It was very nice to take a break from ghost hunting and enjoy the festivities at this event. Shannon is one of the greatest event coordinators I have ever met and she is a superb hostess. She makes everyone feel relaxed and comfortable in their surroundings. Shannon walked around with a big beaming smile on her face and wore one of her signature, custom made corsets, that made her definitely stand out in the crowd. I found myself relaxing with a glass of wine, my fellow investigators, and some cheese, as we discussed past cases and upcoming cases. The conversation that we had, excelled when discussing our findings as people not associated with HPI listened on with curiosity. HPI members have a strong bonding and it's not because of the cases we go on, but events like this that enable us to actually get to know each other on a personal level. This creates a bonding so strong, that we have become family.

As I drove home, wouldn't you know it, the song 'We Are Family' by Sister Sledge came on the radio. This event ended a perfect weekend with HPI.

I have always been a believer in the supernatural but never really had what I would consider an ""experience"" until I was 15. I was working in a nursing home as a dietary aide, my mother also worked there and had her own office, I had heard many stories about people seeing things or hearing things from many of the people that worked there.

One day I was sitting in my mom office behind her desk with the door closed and my sister decided to walk by, open the door, and shut the light off on me, at first I was like ""ok yeah ha ha real funny"", but then as I was sitting there in the dark I noticed a figure that I was only able to see because of the light shining through the cracks of the door, at first I thought it was something sitting on the desk I had overlooked, so I decided to reach out and see what it was, well my hand went through it, I wasn't spooked at first but then I sat back down and I realized I was looking at the head of an older woman, when that realization set in I booked it out of there, I told my mother about it and she said she has seen her on many occasions, even in the light, which I later found to be odd because going back in the office, I was able to see the woman only when the light was off and a small amount of light was behind her.

Everybody I showed her to was able to see her, it was like a moment caught in time or something, I'm just wondering if anyone else has had a similar experience such as this.

Granddad's Mother Was Waiting for Him,United Kingdom,Family / Friends Visits,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Family / Friends Visits :: Granddad's Mother Was Waiting for Him

T his isn't an experience of my own but of my Grandfather... My Granddad on my mother's side passed away a couple of years back. He was just about to turn 81 when he died and was quite a religious man. His health wasn't good for the past few years of his life and he was in and out of hospital regularly with chest infections. He was not in anyway senile though... He became quite tired and didn't chat so much towards the end but he still had his wits about him. He used to tease me about my hair which was always multi-colored at that point - he would ask me to dye the little hair he had left the same colour.

About a year before he passed away, he told my aunt this story... He was lying in bed, just wakening up as the light came through the windows and he saw his mother standing at the end of the bed. He said she was not the old woman she had been when she died. Instead she was young and dressed how he remembered her when he was a child. She was standing at the end of the bed surrounded by bright light. She told him she was waiting for him but it was not his time yet, but that she would be waiting for him when it was time.

My aunt burst out into tears on hearing this, that side of my family are very religious Irish people, so my aunt of course believed he had saw his mother. He had no reason to lie and I have no reason to think it was 'just old age' or seeing things because he had never mentioned anything like this before and wasn't senile. As I said, he died about a year later. My uncle who he lived with, found him staring intently at the cross on his wall as he took his last breath.

At his wake, his coffin was laid out and people came to mourn and see him. I told my aunt I did not feel like he was gone at all and she said she felt the same. Maybe it just hadn't sunk in that he was gone, but I was later left to look after my young cousin who was about 3 years old and I was trying to keep him entertained when I suddenly felt that someone was watching us from the doorway. I turned round and of course there was no one there. I was a little spooked but felt strongly that it was my granddad watching us. I don't know why but I don't feel like he was lingering around long-term, I felt like he was still with the family until he was buried.

Some Haunting Experiences,"Maryland, United States",Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: Some Haunting Experiences

M y name is Joe. I am autistic. To tell you the truth, I'm actually afraid of ghosts because I'm sensitive to things that pop out of nowhere. I am going to list a few haunting experiences. One morning, one year and half ago, I woke up to find that my fan had turned on by itself. It was really early and my dad said that he didn't do it. Me and my dad were the only ones in that apartment.

I don't actually remember this but in the year of 2006, I think a ghost was making noises in my dad's apartment and I told the ghost something. After that, I felt someone touch me.

My dad owned a table that used to belong to my great grandparents. I think it was haunted because it seemed like if someone was sitting on it. It would always make noises. I thought it was my great grandfather, still enjoying it. My great grandmother died last february, it still made noises before she died.

One time when I was alone in the apartment, I was brushing my teeth when I thought I saw a young man's legs walking in a bedroom. It could of been my imagination but still...

I always felt scared to go in the family room in my mom's apartment. I always felt that I was being watched in that room...

My Grandfather and my Mother,"Maine, United States",Family / Friends Visits,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Family / Friends Visits :: My Grandfather and my Mother

M y grandfather died of cancer when my mom was only 12 years old, but my mom happened to be out of the house at the time of his actual death. My grandmother told me exactly how he died. My grandfather was bed-ridden and on the edge of death for a long time. On the day of his death my grandmother was standing beside him and he said ""I see jesus..."" she asked him what he meant and he said that jesus was coming from the ceiling with one arm out in front of him, to take him away to heaven. My grandfather was a strong christian, and always believed that he would go to heaven when he died. My grandmother told me my grandfather then raised his hand as if to grab the hand of someone else, closed his eyes, actually raised slightly out of the bed then dropped back down and laid still. He was dead.

That night, my mom had a dream where my grandfather came to her and told her that he was in heaven and that she shouldn't worry anymore, and that he was okay. She told him she was still scared, and she instantly woke up and saw him standing at the edge of her bed. He told her personally that he was okay, and that he loved her. Then he vanished, and she felt at peace with his death.

Fireflies,"Michigan, United States",Orbs / Lights / Mists,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Orbs / Lights / Mists :: Fireflies

A s a young child, one of my favorite pass times was to catch and count fireflies. We had a small backyard, so occasionally we would go down the street and across to a small park that was not particularly friendly to find some. This usually happened when the family was over and we ran out of room for the large amounts of people in our home. Our parents would walk us down there and sit talking while us kids ran around yelling and screaming.

We would then head home. My sister and her crew would be wearing jewelry they made by pulling off the butts of the fireflies and I would be carrying a sun tea jar that I had set up as a kind of apartment for them until we got home where I would set them free. On this particular day, we kids stayed outside in the tool shed that we set up as a playhouse until it got cold and then we went to the basement.

We were playing the usual things: roller skating the length of the room to grab onto a support beam to see how fast we could spin around, board games, setting up house in the room under the stairs, and breaking into my father's dark room. We were absolutely, under no circumstances allowed in there as he was always working on new photographs in various stages of development and experimentation.

Right about the time the neighbor boy and I broke into the darkroom my Mother came yelling down the stairs that whoever let the fireflies free inside the house had made a bad decision. We had forgotten them out in the shed, so we knew it wasn't us.

As we went up the stairs to go outside and prove it was not us we heard the adults talking about the fireflies down the hall blinking and bouncing all over. My uncle states that with the blinking it was hard to tell, but he thought there were maybe five in the house. As he tried to approach to capture them, the light would go out and he could not find where they went. My grandmother says that they looked agitated. She always said it was as if they were expecting a bug zapper would jump out of no where and attack them.

Out in the shed, the jar lid was still on tight. My sisters fireflies were, well... Gone. She was wearing them. None of us had taken any in the house. All of the kids though had to search the house and try to rid it of these fireflies. None were ever found. We were not allowed to put them in a jar after that. Coincidence on the timing of the break-in and the fireflies or was it something more?

The Man in Palmer Park,"Colorado, United States",Apparitions / Voices / Touches,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Apparitions / Voices / Touches :: The Man in Palmer Park

T his story took place about 12 years ago. I was 14 and living in a townhouse on the north end of Colorado Springs with both my older brother and my grandmother. Our home was right on the edge of a park called Palmer Park. It's a huge park that really looks more like the woods. People go there to hike, mountain bike, etc. I would often go there after school with friends to hang out before going home. There was a pavilion not far from the entrance of the park that we used to sit at to talk.

One day, myself and 2 friends of mine were at the pavilion doing the usual when I realized that it had gotten dark and that I had to get home. So I started on my short trip home alone, leaving my 2 buddies behind me. Half way home, I noticed what looked like the figure of a man standing amongst the trees. At first I thought that it might have been my brother coming to let me know how much trouble I was in, but the closer I got the more that I could see that it wasn't my brother at all. I even spoke ""hello"" to the person as I passed by, but ""he"" didn't even make a sound. I could clearly see that whatever it was, was watching me. I actually saw his body shift as I passed. That's when I got scared and started running. I ran until I got home, and when I did, I quickly shut the sliding glass door, locked it and looked outside toward the park as I caught my breath.

Now I know that some people might say that it was ""just some guy"". Or a tree, or that maybe I was imagining the whole thing but I wasn't. I saw the figure of a man standing there watching me. It was weird because I remember that I was only few feet away and could not see his face, and the body looked more like a shadow of a body instead of the real thing.

Finally 5 minutes or so after I made it home I saw both of my friends walking along the parking lot. As they walked passed my door, I opened it and asked if they'd seen anyone in the park as they walked out. They both said no (of course). I will never forget that night. Although I'm not exactly sure if it were a ghost or not. I cannot come up with any explanation as to what happened. The time was too close, and if what I saw would have went deeper into the park my friends would have seen it on their way out. If it came into the complex I would have seen it coming towards me.

Anyone have any speculations? Please, I would love to hear them. Thank you all again.

Buddhist Prayers for Civil War Dead,"Virginia, United States",Poltergeists / Physical Manifestations,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Poltergeists / Physical Manifestations :: Buddhist Prayers for Civil War Dead

I am a Buddhist nun, called an ani. I live near the Manassas Battlefields in Virginia, and I've frequently gone there to pray for the lives that were lost so tragically. The battlefields cover many miles, and some of the bloodiest battles of the US Civil War were fought in that area. Many Buddhists believe that praying for the dead can help them, especially if they died in confusion or misery. I wanted to help anyone trapped there if I could.

A couple of years ago I went to the battlefields as usual and did my prayers. This time I chose a new site, the location of a mass grave of unknown Union and Confederate soldiers. I thought how horrible it was that these young people died and were buried, without their families ever knowing conclusively what happened.

When I returned home that day, my television set turned itself on and off, twice. It has never done that before, or since. I prayed again, and asked forgiveness from any spirit I may have brought home with me.

I haven't been back there since. I've always heard that the intent of the prayers is what matters, not the faith. But I think maybe I offended a spirit out there, because when my tv turned itself on and off, I felt my hair stand on end and an awful feeling in my stomach.

My Old Appartment Haunting,"Virginia, United States",Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: My Old Appartment Haunting

L et me start off by stating that I have lived in what could be considered haunted houses on and off my whole life (currently 31), including both of the apartments I moved into upon leaving my parent's home. I've seen as few things that I can't 100% explain, felt things, and even ""know"" things that I probably shouldn't.

This story is about my old apt - Pinewell Commons. I moved in mid-year in 1997. It's a 3 story brick, OLD building (built in the 1920's). The units are seriously small (less than 300sqft) but considering I was 21 and poor, it was priced right. In the middle of the building was an elevator - the very first day I saw it, I didn't like it. Didn't know why, didn't really care, just gave me the willies. My apt was on the second floor, on the backside. For the first year or so, I didn't spend much time in my apt due to work and family issues, so if anything happened, I never noticed it.

It wasn't until year 3 that I started to notice things. The first was a male figure, dressed in an old Seacoat, smoking a pipe, who would walk down the main staircase at odd hours. I thought he was a new tenant and basically ignored him. Until one day, while carrying up my laundry from the basement, I met him in the hallway. He was standing at the landing of my floor, staring at me, pipe in his mouth. I opened my mouth to say excuse me and he disappeared. Yeah... I double take'd, but shrugged it off and logged it away. I would see him every great once and awhile, but always at odd hours.

Nothing else happened for a while until I spotted a new figure - this time a woman, almost a year later. She was slowly walking down the hallway, but that wasn't the alarming bit. She was dressed in late 19th/20th century clothing, complete with bustle and feather fan. She turned toward me, I remember seeing her bright green eyes over the fan. She nodded at me then disappeared. Again, I logged it but didn't let it worry me and continued on my way.

About this time I gained a boyfriend, who for lack of better wording, was dabbling in the arts. He was also slightly mentally unwell. Well, unfortunately for me, he did something, brought something, whatever in to ""view"" that I wasn't overly excited with. It started with a figure walking back and forth in front of my front door. When I would look out the peep-hole, no one was there. A few weeks of this, then it changed. Now, when the footsteps started, you could see shadows underneath the door, but still nothing visible in the hallway.

Then one day I heard the footsteps again and this time they stopped, directly in front of the door. I could see the shadow of the feet. I got up to check and this complete and utter terror overtook me. I knew if I got close to that door something VERY bad was going to happen. I sat back down on my sofa for 4 hours waiting, until I looked over and noticed the shadows gone. Shortly after, I broke up with that man. Although I would hear the footsteps once and awhile after, I never got that gut wrenching feeling of terror again.

Then, for almost another year, nothing major happened. I continued to see both the Old Man and the Painted Lady (and I started to call them) and I gained a new boyfriend. This time things worked out great, but new things started to occur in the apt. First was the elevator - it was flooded during a hurricane and stopped working. I always got a strange sense of fear from it, but now I was almost dreading walking by the doors. Late at night, you could hear the car shifting in the shaft (or that's what I hoped it was) and I swear it sounded angry. Yes, angry. And it wasn't just me who felt like that, both my boyfriend and several friends also told me the same thing.

Another new disturbance was the Shower Ghost. Laugh all you want, but I used to enjoy long soaks in the shower after work. It relaxed and refreshed me, but around year 5 strange things started happening. After spending a few in the shower, the curtain would attack me. At first I thought it was the steam build-up, I would put bottles on the edge and leave the door open. It would still do it, even if I was taking a cold shower. I kind of blew it off until one day, I fell asleep in the shower. I started having this dream where this man was trying to wake me up, he was afraid I was going to drown. He kept hitting me, over and over. Finally, I snapped awake when the curtain blew in and knocked off all 6 bottles. Afterwards, I got the impression that somebody wanted me out of the shower, fearing I was going to drown. This continued to the day we left that apt (note: it NEVER did this to my boyfriend, who often took scalding hot showers).

A few more noteworthy occurrences happened, a few fell into the world of ghosts, others I'm still not sure of. Names being called, things touching me, small items moved, the cat often acting freaked out. The biggest thing I recall was what I call the Baby scream. One afternoon I was sleeping, on my stomach, my face toward the headboard. I was out cold when a scream woke me up. Upon opening my eyes, directly in front of me should have been the headboard, but I saw a baby's face. It's mouth was opened in a scream and its eyes were squeezed shut. I recoiled in shock and it faded away instantly. I'm not sure what it was, but it has never repeated itself - there or anywhere else.

The last major thing to start happening the last year or so we were at that apt, was the solid white forms. What would appear to be the opposite of a shadow (white outline) in the form of a human male, would walk by doorways in the apt. Always out of the corner of your eyes or from beside you, never looking straight on. Also, this would occur in any doorway in the apt (there was 6 doors in a 1 room apt) including the closet. Many people saw these: my boyfriend, several friends, my youngest sister and myself. They were never threatening, just alarming.

After 8 long years, we finally moved. Not far, just 2 miles down the road. They (new landlords) renovated the building and re-leased it out. I've never been back to check if anything still happens, but often wondered. But I've got the new place to worry about now...

Who Else Lives Here?,"District of Columbia, United States",Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: Who Else Lives Here?

M y husband and I purchased and moved into a brand new apartment in a very urban area. For the first few months we were settling in and didn't really notice anything out of the ordinary. After about four months of living here I started noticing a few odd things happening. Occasionally I would see something out of the corner of my eye that looked person shaped. The most frequent occurrence was that the water in the kitchen would turn itself off and on. I would also find the lights on when I was sure I had turned them off, I would find household items out of place. Then the light in our bedroom started turning itself off and on when we were right there in the room.

I started to think that the place was haunted. My husband tried to write it all off as water pressure changes or construction defects. He did have a point. The faucet that was turning off and on was one that could easily be influenced by odd pressure changes that do happen in new high rise buildings. The light that was turning off and on was one that was on a timer and could have been being triggered by stray signals from someone's remote. The one thing that made me wonder if this was all happening by design was that often the lights going off and on or the water going off and on would happen when we were talking about the possibility of a ghost. Almost like some intelligence was making a point.

Knowing that some of this could be easily explainable I started talking to the ghost. I said that the things that were happening were all really relatively easy to explain away and if someone was trying to communicate with me or get my attention they would have to work a little harder. Things changed after that. The lights that were turning off and on now were lights on a switch and not on a timer. We started finding the bathroom faucet on at times (a different type of faucet that is harder to turn off and on). The toilet seat started to be left in the up position which we never do (we have cats that like playing in there). The things that had first caught our attention stopped and these more difficult to explain away things started happening instead.

Our cats react to what is going on. I have seen my older cat get up on his hind legs and dance across the room like he is trying to grab onto something that is just out of his reach. Our younger cat (who is a lot more skittish) often gets freaked out and runs away from something while the older cat goes toward the area they were looking at and acts like he is greeting a friend. When we adopted our youngest cat we were keeping her segregated in our bathroom and the light went on by itself. She freaked out. I got mad and yelled at the ""ghost"" that they were scaring the baby and I would not have that. For about 4 weeks everything was very quiet and nothing happened but then slowly things resumed.

One day I was in the bedroom with both cats and it sounded like our front door opened. I was so convinced that it did that I called out to my husband asking him what he was doing home so early. Both cats ran toward the front door as they usually do to say ""Hi"" to my husband when he gets home from work. I heard the sound of footsteps coming down the hall but when they passed the bedroom door no one was there. The younger cat freaked out, ran to me, and jumped in my arms. The older cat followed the sound of the footsteps into the kitchen where they just stopped.

Sometimes I think the ghost has a bit of a sense of humor. I was watching a DVD of the show Ghost Hunters and there was a crash in the kitchen and pans were thrown off the stove. Both cats were laying on me at the time which eliminated the most obvious cause. It scared the heck out of me since I was watching a tense episode! Then, after I settled in again the water in the bathroom started turning itself off and on.

Probably the weirdest thing that has happened is hearing someone say ""Hello. Hello"" when no one else was around. I was packing to go on a trip and had dragged my suitcase into our entry way. The youngest cat was riding on the suitcase. I turned towards our living room where I distinctly heard a voice say ""Hello. Hello..."" It sounded like a male voice. The voice had an odd, flat quality to it. Every hair on my body stood on end. The cat also heard it because every hair on her body also stood on end and she jumped into my arms and tried to crawl into my shirt. I said ""Hello"" back and asked if there is anything I could do to help them get to the other side and asked if they were here to tell me something but there was no response.

I could go on and on about the little things that have convinced me that someone else is here. I have had a few other things happen in my adult life that were odd, mostly in connection with my Mom's death but for some reason I don't feel this is my Mom. I don't feel scared at all and do not feel that this ghost or spirit is malicious in any way. I have come to believe that they want to communicate with me for a reason other than to let me know they are here. I just don't know what or why but when the time comes I hope I am paying attention.

My Papa,"Texas, United States",Misc,"L et me first start of by saying, there are many things that go on in my family. Like relatives calling after they have passed or scents coming in the room to comfort you or right before something happens. My mother use to tell me about these things growing up and when we were old enough to understand. I never really put much thought into them. I think on a personal level I didn't really want to believe in them.

In 1999, I experience my first of many visits (as I like to call them). My Ex and daughter's father committed suicide. I experience the first visit while at the viewing in the funeral home. They have happened many many times after that. To the point that my daughter has gotten really afraid to be in her room alone. I couldn't understand why she was all of a sudden afraid and at the age of 9. She was with me one night in my room and looked out the door towards the den. I will never forget the look on her face, it chilled me so much, I had to get up and close the door. She proceeded to tell me that there was a man sitting on our couch. At first I reassured her no one was in the house. The look on her face and her actions proved me wrong. I left it alone after closing the door and we didn't speak of it any further that evening. She slept with me that night.

The next day I asked her to describe who she saw. Down to the color of the baseball cap, he was her Father. I explain this to her and told her that he was not there to hurt her. He was probably wanting to check up on her and look over her. I explain to her that if he really scares you, you can ask him to leave. I don't know if she ever did this or not, but to this day, we have had nothing go on involving him. He has been around us since the day at the funeral home and he will have been gone 9 years next year. The couch event happened last year.

Now getting on to the real purpose of my story and writing on here... My Papa passed away November 6, 2007. I was always closed to my Papa and really enjoyed his company the older we got. I would love to sit and hear his stories that he would tell over and over again. His health started going down about August of this year. He slowly was not able to get around at all. He started sleeping more and more everyday. He started to not be able to understand things that were going on around him. As my grandmother and aunt took him to the doctor appointments and he started fighting the nurses and doctors. Around the beginning of September he began complaining that it hurt to eat or drink anything. As the doctors did scopes of his throat there seem to be nothing wrong. There was conversation of a feeding tube, which he said no, he wouldn't do that. He just stopped eating and drinking all together. He was just being really mean to the nurses that were trying to take care of him and run test.

After a few weeks of moving him around from hospitals and nursing homes, they decided to bring him home and set him up so he could rest in his home. During this period I was really sick and was told I couldn't/shouldn't go see him, as he may catch something from me and worsen. I stayed away for almost two months, as it took me that long to get well. My Grandmother's birthday was November 5th. I called her and spoke with her and said I was coming over to see them the next day, and I wanted to make sure they would be around and not out at doctor appts. She assured me they would be and I told her I would see them tomorrow.

That evening as I was deep asleep I was shaken awake. At the moment I was opening my eyes I assumed it was one of my children that had a nightmare or something. However, I open my eyes to a lady with short brown hair standing at the side of my bed with her face directly over mine. It startled me, so I attempted to move but felt as though my covers were being held tight so I could not move. I tried to say something and I was unable to speak. She was directly over my face about a foot from my face with her eyes looking directly at me and her mouth open in a strange, almost scary sort of way. She never said anything but only stayed that way a few minutes to make sure I was fully awake I guess. She then turned and walked towards my bedroom door. Once she got to my bedroom door, it was like she just vanished. The door never opened or anything. I was shocked, just trying to figure out what had happened. Was I dreaming? Was I awake? I finally was able to move and just laid most the night awake in my bed.

Now, I've had so many visits in the past 9 years that they usually do not freak me out. However, this one... Bothered me. There was something strange about the entire deal.

I got up the next morning and as I had gotten out of the shower and was starting to get ready to go to my grandparents house, my mother called. She started talking as if I knew what was going on, I learned that they had given my Papa 24 hours, if that. So, I threw on some clothes, went and got my mother. When we arrived at the house my Aunt, Uncle and Father were already at the house. I was not sure what to expect as I had not seen him in awhile. As I walked in the room, he laid in his hospital bed, with his mouth open, very sick. Everyone else teared up and got emotional, I sort of just looked at him. I didn't leave that room or his side but only to go to the bathroom and for a 20 minute break all day. My mother later told me I was stubborn and wouldn't leave him...

But, I wanted to be there with him, even if I wasn't sure he even knew I was there. I felt like I'd missed a lot of time with him as he progressed into this state and I wanted to spend as much time as I could with him. He was going quickly and I didn't want to miss a single second. I held his hand and rubbed his arm, as they were so cold. There were a few times he raised his eyebrows or pushed on the nurse as she tried to take his temp. I knew he was still there with us and could hear us. The nurse had told us that we should talk to him and reassure him, but that's a hard thing to do.

As the day and early night went on, I sat and watched him. I would count his breathes and rub his hand. I would catch myself, saying inside breathe Papa, breathe. I didn't really want him to hang on, as I knew he was in pain. But, I didn't want to let go of him just yet. He finally got to where he started taking one breath and then would stop for a minute. Over and over again. As he had some many different breathing patterns all day, I knew it was close. I looked over at the nurse and told her. She got her watch and we both stared. I moved my chair up to his bed real close, so that I can continue to hold his hand and rub his shoulder and put my head down, towards him. I started to cry and was very overwhelmed all of a sudden. I looked at his face and his mouth was different, more peacefully open. His face didn't look like it had looked that morning and he seemed more at ease. I finally as I was holding him, said it's okay Papa, go ahead and go. We will be okay.

After the fact and after we buried him and later spoke about all that went on. I finally told about the brown-haired lady the night before I went over to see him. It freaks me out and gives me chills to speak about her to this day. My mother seems to think she was telling me I had to go the next day. What is really strange is that she held her mouth the exact way my Papa was laying there with his open most the day. Maybe she was trying to tell me to go see him. I hope I never see her again.

Ferotni,Malaysia,Apparitions / Voices / Touches,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Apparitions / Voices / Touches :: Ferotni

W hen I was 4 and stayed over at my uncle's house in Bangladesh, he used to tell us stories about his house being haunted. His stories were funny and didn't scare us. One day I was near the village well. I sat down on the floor leaning my bach against the well when I felt something pinch me. I turned but there was no one there. I continued to brush the hair on my toy rabbit's hair when I felt it again.

I then remembered that my uncle once said that a girl's ghost haunts his house and she liked pinching people. I got scared and ran back to the house.

I was sitting next to my great-grandma and watched her kneed some dough to make pita bread. My cousin were calling me up. I followed them up. My cousins found a frog and started to play with it.

I suddenly heard a little girl crying. I looked at my cousins and counted them, they were all there so I was wondering who was crying. My uncle called me so I went at the top of the stairs. He said who is that crying. I said I don't know. It was coming from the bathroom. I went there and screamed.

All of my cousins came, my uncle as well. My oldest cousin grabbed me and hugged me. There, right in front of us was a ferotni - a ferotni's are woman who don't pass on and turned into horrible beasts, they come at night near trees and rip off the hair on other girls (they do that because they are jealous of our hair)

She got up and ran to the roof. My uncle and cousin chased after her. But by the time they go there she was gone. They searched everywhere but she was no-where to be seen.

The next day they got the house blessed and never saw the girl again.

Stuck in my Boyfriend's Haunted Apartment,"Michigan, United States",Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: Stuck in my Boyfriend's Haunted Apartment

M y boyfriend, Jason, and I have been together almost 6 months now. He has lived in his apartment for almost a year, and I still technically live at home with my parents. However, I do spend a great deal of time at his place whether or he is home.

Ever since I have been coming over, I have felt a strange presence in his apartment. I constantly feel as though I am being watched at an uncomfortably close distance. There is also a constant tapping and banging on the walls. The tapping and banging is almost rhythmic and always happens when I feel like I am being watched. No one is in the apartment next to us so I have ruled out the neighbors.

Also, in the computer room, the window and door will open and close on their own. However, the one room I hate to go into the most is the utility room. The utility room feels as though there is an ominous presence in it that definitely does not want you there. No matter how tightly you close the door to it, it will always be cracked open within 15 minutes as though someone is peeking out at you.

The lights also tend to flicker on and off throughout the apartment. Not to mention gusts of wind when there isn't any window open, and what sounds like very soft whispering.

When all of this first started happening to me, I was usually there by myself. I would then of course ask my boyfriend about it, and he would say something like ""oh, that's probably just the walls settling or something"". However, one day I had come over for dinner and he asked me if I had ever gotten stuck in the computer room. I asked him what he meant by stuck and he said the door slammed shut and he couldn't get it open again. He said it had taken him almost 10 minutes to be able to pry the door open. I could tell that he was very shaken up by this.

Needless to say, we are currently looking for a new place to live; however, for the time being we are still stuck here.

Haunted in Low Income Housing,"Massachusetts, United States",Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: Haunted in Low Income Housing

T his has to be the most significant haunting that not only I experienced but my whole family. This happened years ago. I was living in Connecticut at the time with my sister, her son who was 2 and my son who was 2 also. I was pregnant with my daughter at the time. We had moved into a very nice 4 bedroom apartment.

When we first moved in, everything was how should we say normal. About 6 months of living in this apartment, very strange things started to happen. The cabinet doors in the kitchen would be open in the morning when we knew that we closed them the night before, and the hall light would never work no matter who fixed it, we even had the management of the complex have an electrician man check it out, even he said there should be no reason for the light not to work. These things just made my sister and I sort of laugh.

But a couple of months went by and our experiences started to become even more strange, even scary. Our sons bedroom was always freezing no matter how high we had the heat, my son would not sleep in it at all I could put him in there and he would cry and scream; I hadn't slept alone for a long time (lol). And our downstairs' closet always smelt like kerosene which really scared us into calling the fire department. They couldn't explain the smell but told us that it wouldn't harm us (they ran different carbon tests).

Well one night when my mom babysat my nephew while my sister was at work, she was sitting on the couch reading and my nephew was supposedly sleeping in the freezing room. My mom heard him talking to someone, when she went to check on him, he was sitting up in his bed, she asked him who are you talking to? He said the mean bubbi (yiddish for grandmother) in the window told me she would be back, now to remind you he is only two, maybe two and a half. My mom was freaked. When she told me this story, it sent chills down my spine. I do have more stories about this apartment. I feel that I made this story long enough but I really feel that this was more significant then some of the others. I wish I did some research on this apartment. I can only imagine the history. I look forward to hearing from you all.

My Husband's House,"Florida, United States",Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: My Husband's House

I am telling a story that I did not experience, but that my husband has relayed to me. I have recently become very interested in ghost phenomenon, so I decided to post his story on this web site. It began in a small and not very old home (the home was probably build in the early 1980s) that was owned by my husband's late father. The home is located in northern Georgia at the foothills of the Appalachians. The home is located on a paved road, with a few other homes around, but the surrounding area consists of the Chattahoocee National Forest. My husband has relayed several strange happenings that he and others experienced when he was in his teens.

The first thing that my husband told me was that one night, about 15 years ago, he saw a woman dressed in Victorian period clothing walk across his back yard from the woods. He was outside at the time on the other end of the yard. The woman was a ghostly apparition, he is sure of it. She went to the back door then left the way she came.

He also told me of time when he had a friend to sleep over. While trying to go to sleep, his friend felt something touch his feet. This was pretty frightening for both of them. Both my husband and his friend have spoken of strange experiences in that same room, but have not went in to much detail.

One other thing that my husband shared with me was that of a mirror. He claims he saw strange things in the mirror. He came across to me like this was evil in nature and possibly some sort of gateway. My husband used to dabble (as a teen) in things that he should have left alone such as the occult or Satanism. I am not sure how heavily. I do know he is not involved anymore. I guess it was a teenage fad, as we are both Christians. Also my husband did not want to throw away the mirror, but we kept it for years, put away in an out building. I cannot remember what happened to it. I think it broke or got thrown away in one of our moves. In a way it just seems to have disappeared.

Another tidbit of information about this home is that after my father in law died in the home of ALS, we moved into the home. I never experienced anything strange, excepted maybe fear from what I have heard. But, my aunt came to visit us one day (she had not known about anything that I have just written) and she told my mother that she sensed something evil on the property. My aunt seems pretty reliable, she has always been into things like smudging her home, etc.

The reason why I write this story is just to get some opinion on it. I would like to know more about my husbands experiences. And although I don't want to go against my religion or experience anything evil, I would like to learn how to become more in tune with the other side and possibly have an experience.

Visit with Friends (and Ghosts),Canada,Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: Visit with Friends (and Ghosts)

I n September of this year, myself and my boyfriend were invited to his friends' place for dinner and drinks. I hadn't met these people before but took note of a few things when I walked into their house. There were lots of antiques and an interesting arrangement of things - everything from swords to old doll collections. After saying ""hi"" they immediately took me to the various doll collections. These were from all over the world and almost all very old and each with its own story. Kind of unusual actually.

The couple also had an interesting dynamic, her older by 10 years or so and an intelligent and effective relationship. Odd way to describe a relationship.

Anyway, drinks first. Lots of chit chat. Nothing unusual. Dinner was the same. Then came dessert. Tasty and by this time I was pretty comfortable with them. Then I heard a noise.

The four of us were sitting at the table and the noise was loud enough for everyone to hear, but they didn't react. It came from behind the fellow sitting at the end of the table. As I turned my head toward the sound, I saw something move. It was maybe 5 feet behind this man and it was one of those fold-up room dividers. A big one leaning, folded up, against a wall. This item was swaying back and forth at such angles that there is no way it could do that on its own without falling. So I looked back at the table and continued conversation, then glanced back to see if it was wobbly or if there was any vents or other things that might be disturbing it. Nothing and it was a heavy, antique item that physically just couldn't move like that. When I looked back the second time, it had stopped swaying and was just wobbling a bit.

I decided I needed another glass of wine. I couldn't bring it up because I didn't know these people and first encounters, well, asking who the ghost is didn't seem like the right thing to do.

On the way home my boyfriend said ""they (the couple) said the ghosts were really active today"". He didn't know about any ghosts nor thought they knew (or were of that thinking) at all. I was shocked so I told him what I saw and I said that she (of the couple) knows who it is. That was my sense at the time though she didn't seem to notice at all. My boyfriend said ""I think you were in a heightened awareness state, conscious of it or not, you were and could see, hear and feel something we couldn't"".

A couple of weeks later he told the couple what I saw and heard. They immediately said ""she knows who it is"" (without prompting from my boyfriend) and that they looked forward to seeing me again.

Haven't been back in that area since, but will be in December so stay tuned!

Haunted Leger Hotel / Historic Mokelumne Hill & Gallegos Murder Site,"California, United States",Ghost Hunting,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Ghost Hunting :: Haunted Leger Hotel / Historic Mokelumne Hill & Gallegos Murder Site

I am losing track of my days. It's already Friday, November 16, 2007 and that means I have to get ready for my second investigation of the legendary Hotel Leger (pronounced Lu Zhay) in Mokelumne Hill. See their website at: http://www.hotelleger.com/ The gorgeous Autumn Devich, manager of the Hotel Leger, is preparing for my follow-up story of this very historic hotel. The Leger once was a courthouse, jail and even had a place out back to hang criminals. With this follow-up, I get to spend the whole night in Room 7, George Leger's room (one of the most haunted rooms in the hotel) by myself, while paranormal investigators/scouts Shannon 'Ms. Macabre' McCabe - President of HPI, Chris Grissom - Technician and Tim Hawkins - Lead Investigator of Group B. They will be staying in Room 11, the second most haunted room. Chris only gets to stay for a little while, because he has to work the following day. Autumn set us up with an awesome price for our hotel rooms, they are FREE! Thank you Autumn, you are the best! Will I find my Room ""1408""? Hmmm…let's see... I love this gold mining town that was founded in 1848. I hope to encounter George Leger's ghost or the Lady in White ghost that haunt this hotel. George is known to hang out at the saloon and some of the rooms. There even have been noises of ghostly children too, so let's see how this investigation goes!

First off, I got my vehicle the 'Ghost Tracker' filled up with some prime gas and picked up Shannon, Tim and Chris. It was a treat for Shannon, Tim and Chris to ride in this jazzy sportscar and I threw on the theme to X-Files for them. Of course, they were all complaining on how cramped they felt in my car and I sort of tuned out their complaints, so I could concentrate on the investigation tonight. As we arrived the lobby was filled with a great crowd of people playing pool, having drinks at the bar and enjoying the inside décor of this historic hotel. I introduced myself to the lovely bartender named Jennifer Sanders-Metzger, she has been working at this hotel for 3 years. Clairvoyance runs in her family and she is a clairvoyant herself. So the first thing she did was introduce herself to the entities of this hotel.

The entities have been known to toy with people in this establishment, they are sort of mischievous at times. One night when she was closing down the hotel, she saw from her peripheral vision figures of light moving around. Another time, she was setting up a plate setting and walked away. The manager told her to set the plate setting, because it hasn't been done. She knew she set the plate setting, but did it a second time. The second time around after she walked away, the plate setting was missing again. She did it a third time and asked the ghosts to stop playing these games and they finally stopped. Another time, these three kids were playing with their bouncy balls. The balls disappeared and were found later by the fireplace upstairs in one of the rooms, in the shape of a triangle. When Jennifer was closing down the beer room, she saw the bottom of a phantom dress swoosh by her, it was a light colored dress and she was quite startled from this partial apparition. Sometimes the entities will hold the door knob, while she is trying to open a door. Jennifer tells me that when a woman named Debbie actually lived downstairs in the hotel, she would tell George Leger - owner of the hotel to turn the heat on, because it was cold. When asking George Leger (George Leger was the owner of this establishment back in the 1800s - so he has been deceased for a long time) to turn on the heat, a blast of hot air swept the room. One time Debbie was cleaning up after a New Year's Party and the champagne bottles were mysteriously lined up at each hotel room door with party hats placed on top of the champagne bottles. This was done by some unseen entity.

As Jennifer started serving other customers with drinks, I noticed a smiling blonde at the end of the bar. I introduced myself to Trae Parker, a regular customer of this establishment. Trae tells me that she has lived two years in this town. She has seen phantom corpses hanging from the trees out back of the hotel. Trae is quite the character, she calls herself the princess of Mokelumne Hill and she is a 'sensitive'. When she called herself a princess, she had a sly grin on her face. She is able to talk on her portable telephone, because she lives about a block away from the hotel and brings her portable telephone to the bar. Her home is located at Spooky Hollow/China Gulch, which is next to the local cemetery. She tells me that her house is haunted. At times she has felt bound and trapped in her home and she can hear phantom footsteps throughout her house. There has been pictures removed from her house and at times she feels like a female angel follows her to protect her from other unseen forces. She tells me that she assisted police in the woodchipper murder of a woman named Cindy Vanderheim. She goes on to tell me that the population of Mokelumne Hill is 600, but they have 60, 000 people buried in this town. There is more dead, than living in this town, she proclaims. She has heard stories from guests of this hotel, where they say that blankets have been held around their bodies and they are unable to leave the bed due to the restriction from the held tight blankets.

This gold mining town was involved in the French/Chilean War, in which militia was called up to fight in this war. Sometimes up to 5 people a day were murdered on the streets of Mokelumne Hill. Bob Barnes, retired Colonel of the California State Military Reserve (US Army) confirms Trae's story.

I met another regular of this establishment, her name is Mary McCartney. She tells me she opened up a door, where the old jail was located and felt a cold breeze as soon as she opened the door. When this happened, she felt a fluttering on her chest. She goes on to elaborate that her ancestors are from this town. So just perhaps, some of her ancestors haunt this hotel and town too. She now lives in the old family home and she can feel the presence of her grandfather and other ancestors in her home. She also witnessed a bottle being knocked down in the bar area by an unseen force.

While I was making my interviews, Shannon, Chris and Tim were busy checking out various areas of the hotels, trying to gather EVPs and digital photos of anything that could be considered paranormal. Shannon makes contact with paranormal investigator/Vice President of HPI John Wachter, aka Vlawde. Vlawde is a lead investigator for Team A and they are conducting a residential haunting investigation this evening. Team A consists of John Wachter, Alicia Perry, Mary Casiano and Jennifer Baca. They are working on a home cleansing and to make the owners of this residence comfortable in their surroundings. On this night Team A and Team B in two different locations, are in constant communication via cellular phone to discuss any findings.

Cheri Garamendi, bartender of this establishment told me that she has felt strange things in this hotel too, but didn't elaborate because she was so busy waiting on customers at the bar. I learn that Cheri Garamendi is the relative of US Politician John Raymond Garamendi, who resides in this County. Samuel Andahl the dishwasher has heard things falling numerous times and when investigating, there was no one around to cause these objects to fall to the ground.

Finally it was getting late and it was time to head back to our rooms. This night we were equipped with two video cameras, 4 digital cameras, 3 electronic digital audio recorders and 1 Listen Up sound enhancer. I don't know all the results yet, so let's see what Shannon says in her FINDINGS and CONCLUSION part of this article.

Trae Parker came by my hotel room and as soon as she walked in she felt a heaviness on her chest. It bothered her so much, she had to immediately exit my room. I'm not a sensitive, so I didn't feel what she was feeling. In fact I fell asleep comfortably in my bed with warm quilts and soft pillows. About 3:06am, I heard footsteps approach my bed. There were 5 steps that seemed to come from the door towards my bed. At 4:16am, my bed vibrated slightly, then stopped. Now to debunk my own experience, perhaps the footstep sounds were not emanating from my room, but from an occupied room near my room, and perhaps the vibrating of my bed came from people walking outside of my room? I am not going to say that what I experienced was truly paranormal, just maybe it was something from my own half asleep groggy imagination. But, who can say what I experienced is real or not real? In the morning, I checked on Shannon and Tim. Shannon and Tim experienced absolutely nothing in their room.

As we left this historic hotel, I can see why people want to stop and see this hotel, this whole town is full of history. This hotel is the legacy of this town's history. In the morning, we cramped inside my vehicle the 'Ghost Tracker' and stopped off at the Odd Fellows Cemetery and Sutter Creek City Cemetery circa for both: 1854. I noticed when I left the Hotel Leger there were an unusual amount of chem trails in the sky. Chem trails that zig zagged, if I was an investigator for chem trails, I would have liked to looked into this unusual display more, but I had to get the Shannon and Tim home. We stopped off at Denny's in Jackson and talked about our investigation of the Hotel Leger.

I finally got everyone home and prepared for a scouting mission on this day Saturday, November 17, 2007. I thought about the email I received from Dana and Jennifer Mierkey, it read:

""I enjoyed reading your well done website. My daughter and I recently went to Hotel Leger in Mokelumne Hill ca. We not only got numerous orbs but a figure of a woman in an oval mirror in room eight an otherwise plain unremarkable room. To the naked eye there is no marks, nothing on the wall or the mirror but the little digital camera screen kept showing what looked like a star. My daughter Jennifer was drawn to the room again and again, she always feels them as do I. In one shot she is drawn directly to the wall, looking that way, feeling her but not seeing her or having a clue until we got home late that night and downloaded photos onto an old 50 inch screen TV. It was quite shocking to see a pretty obvious woman in the mirror. We got interested in this hotel after Jennifer attended a wedding there three weeks ago and came home with photos of orbs. While in one of the rooms with Becky her sister, Jennifer was standing near her, both getting ready for the wedding, the window slammed shut and the door creaked. Jennifer decided maybe she wouldn't spend the night, instead Becky and husband did but didn't comment on hearing or seeing things. There was one or two orbs in their room on the photos Jennifer took. I was very interested in the photos she had so I went with Jennifer and a young coworker of hers last Saturday. The downstairs room was a jail and prior to that a dungeon with a hanging tree out back. The town has an extremely violent past, I would say both Jennifer, myself and the young gal Dani that was with us feel the whole town is at unrest. After talking to a gal who works for the hotel and has always lived in Mokelumne Hill I felt our feeling were validated. The hotel worker said there is a balance of bad and good energy there through out the town and always has been. She states some nights it feels so thick she won't step outside. While taking pictures in the dark creepy basement-jail I silently asked anyone to step forward and the orbs were not only around the air they are on my clothing. Just recently one of the guest of the bridal party, a sister to the bride, Jennifer and I don't know her, we just heard the story she was terrified of a woman in the room. Finally after going through my oldest daughter who went through the bride then to the sister Tracy for the photo it was sent to Jennifer and myself and we were shocked to see her photo of room eight is exactly the same as ours, only difference was hers was shot during the middle of the night in the dark and ours in late afternoon before it got dark. She picked up the lady in the mirror too. It's quite clear on the big screen on our photo. Since you are into this kind of thing I thought you would find it interesting. I am not terribly computer proficient so am sending the third and fourth party email photo from the lady Tracy to you by doing a forward.

Through contacts via this first initial email, I invited HPI Paranormal Investigators-in-Training Dana and Jennifer on a scouting mission, they both showed up to my house. I briefed Dana and Jennifer on the email I received, it was in regard to a murder committed by serial killers Gerard and Charlene Gallegos:

""Hi again; her name was Virginia (Ginger) Mochel, she is my mom's little sister. She was 35 when it happened (In 1980, July, I think), I was just 13. She was a bartender at the Sail Inn/1522 W. Jefferson Blvd, West Sacramento and had just closed it for the night and had gotten into her car when Gallego came up to her car window and pointed a gun at her. He had been in the bar earlier that night and saw her. So just her car was left in the lot and she never came home, so the babysitter called police (She had a 4-year-old son, Glenn Mochel, and a 9-year-old girl, Michelle Rubalcava). They took her in their van and I understand after she was assaulted, was killed (Charlene testified that she was angry and defiant and told him to just kill her; also, I once read she wanted to call her children to say goodbye). They tied her up with fishing line, and when they found her some months later, detectives remembered that Charlene had told them they'd gone fishing that day (they were initially questioned in the missing-persons investigation). So that helped catch them. It was a horrendous and devastating thing for my mom to lose her little sister, and also, we were kept from the children by their father, who also was an early suspect. (They were divorced). So we lost that whole part of the family. It's been sad to see my mom go through that, but she hides a lot and seems very strong. Mostly I wish she could see the two children again and have them forgive us all for seeming not to contact them (the mail was returned by Michelle's father) Thank you again. I think she is in heaven too. I hope it's not just that I need to think that, but that she really is. Elizabeth ""

Dana and Jennifer were equipped with two electronic digital audio recorders for EVPs and two digital cameras. We jumped in the Ghost Tracker and headed off to the Old Historic Broadway Cemetery first. They have read about this cemetery and wanted to see the cemetery for themselves. I interviewed two ground workers Ashley Fortune and Andrew Pisansky of the NCCC Americorps. I asked them if they have witnessed anything paranormal at this cemetery and both said ""no"". We left the cemetery and went straight to the Sail Inn in West Sacramento. I used my Listen Up sound enhancer and tried to make contact with Virginia (Ginger) Mochel, while Dana and Jennifer tried to record EVPs and took pictures around this bar. We were undercover, because the bar was full with patrons and we didn't want to make it obvious. Due to the traffic noise and patrons talking, I was unable to establish any paranormal communication with Virginia. All of the photographs were normal and showed no signs of residual haunting activity. Jennifer did her own research on the Gallegos and said that Virginia was kidnapped at this site and taken 20 miles down the road and finally murdered. Due to this fact, the residual haunting activity would most likely extend from Sail Inn (Point A) to murder location 20 miles away (Point B). I decided the best time to actually investigate this site would be after the bar closed and there is less traffic. There is too much noise interference to conduct a good investigation. We left and since Dana and Jennifer traveled all the way from Lathop to conduct this preliminary scouting mission, I figured I better give them a fun scouting mission, so I decided to stop off at the house on 22nd and H Street. Both were excited, looking at the gargoyles of this old home, as they snapped pictures of this house, they were getting orb shots everywhere. Jennifer even got a picture of what looked like a white mist leaving the 2nd floor window. I was shocked to see so many people driving by the house, snapping pictures and discovered that people have been reading my past article about this house.

Case example, I interviewed Carrine Hansen and her mother Goria Hill, they read my article and had to see this house for themselves, they told me that they even read my I-5 Killer article about the murder site at I-5/Sutterville. (I took Dana and Jennifer to I-5/Sutterville too). I told Carrine and Goria that I will be taking Dana and Jennifer to Doreathea Puente's F Street Boarding House. Carrine asks ""can I follow you over there?"" I smiled and said ""more the merrier"". We stopped at the F Street Boarding House and there were crows flying all around this house, which made the house even more spookier. The 4 ladies that I brought over here, started snapping pictures and got some excellent orb pictures at this house. One of Jennifer's photos showed 8 orbs around the house. Coincidentally, there were 8 makeshift graves at this house. As they were taking pictures, Robert Gordon a neighbor to this house asked what we were doing. I told him that we were paranormal investigators and I was a journalist. With a smile on his face he took me over to his house. I met his lovely wife Karisten Lockhart and she told me about the paranormal activity in their own home. I asked them if I could conduct an investigation and they said ""yes"". Robert Gordon read the Sacramento News and Review account of my previous investigation of the F Street Boarding House and was impressed with the report, he was now ready to have an investigation of his own home. As I left Robert and Karisten, I gathered up Dana, Jennifer, Carrine and Goria and took them to the Sacramento Theater Company and from the pictures they took, they got some more orb shots at this G Street location. Finally Carrine and Goria headed home and Dana and Jennifer treated me to dinner at the Tower Café.

I debriefed them about the scouting mission and afterwards with a smile, I told them that the Tower Café is next to the Tower Theater, which is supposingly haunted. Jennifer snaps a few photos of the theater. As I thanked them for my dinner, I asked if they had a satisfying day of scouting and both were very pleased. They were both tired and now have a long drive back to Lathrop. I would say it was a fulfilling weekend of ghost hunting. Now let's find out what Shannon has to say about the Leger Hotel. Shannon, take it away!

FINDINGS: I still need to go over numerous hours of video and audio. I did not experience anything first hand, but who's to say there won't be an EVP or something on the video. Stay tuned.

SHANNON'S CONCLUSION: With all the stories from the Hotel Leger's staff I would give this place a 7 on the Spook Meter!

Evil Giggles,"Pennsylvania, United States",Apparitions / Voices / Touches,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Apparitions / Voices / Touches :: Evil Giggles

I t was a bright summer day, as always my Mom is outside calling me and my two older sisters to come out swimming (my Mom loves to swim), my Dad working on anything that he can get his hands on, and me who also loves to swim, but loves the computer more at times. I decided to take a brake from swimming and get online and check my mail and stuff... Well with me as with a lot of other people only saying that your going to be on the computer for 15 minutes, it turns out to be an hour and 15 minutes and you don't even mean to!

I was in my den (where my computer is) typing to friends when all the sudden I felt a chilling breeze pass by me, no windows were open and the door was shut. I stopped for a sec, then just went along typing. That's when I heard laughing! It wasn't like a little 5 year old small laugh, it was like an evil demonic giggle! It wasn't pleasant! I stopped typing again when it stopped. I looked around the room to see if I could find where the giggles where coming from. I just stopped and laughed at myself because now I am going crazy, I think I'm hearing demons laughing at me! If someone told you that, you would think they're crazy too! So I just didn't bother with it and started on typing again.

Well, not long after that I start to hear growls! No not dog growls like hissing, mad, evil, demonic-like growls! And this time it wasn't only growls, it was evil giggling to! Both giggles and growls only lasted a few seconds than went away for another secant and then came back! So I started to get scared I quickly got up and went over to see if I could fine where the sounds where coming from. As I followed them I found the growls and giggles where coming from the corner! Now I know that I was swimming half the day and I'm a little tired and all, but I know I'm not losing my mind! It stopped right away after I saw where it was coming from. After I stood there for a minute, I got another chill and just walked over to the computer, said bye to my friends and got the heck out of there!

I thought that was the weirdest thing, so a few days later I told my best friend (Sabina) about what happened and she said maybe I was hearing stuff, but I know I was not just hearing stuff! After a while I got started thinking if Sabina was right, maybe I was just hearing stuff. So I was truly believing I didn't hear anything, I was just tired. A few days later I was in my den on the computer (again) and I heard evil giggles again! So now I know I wasn't hearing things! After I heard the giggles I got out of there as fast as I could! After that I never heard the growls or giggles again.

My Beginning,"Indiana, United States",Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: My Beginning

M y Mom and Dad are pretty quiet about things that happen to us. They don't like to tell the stories because no one believes us anyway, except my great grandma. But she can't help us anymore because my grandma told her to stop feeding my imagination.

What I am about to tell you is going to sound crazy, but it happened to me. Mom tries to help, but she is basically clueless, even when things happen to her too. She walks around the house saying the Indian prayer to the Great Spirit and telling things not to harm us kids, but I don't think that is working.

When I was much younger, before my brother was born, we lived in a mobile home park and in our house, I had a bedroom in the front and my parents were in the back with a huge bathtub that I liked to play in. Mom would bless the bath water with lavender and fill it all the way up so I could play. No reason for that, great grandma just told her that should be done when ""cleansing"". One day I looked in the mirrors above the sinks and I saw a woman who looked very sad sitting on the back of the tub with her feet in the water. I remember turning around and only seeing the wall so I screamed at Mom to help. She grabbed me out of the tub and asked what was wrong, but I couldn't tell her.

This same woman was in my bathroom. I hated going in there. Mom and Dad made it a princess bathroom so that I would, but when I wanted to take a bath, the woman was laying in the tub. At times when I would go in there the whole room looked different. The walls would have carpeting on it all the way to the ceiling and the window was covered with a board. Sometimes I would see something red all over the toilet, sink and tub. It was a small bathroom, so everything was close together. Mom couldn't use it unless the door was left open, she never told me why.

My bedroom was the worst. The woman was there with a little girl. They would hug each other and sit on the window seat like they were watching for someone to come home, because they would jump up and run out of the room. They always seemed either scared or sad. At night something would come out of the closet. It was big because it would pull the door off the track and it would be hanging there when we all got up. I never saw it because when I would hear it coming I got out of there! I just started sleeping on the living room couch.

Lots of other things have happened in that house and others. Dad moved us out of there when Mom got pregnant with my brother because she had already lost three babies there. He said we needed a bigger place, but I think he saw things too. I caught him talking to Mom a couple of times before she even got home.

The Pot Wrapped in a Red Cloth,India,Misc,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Misc :: The Pot Wrapped in a Red Cloth

M y friend Himanshu Singh lives in power grid. In India, power grids are generally made at the graveyard because of lack of land. Daily, a security vehicle takes the round of the boundary at night to make sure there is no thief or something like that. One day in the same job, the driver and the other security guard saw a pot lying on the center of the road, wrapped in a red cloth. In Indian tradition, generally the soul is believed to be stored in such pots after the death of a person. The guards were superstitious and they thought to remove the pot from the road rather then crushing it. So one of them got down from the car and kept the pot aside. As soon as he again went to the car, he saw a lady running behind their car in white cloths, screaming in a shrill voice. The next day they told this incident to the manager and resigned their job.

One more incident, in power grid every year in the festival of Durga Puja, there used to be a statue of goddess Durga. As usual the guards were taking the round of the boundary. As soon as they reached near the graveyard, they heard screaming voices. They moved further and saw that demonesses were jumping out of such a high and large boundary. They were astonished and told this to the directors of the grid.

Paranormal Activity,"Virginia, United States",Poltergeists / Physical Manifestations,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Poltergeists / Physical Manifestations :: Paranormal Activity

I just wanted to share some things that have been going on my house with people that I knew would appreciate it. Before I start let me give you some background info. My family and I live in a very Historic Town in Central Virginia called Fredericksburg. It's really big on all of the civil war battles that happened in this area. We have lived here for over 10 years, and we've done some research on our property, although it was not a battlefield, soldiers from both sides camped out on our land on several different occasions. I believe that most of what goes on is due to poltergeist activity and not actual haunting's, but we have seen apparitions from time to time. Also, the people who owned the house before us, (the first owners) fought all the time and eventually got divorced, they left a lot of negative energy behind them when they left. Well, I have 10 years worth of experiences, but I'll try to highlight the main ones.

When we first moved in my dog refused to go in the basement, she barks and growls at the basement door at random times. One day when she was doing this, we heard a huge bang down there, it sounded like someone was throwing all of our unpacked boxes around, but when we went to investigate everything was as it should be. My dog won't go down there unless we make her, she terrified of it. The scary part about my dog barking is she's an Australian bark less dog, she never ever barks!

My mom is very musical, and she has a lot of instruments on our first floor. We hear her playing a lot when she isn't home. We've chalked it up to the walls releasing noise that they have absorbed but NEVER does it when she is around. Also the toilet in her bedroom will flush by itself when no one is up there.

Now comes the really creepy stuff... Our first floor is very open with the kitchen dining room and rec room just flowing into one another. One night we were watching TV and 2 lamps that hang on the wall in our breakfast nook flew off the wall. They didn't fall, it as if they were thrown, the cords were even yanked out of the wall. No one was in the kitchen but several people saw it happen.

One night a few months ago we were woken up in the middle of the night by all of our fire alarms going off. There was no fire, and the alarms we had didn't have a Carbon Monoxide tester. The batteries didn't need to be replaced either. After unhooking all of them from the wall and removing the batteries the alarms were still going strong. We had to wrap them in blankets and hide them in a closet in our basement so that we could go back to sleep.

My sister has seen a man in grey coat with only one arm walk through our backyard and then vanish at the property line, and when my nephew was 2, we were all in the back yard and he asked us why there was a man buried back there. When we asked him more questions about it he refused to answer, and started playing again.

One time when I was about 16, my mom and I were in the foyer fighting, full out screaming at each other, I don't even remember what it was about now. The chandelier above us started swinging back and forth really hard and 2 bulbs burst.

I have felt and seen an oppressive black shadowy figure in my room. I could move and speak when I saw it, but it frightened me so much that I didn't sleep in there until I put up protective measures. One if those measures I read about a while ago: You get glass orbs and paint the inside silver while whispering blessings over it. You then hang the orbs by every entrance to your room or home and they block out evil spirits. This actually worked until about a year ago... I felt the presence again and had to sleep on the couch, the next day when I went into my room the mounting and wires for the orbs were there but all of the orbs were missing. I never found them, they were just gone. I haven't been able to sleep in there much since, I stay at my boyfriend's or I sleep on the couch. The few times that I have stayed in there I have been plagued by horrible nightmares.

The only part that frightens me is the thing in my room. I will be completely awake when I see him. For some reason I keep wanting to call it 'him.' I don't know if most of this is poltergeist activity that my mom, my sisters, and I have created with our own energy but I know some of it we can't possibly be doing.

"Footsteps, House Settling,Touches, Tapping and Other Noises","California, United States",Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: Footsteps, House Settling,Touches, Tapping and Other Noises

I just moved into an apartment in August, due to a divorce... me AND my roommate have both had a ""third resident"" feeling ever since then. Though, his experiences are different from mine... I do have the master bedroom and I think that is where this ghost lived.

I have narrowed down the timeframe to roughly Midnight PT - 2:00AM PT. Before I noticed the activity between 1:00 am and 2:00 am. But since the winter time change, it has moved up an hour to 12:00AM to 1:00AM. Makes sense, if it is a residual haunting - the event will play back at the time it originally occurred, so the hour difference coincides with the haunting.

I can tell when it is ""there"" as I start to hear house settling noises, like the walls creaking. Or when someone walks, you can sometimes hear the house settling around them in response. Well, I hear that noise... But no one is around and my roommate is asleep on the other side of the apartment.

Last night, something sat on the edge of my bed. I felt the bed frame ""give"" a little bit. This happened 3 times. I also hear footsteps walking around the perimeter of my bed. Then they sometimes go into my bathroom which is adjoined to my room. I hear my vertical blinds tapping against each other some times. Like someone is trailing their hand across them all as they walk by. Not violent like, just light touches. I felt something touch my chin when I was laying in bed, on my back with the covers pulled up to my mouth. Like when a cat will gently paw your face... I felt something gently touch my chin through my covers.

I have heard things slump or bump in my closet, things that are neatly tucked away on shelves, that shouldn't move.

I heard a glass tip over in the sink the night before last (11/18/07) and immediately afterwards, the noises in my room started up.

I try not to be awake during these times (midnight - 2:00am), as they are very frightening, and I feel like a ""sitting duck"" every time it happens.

Sometime I hear someone leaning on my desk, or other little environmental disturbances. Pops, snaps, creaks, things like that.

This apartment building was built in 1981, so it isn't that old. The house settling noises ALWAYS occur at this time... And never any other time. I am very observant by nature, and like to determine a logical answer before I turn to this type of thing. But since day 1, me and my roomie have both said ""do you feel something here?"" and we both agreed ""yes, and I definitely can tell it is male"".

Dad is Home,"Louisiana, United States",Family / Friends Visits,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Family / Friends Visits :: Dad is Home

M y dad passed away in December of 2005. He was 67 and seemed very healthy considering he was a heavy smoker. When he was taken to the hospital, he told us he knew he wasn't coming home and that he had laid out the suit he was to be buried in along with his will. I told him he was being silly and that he would be home soon. At the hospital, the Drs. told us he had severe heart blockage and would require bypass surgery immediately if he stood a chance of surviving.

They performed the surgery and said it went well, but he never woke up from the surgery, he lived only 2 days after. A few weeks later, we were at my mother's house for Christmas, it was my husband and me, and our 2 sons, ages 12 and 6, my brother and his wife and his 4 children and my mother. My parents loved Christmas and still treated us as though we were children. There were just tons of presents in the living room and we sat down to pass out gifts. My sister in law and nephew were elected to play Santa as we call it and they have to wear Santa hats. I was taking their picture in front of the Christmas tree and in the curtain behind the tree you can see the perfect image of my dad's silhouette in the picture.

Since that night we can hear him upstairs walking around in his bedroom and his tv will come on and there is no one upstairs. I also have smelled smoke in the living room by his recliner where he watched tv and smoked after supper. My kids say when they spend the night with my mother that my dad tells them goodnight and then you can hear him going upstairs to bed. It scares them and they don't like to go over there anymore.

As time goes on more things are beginning to happen in the house. Dad was the only one that went upstairs and since his death we rarely go up there for any reason. On occasion we have went up there to go in the attic and his toilet will flush and no one is in there. Should I just let him be or is there anything I can do to help him move on?

Ghost in my House,"Illinois, United States",Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: Ghost in my House

T his story started a long time ago when we bought this house. My brother Keith was in his room sleeping when he woke up to a loud BANG. The closet door flew open and a heavy metal iron flew across the room. I didn't find out until I switched rooms with him about three years ago.

Ever since then, I hear weird noises at night and foot steps going around the house. A couple of days ago I was home alone and reading at the computer desk. My dog was sitting on the couch sleeping and then she woke up and perked her ears and looked at the stairs. At that time I heard the door to my room shut and people walking around up stairs. I was so scared that I stopped reading and called my friend and turned up the music really loud. I still heard noises.

About three weeks ago my sister was playing her violin and then the T.V. turned on by itself. One night my friend slept over and she said that she heard drawers opening and closing in the room next door. Then the same night, me and my friends heard the gate opening and closing all night! The window kept on rattling too! We were freaked out! When ever we told my mom or dad, they didn't believe us. They just told us that we were imagining things. My brother said that he could sense demons. He said that there was a wolf demon in the basement. When I have sleepovers in the basement I hear people walking around upstairs. My friends say that too! I don't know what it is so if you think you know what is going on in my house then please, tell me.

Now my Kids Sense It,"Indiana, United States",Children Who See Spirits,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Children Who See Spirits :: Now my Kids Sense It

A s all of you know or at least the ones that have been following the events in my new home, there has been things happening that I cannot explain or that I cannot decipher. After the last time the house had remained kind of quiet or at least so I had thought. That is until having a conversation with my son and daughter, I found out the opposite.

On Monday 11/19/07 I was getting ready to leave and go to work and as usual, I was running around trying to get the kids ready for school. Jacob is 7 and is in second grade and goes to a school close to home and Emilie is 4 and I have her in a private Christian school since it is less expensive than having her in a daycare and she is learning, so I like her being there. As you well know we are a christian family and believe in Jesus as our personal savior so my kids, although they have had their little happenings with ""Ghosts"", they say they are angels, at least my daughter says they are. They have never had any of them hurt them and actually they have helped them so the ones that I believe they see are the ""Guardian Angel"", just a small story:

I was in the garden and I was trying to get rid of weeds, when we got the house, it had a smell of cigarettes, the people that live there prior to us would smoke in the house and so of course the house had that smell penetrating in the walls and carpet. Later we had the carpets changed and walls painted with some stuff that kills the smoke smell and others and now that is gone, but at the time it was still there, so I had the windows open, including the ones in the upstairs and that is where the kids bedrooms are at. I was in the garden and something told me to look up and I see my daughter standing at the window with her head sticking out. My heart dropped, I thought she is going to fall and break her head. I told her ""Emilie, sweetie why don't you come down here with mommy and help me in the garden?"" I noticed that she looked back is if someone calling her and she looked back at me and then she moved away from the window. I figured she is coming down as I told her. When she got to where I was I said ""Emilie I don't want to see you looking out that window, you could fall and get hurt"" she looked at me and smile and said ""don't worry mommy, he already told me not to because I could get hurt so that is why I came down"", as if nothing, I said ""oh yea who is he?"" and she said ""oh silly mommie my angel"" and she got up and ran away. I was frozen!

So, that is why I say they are the ""guardian angels"" well, again back to the beginning, I was getting ready for work and I went upstairs to make sure my son had brushed his teeth and he looked at me and said ""mommie you know what happened to me?"" I said what? He says ""I was using the bathroom and flushed the toilet and put the toilet seat down and turned to brush my teeth. I felt as if someone was next to me, when I turned around the seat was up"" I looked at him and said ""are you sure?"" and he said ""yes, mom I even put it back down and when I turned again it was up"" I asked him if this was the only thing that had happened and he said no, he said that there has been other things happening and he has been hearing noises and steps and at times he wants to run down the stairs.

I sent him to bed on Sunday the day before this and he threw a fit and started crying, saying he was scared and he wanted to sleep with me. I always read the bible to them before they are put to sleep (out loud) and we pray as well. I really could not tell if he really was scared or just a tantrum so that he could go to bed with me.

I don't know guys! What do you guys think? I still can't seem to find any history on house or property.

Can anyone help me search for the background on the property or the house?

I Hated that House,"New York, United States",Misc,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Misc :: I Hated that House

I 've long given up on trying to deny the fact that my family seems to be haunted. Not our houses, not the cities in which we live, us. But this was the worst thing I had ever encountered. Back in fall 2001, my sister, mother, father, and I had just moved to Cumberland Gap in Tennessee. We lived in this really old white house. It had plants growing all over the place and the paint was all chipping, but aside from that it was a beautiful house. It was old fashioned and had two stories. There was a door coming out of the upstairs hallway that you could open and go out onto the hill outside. The house was completely infested with fleas, but we needed a place to live and we could afford it, so we just kept the air conditioner running as high as it could get and they didn't seem to bite as much.

The first day my sister and I were there, we had just come back from vacation with my grandparents, and our cat had had kittens. They had all died, but we just figured they crawled a bit and just didn't make it after that. It didn't seem odd at all that they were spread out across the house, but thinking about it now it kind of is. We were there a couple of days and my sister and I started school. It was a very small school, but our cousins went there too, so it didn't seem as hard. When I say small, I don't mean only a few teachers. There weren't classrooms. You know those wall type thingy pieces that are on wheels and you move around? The walls of ""classrooms"" were those. I could not find my way around at all unless I followed my classmates closely.

Again, I didn't think much at first that kids started whispering when the bus stopped at our house and it's probably nothing, but if they knew how creepy this place was, it would have been nice for a warning. My sister and I slept in our room a total of five nights in that house. Our room had a very creepy feeling to it and I just didn't like it at all. My sister, who is one of the bravest people I know, didn't like it either. We started sleeping in the living room, her on the couch and me on the floor. I had horrible nightmares every night in that house. There was a hole in the living room floor big enough for you to sink into if you stepped in it. I remember one night I was so scared, for some reason I can't remember, that I ran to my parents room and didn't even ask before I climbed into bed with them. I noticed that their room felt weird too.

Have you ever been in a very dark room and after a while, it looks like television fuzz looking at the wall or ceiling? I'm hoping it was that, but that night I could have sworn I saw little people crawling around.

I absolutely hate that house. We moved fairly quickly because my parents were getting bad feelings, too, and my dad is not the kind of person to believe in anything remotely ghost-like. Do you think it was haunted or are we just paranoid?

Cornflakes & Flour,Australia,Misc,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Misc :: Cornflakes & Flour

T his didn't happen to me, but one of my mum's best mates daughter. Tthis happened in Cygnet, Tasmania (Australia). This girl (Jenny) was in bed one night and heard these noises out in the lounge-room, so Jenny went out to have a look but there was nothing there. She lived with only her mum, but her mum was still sound asleep in bed.

The next few nights, the same thing was happening, but still nobody there. Jenny told her mum, but her mum thought she was just imagining it.

So that night before she went to bed, Jenny got out a box of cornflakes and a bag of flour, she spread them all over the lounge room where she was hearing the noises. As she was laying in bed, she heard a crunch, crunch (the cornflakes).

She was to scared to go out and check so she waited until morning. When she walked out, the cornflakes were all broken up, there was footprints (bare feet) printed in the in the flour. The strange thing was the footprints started in the middle of the room and ended in the middle of the room. There was no way these footprints could be her or her mum because they didn't start or end anywhere.

After that the noises stopped and everything went back to normal, but she still has nightmares about it now.

The Block House,"Tennessee, United States",Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: The Block House

F irst, let me start off by giving you a little history. I grew up on a fairly good sized family farm. Several of the children built homes surrounding the main house and raised families of their own. In the late fifties, my older brother built the blockhouse right beside the main house. He lived there several years before building a larger house further away. Being recently divorced and now single, I moved into the blockhouse in the late eighties or early nineties. The blockhouse consisted of three rooms. As you entered the front door you would be in the main room which was a living/dining room to the right of that you had a very small kitchen and further to the right was a small bedroom. Being right beside the main house there was no need for a bathroom and none of the interior doors had actual doors.

Now in most stories it takes a while before things start happening, right? WRONG! It started my first night there. Like I said I was single again and didn't need much furniture. All the furniture I had to start was a bed, table, one easy chair and a T.V. (you have to have a T.V.)

My first night there I watched T.V. until about midnight and then went to bed. From the angle my bed sat you could look out the bedroom door through the kitchen and into the living room. I lay there for a while trying to sleep and for whatever reason opened my eyes and looked toward the living room and saw a bright reddish orange glow. Thinking maybe the house was on fire I jumped up and ran to the living room. Now remember this was a very small house and it only took a few seconds to make it to the living room and when I got there, nothing. No fire, no glow, nothing. Well I lay back down and tried to sleep and I guess I dozed off for a while because when I woke up the glow was back. I got up and went into the living room and it was gone again. I sat down in my easy chair and stayed up the rest of the night.

I asked my brother about it the next day and all he said was to not be surprised at what you might see or hear in that house. Over the four or five years I lived in that house, I heard many things, too many to count, but I will tell two that stand out in my memory.

This first incident happened several times, but the most memorable was after my nephew Lee moved in with me. Lee had his bed set up in the far left hand corner of the living room. One night we were watching T.V., I, in my easy chair, and Lee stretched out on his bed. I got up to go to the kitchen for another cup of coffee (I have always been a big coffee drinker), as I took a step something underneath the floorboards pecked where my foot was, another step another peck, each step I took I got another peck. The pecks weren't very loud, you could barely hear them over the television but your could feel them on the bottom of your feet. Well I got my coffee and came and sat back down. The pecks followed me all the way to and from the kitchen. Just to see if it would happen again I told Lee that I had some cokes in the fridge and that he could have some if he wanted it. Lee started in the kitchen and the same thing happened to him. Step-peck step-peck. He looked at me all wild eyed and exclaimed ""what in the hell in going on"" I just grinned, Lee knew about the house too, but I think this was the first time he had experienced anything.

The second incident happened some time later. It was winter time and me and Lee was watching T.V. We had the door closed and a fire going in the old warm morning stove. Right in the middle of our show there was a rap on the front door followed by two or three more. It sounded like they were knocking on the glass of the inner door. Well, I jumped up and ran to the door thinking something had happened to momma in the main house and that they might need help getting her up out of the floor or something.

When I got to the door, no one was there. I went and sat back down and Lee asked who was at the door, I told him no one. He then asked if I had seen anyone running away and I said no one knocked on the door because the outside screen door was locked. We had a old fashioned screen door, not a storm door, and it was impossible to knock on the inside door without opening the screen door. Lee looked at me and grinned kind of sheepish like and said ""We ain't going to get much sleep tonight are we?""

I moved out of the blockhouse in the mid nineties. It has sat empty for several years but has now been renovated and has had a bathroom added. My daughter is making plans to move into it. I wonder how long that will last.

Psychic Experiences,Philippines,Psychic / Medium,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Psychic / Medium :: Psychic Experiences

W here should I start? I used to sort of know that things are going to happen. But these thoughts only came when I least expected it. When I try to think about it, nothing pops up. I can't really tell when I'm going to have these thoughts next. It just comes.

When I was in elementary, I was left alone with my grandmother and the house helps. They were somewhere in the house while I and my ""lola"" (Filipino term for grandma) were in the living room. We seldom went to our grandparents' house because we live 3 hours away so I had no clue of what my grandma's health condition was or what kinds of medicine she was taking. I was looking at the picture frames when suddenly I had this really bad feeling. It just felt really weird. I turned to look at my grandma and suddenly she fainted. I called the maids to help me with her. She was already ok when my parents arrived. I did not mind that incident much. I was young.

Things continued to happen and as I have said I have no idea when these thoughts and feelings come, they just do. Now for the encounters with otherworldly beings. Bear in mind that after each incident I try my best to rationalize things, just to ease my mind.

Years ago, I was part of a Secondary Schools Press Conference which was held at Tacloban (Philippines). As part of the opening ceremony, there was a parade to round the vicinity. We passed by this church (I don't know the name). I looked at it and noticed a black (no face could be seen) hooded figure inside the bell tower from one of its windows. I kept thinking ""Do priests still wear robes like these until now? If so, why is he wearing black? That's supposed to be brown..."" Then we passed by this tree thus blocking my view of the tower. A few steps further and I saw the tower again. The figure was gone. I tried not thinking about it.

Then I went to college. That was when things started to get freaky. At my first dorm, I'd stay up until around 3-4 am doing my plates since I am an architecture student. There was this one time that I had to go to the bathroom. I was looking at the mirror which reflected part of the toilet cubicles behind. There was this dipper on top of the water closet. It started moving left and right, its handle hitting the wall thus making noise. I saw this from the mirror. I was scared but I wasn't able to shout or run. Instead, I slowly turned and fully opened the cubicle door. It stopped. I quickly walked towards my room went on with my plates very bothered.

Stuff like falling objects from my bed or my desk without reason continued to happen.

At my upperclassmen dorm, this was where I experienced my recent encounters. Once again I had to work late for a major plate. I decided to work at the multi-purpose area since I got sleepy whenever I work in my room. It was already around 3:30 am. I was alone. I was trying to make my scale model. I suddenly heard this scratching sound at the corner of the room where there was a pile of old stuff. Scared, I still had to go on since I had to submit that plate that very day. I tried to ignore it thinking it was only a cat (yes, we have cats in the dorm). I tried playing the radio really loud but the noise was still there so I put on my earphones and turned up to full volume (it hurt my ears but I was scared!). Suddenly, the song I was listening to stopped. A cold female voice started saying ""Kat"" slowly. I had goose bumps all over my body! I ran towards my room upstairs and asked my roommate to accompany me to get my things downstairs. I did not finish my plate. I passed it as is. I was too bothered to continue making it. To this day I still have the shivers when I think about it.

There's still a lot more. I hope you could somehow relate to what I have shared with you.

The Black Mirror Ghost,"California, United States",Apparitions / Voices / Touches,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Apparitions / Voices / Touches :: The Black Mirror Ghost

T oday I am writing this on the account that I have in fact seen a ghost, if I had taken a picture and was able to post it along with this story, I would, and please if you do not believe me then do not mock me, I am posting this story because I need help! About a few months ago, I was staying up late due to a party I had earlier and the caffeine from soda had finally kicked in and I wasn't tired. After hours of sitting in my room and entertaining myself, I needed to go to the bathroom. After 'taking care of' my business I opened the bathroom door and stepped out, my house has a lot of mirrors, one wall length in the bathroom and one vanity mirror right outside the door and next to my bedroom, so if you were to open the door, the first thing you would see is your reflection.

However, it was not me in the mirror, at least when I turned the light off, I looked back from the switch to the mirror, everything behind me was dark, nothing but shadows, my bedroom door was open and let light shine in the hall, I froze in the threshhold of the bathroom doorway, afraid to move. A girl I did not know was staring at me, an evil look on her face, I slowly took a step towards my bedroom, trying not to look at the mirror, unfortunately I have an insatiable curiosity and did not look away.

After making it into my room, I thought maybe it was my mind playing tricks on me. I turned my PC off and then my light, I ran to my bed and hopped in. I hated what I saw next, she was in my bedroom mirror and had a full length view of her. She smiled at me, not kindly though, after three hours of thinking it was just my imagination, it's too wild for me sometimes, I started to doze off, before I was completely asleep, I felt a sharp pain in my chest and sprung awake. The girl was at bed side, I thought I was dreaming but when I woke up the next morning I had a round scar where I felt the pain.

Please help me, I can't turn to family sinec I'm the only one who has seen her and the fact that I have disorders, none of which have to do with being crazy, but if I were to tell them, they would think I'm trying to draw attention to myself and scold me, every month it gets worse and I'm now afraid to be alone in a room with a mirror or have to turn on a light in a dark room that has a mirror in it. I've never been so scared before, and it takes a lot to scare me - so please if you have any advise let me know!

The Grave Yard Boy,"California, United States",Misc,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Misc :: The Grave Yard Boy

A bout 3 years ago, I was visiting my Great uncle's grave, I was leaving him his favorite flowers and an american flag. I stood there for a while, talking to his tombstone, hoping he would know I was still visiting. I had only met him once but I admired him and wouldn't forget him. A lot of people think he died in war, he didn't - only of natural causes.

It began to rain, I love the rain but still wanted a jacket since I was wearing a thin shirt. After about two minutes my shoulders were becoming visible through the shirt, suddenly feeling dry and warm, I looked up to see a boy smiling at me, he told me I would catch cold if I stood in rain like that, so I accepted his gesture.

After I had finished my visit, we walked back to the gate together, he offered to walk me back to my grandparents since he was afraid I would be hurt if I were walking alone.

After an hour of walking my mom drove up near us and motioned me to the car, she said she was just about to come and get me, I tried to give the boy his jacket back, he rejected me, waved goodbye and walked off, I entered the car and drove home with my mom.

The next day I was cleaning my clothes when I came across his jacket. I decided to wash it and return it to him, I checked the pockets of the jacket and found and address written on it. After washing it I headed to the street that was on the paper, only a one lane road and one house.

I knocked on the door, after a few seconds a woman opened the door, I smiled and told her that her son had loaned me his jacket last night and that I wanted to give it back to him. She broke out in tears and looked down at me enraged. She scolded me and thought I was mocking her, I told her I didn't know what she meant. She burst out crying even harder, she looked at me this time with happiness.

I was shocked at what she told me next, she said her son died a year ago yesterday and he couldn't possibly have given me his jacket, but what she said after that was even weirder, it was the jacket he wore the night he died. I ended up keeping the jacket and going back home to Cali, it's now my favorite jacket, occasionally I see the boy. He follows me around when I'm in Indiana, I've also gotten into more trouble after that, more near death experiences, and even when I was flying back to Indiana last week and our plane almost crashed, we were in Indiana air at the time and I was asleep when turbulence happened, I woke and next to me in the empty seat was the boy, his hand on mine, after a minute or so we regained altitude and everything was okay, after regaining altitude though, he was gone.

That night when I was using my mom's laptop in the basement while I watched my baby cousin Gerrit he appeared, he smiled and kissed my forehead and left again.

He always appears when I'm in indiana and places a hand on mine before disappearing, so tell me, do you think this ghost is just following me or something...

Something Evil in my Aunt's House,"Colorado, United States",Poltergeists / Physical Manifestations,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Poltergeists / Physical Manifestations :: Something Evil in my Aunt's House

W hen I was 15, we lost our home and had to move in with my aunt. It was definitely a full house. A lot of cousins along with my grandmother, my brother and myself all living together. I started noticing a lot of strange things almost immediately after staying there. Doors opening and closing on their own, footsteps moving up and down the stairs at night etc.

However, the most memorable to me took place one afternoon while I was downstairs in the den area. There were only 2 bedrooms downstairs, one at the bottom of the staircase and the other at the end of the hallway, in front of the den. I was in the den with my cousin Mark, his girlfriend and her 2 kids, and my other 2 cousins Kia and Tawana. Except for my aunt who was upstairs asleep, we were the only ones in the house. We were playing cards and listening to the stereo that was in Mark's room (the room in front of the den) when out of nowhere, we all heard a loud crashing sound stopping the music. Everyone jumped up in shock. Mark and I started to head for his bedroom when his girlfriend yelled out ""who was that""! Everyone looked towards the room at the bottom of the stairs but nobody was there. She said that when we all got up after the loud noise she had seen someone walk out of that room and up the stairs. No one else had seen it but we all split up with Mark and I going into his room, while the girls went to check the upstairs. When we got into his room we were in total shock when we saw his stereo. It was on the floor and it had a big dent in the back of it, as if someone had hit it or something. It had been in the same spot for years and had never fallen or been moved before.

Just a few moments after our discovery, the girls came back downstairs also in shock. They told us that my aunt was still deep in her sleep, and that no one else was in the house. None of us could explain what had just happened. That was the most interesting thing to have happened to me while staying there. I haven't been there in a few years but my aunt still lives there. Maybe one day I'll go back to visit and see if there is still any activity.

I really enjoy this site because it gives me the opportunity to share my experiences with others who have had the same experiences as myself. At least all of you listen with open minds. Thank You All.

The Black Lady of Sitio Bungol,Philippines,Apparitions / Voices / Touches,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Apparitions / Voices / Touches :: The Black Lady of Sitio Bungol

I t was the third week of summer when me and my two friends, Drew and Josh, decided to take a break from our usual days. By the way, we are a three-man, struggling, hopeful band trying to make it in the scene. Our destination was my Uncle Jun's house situated in a small village called Sitio Bungol, 100 kilometers away from the town of San Miguel, Iloilo, Philippines. It has a small population and almost every people know each other.

The way to Sitio Bungol was a stir. The rocky roads and the dusty wind almost rubbed my friends' patience out. But, when we arrived, their moods suddenly shifted the time they'd laid their eyes to my cousin Catherine. She was indeed charming and really pretty. She had two cute dimples that most men in their place admired her of. We've been friends for ten years and knowing my friends, especially Drew who always fall in love in every woman she meet, I told them that they mustn't laid even a finger on her. Well, it was in a humorous way because I know they're no trouble. We are so very close cousins and because she was just seventeen, sometimes I could not avoid being overprotected.

Uncle Jun, Harold, the eight-year-old brother of Catherine and Aunt Theresa, his wife, arrived when the sun was about to sleep and were so excited to see me after several years. He was working in the city as a security guard and my Aunt was out with Harold for grocery when we came. I told them that we'll be staying for two weeks for our vacation. The house was made of mostly lumber and plywood; and was a bungalow with three rooms. We stayed in Harold's room which spacious enough to accommodate us three. Harold stayed with Catherine in the other room.

One of the reasons why I took on vacation was to mend a broken heart. My girlfriend and I broke up then because she got pregnant by someone she had met in a night out. The two-year relationship ended a day before our trip. So, I really need a quiet place back then for me to ease my pain.

A serene view that only the province could give was a great place to start with. After supper that night, we spent our time with Catherine in a small house made by my uncle purposely for resting from an all-day works. It was situated just a few steps from the house. Catherine was a storyteller and whenever I'm with her, there was never a dull moment. That's the reason why Josh and Drew did got along easily with her.

The night has gone deeper without us knowing and Uncle Jun and aunt Theresa was asleep. The next thing we knew was we were very tired. Though sleepy, Catherine insisted that we talk still. Drew and Josh called it a night. They've gone to our room and took their rest. Maybe my dear cousin really missed me a lot. And I did, too. I keep no secret with her and so I told her about my heartache. She was

so pissed off with my girlfriend, well, my ex-girlfriend. We both decided to sleep there and never bothered to go inside the house. She got us pillows and a blanket.

But we did not finish it off yet. We're still awake until four in the morning talking about her interests, love stories and escapade. Talking about being a teenager, sure she got a lot of those. Before we finally dozed off she told me that starting tomorrow, she would find me a girl so I could move on. Knowing her, it would be a one hell of a search. She would not stop until she do so. But I just laughed it off.

The next day, Josh, Drew and me took ourselves out for a stroll in the fields. We got so wired up with a new found 'playground' that before we realize, we could not find our way back. But then, we took no anguish about it. We continued to fool around. Singing some head banging songs, throwing fruits, which fell from trees around, at each other; and tiring ourselves with senseless talks. Yet, soon enough, we still did worry about our way back.

Drew was being stubborn again. He kept on taking the blame on us. I could see that he was scared though he tried to deny it. While Josh, being the eldest among us, kept his wit. I know he was trying to figure something to take us out from an awkward situation. I was feeling a little nerve that time. I'd never been in such a situation. Who wouldn't, in the middle of somewhere? The sun was high and it's giving me an itch because I wasn't able to take a bath that morning. On our way, we came into a river bank. The water was green. Maybe because of the trees and shrubs that surround it. We decided to take a look of it as if that was the first time we'd seen a river. Again we forgot we were lost.

Drew and Josh were so fond of the mudfishes jumping out of the water and even had the butt to throw stones at them. Meanwhile, adept into boredom, I preferred to walk. As if trying to cater myself of the notion that some things existed beyond mankind's reach. And so, I 'investigate'. Yes, I do believe in paranormal. I even did practiced witchcraft and everything in between the matter. But I wasn't able to dig deeper into it for some reasons that I couldn't disregard. The thing is, I am a clairvoyant. I've been seeing things, I mean images, occurrences and even felt some presence which I couldn't understand. That's why I don't disembody the fact that there was really the 'other' world. Believe it or not - they do exist.

But I don't talk about it. Even with Josh and Drew. Well, except Catherine. But she just shrugged that off. I don't really give a damn about me seeing the 'others'. I took no account for it. For me, it was just another secret that comes with our existence. And maybe science had an ounce of influence the way my mind deals with paranormal matters. And so, I did 'investigate' but nothing happened. Thought I was just wasting my time. I turn around to go back. I heard Josh calling my name. I turned around to answer Josh's call and there they were standing almost annoyed with Catherine. I don't know how she found us. Besides, I never dared to ask.

On our way home, Catherine was so anxious to tell that she had found someone who she thought would be good for me as a girlfriend. All I did was to rolled my eyes and laughed. I met Xonia, the girl that Catherine was telling me about. She was the vice president of the youth council in their town. She was indeed beautiful and easy to be with. We had good times together. She tour me around the village and it felt like I'd found a rest from the world's distress. Somehow I've got peace of mind.

It was dark when we both decided to go back. I took Xonia to her place and soon trailed my way home. The path was dark and I really had hard time to make it even I had my cell phone used to light my way. I know my uncle Jun was looking for me by that time so I hurried my course. The rice field was half-bloomed and still smelled like pesticides. I crossed over the farm banks while singing some songs in my head just to ease myself because it felt like there's something eerie in the air.

My heart begun to pump fast and I felt chills in every part of my body. Though I don't see any thing, the cold breeze shuddered me.

Not for long, I felt like my head was spinning and my face begun to tighten up. With all the knowledge I learned from books and elders' mouths, what was happening to me that moment was a sign that an entity was present.

I wanted to run but I could not even take a single step. I tried to compose myself, I took a deep breath and run as fast as I could.

I came upon an acacia tree which was nesting in the middle of the field and when I was an inch to it, my chest palpated heavily. As if I was running out of breath. My entire body was almost bathed with sweat and my head was swirling.

I kept on running, away from the tree because I felt like there was a weird presence in the acacia. Soon, I started to vomit. It was a bitter and smelly liquid. I kept my mind clear in order for me to find my way back home. I took a glance at the acacia tree when I was far enough. And it gave the worst shudder I never had before. There she was, a figure of a lady in black with only her white eyes that I could be certain of, standing under the tree. More that scared me was her long hair, scattered as if was struck by lightning.

I arrived in the house when they were half-way of supper. Uncle Jun, just like the others in the table was surprised to see me in sweat and mud. Nobody has tried to utter a word but there was a big question mark on their faces the way they stare. On that very evening, Drew, Josh and me got the time to talk. I told them what happened. But then, Drew, careless as he always, was more interested with Me and Xonia thing. Josh was bothered though. Somehow me and him got the same thoughts on matters. I did told Catherine about it, too. Contrary to my expectation about her, she did listen to a weird story. Well, according to her, ghost stories are just a waste of time. She rather talk about her girly escapades. But, I could see her face turned white and she became restless. She then took the place beside me and wrapped her arms around my waist. I know, she's silently freaking out. As if something was really scaring her. Josh was, without doubt, bothered.

That night, I wasn't able to sleep. The figure of the black lady kept on disturbing my mind. Sure, I've seen some ghosts before, heard some frightening sounds and had encountered abnormal occurrences, but that one was beyond my grasp. I could see her white eyes every time I close mine.

The first week was a no fun for me but I didn't wanted my weird troubles ruin my vacation. And so, I tried to shove the black lady thing but her image keeps on running in my thoughts as of this moment. Though it's not every night, she still haunting me in my dreams. Don't know the story behind her apparition. Even Catherine knows nothing. She really wanted to hurt me in my sleep.

Was It Sascha?,"Colorado, United States",Family / Friends Visits,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Family / Friends Visits :: Was It Sascha?

I t was a few days after my best friend Sascha passed away, when I was at my friend Ryan's house. I was hoping to lose some of the stress there. We had been sitting in his room talking about Sascha for hours, trying to remember all the good times that we all shared together. During our talk, Ryan excused himself to use the bathroom. There were 2 bathrooms in the house, but at that time only the one upstairs was working. It was only the 2 of us in the house. While Ryan was upstairs, I laid back on his water bed with my legs hanging over the side.

I started to feel sad again so I decide to talk to to my friend Sascha. I remember telling him that I missed him a lot, when out of nowhere my right leg shot forward as if someone had pulled it. It took less than a second for me to jump up to see what happened. I was expecting to have seen Ryan but he wasn't there. I got up and went to check his closet for him, but he wasn't there either. That's when I heard the toilet flushing upstairs. When Ryan came back down I asked him if he was playing around and of course he said no. I consider myself to be a man of logic, but I also know that when I am unable to explain something that it could be of the paranormal. I am a firm believer in this. Thank You All.

I Am Confused,Turkey,Psychic / Medium,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Psychic / Medium :: I Am Confused

I am writing this story to ask you guys what you think. I am 19 years old and since I can remember, I have felt there's definitely something there. I say this because I have not felt like it was a threat or something I should be bothered about (sorry guys if my english is bad I have been studying turkish fully for 3 years).

When my gran died, these feelings became stronger. I could feel her there with me, beside me I would feel a hand on my shoulder or a sudden rush of cold sweep over me, but it felt good, I would feel protected, I knew she was there. Then one day came a real shock, I was sent to bed early, I can't remember why mum was at work and dad was looking after us. I hated my dad, he abused us for many years, I was crying my eyes out when I noticed in the corner of the room opposite my bed a lady sitting, rocking. She didn't seem like a threat, she was just rocking, watching me. I shut my eyes hoping not see it and when I opened my eyes it was gone.

A couple of years later my mum finally decided to leave my dad and as we were packing up our stuff, I came across old family photos, one of them stunned me, the photo was of a lady on a rocking chair outside an old irish cottage. The lady was the one I saw that night years ago. I asked my mum who she was. The photo must be 80-90 years old, my mum wasn't sure, she was definitely my mum's great gran but from which side of her family she doesn't know. I told her I saw her one night briefly when I was young, she believed me because the reason she has the photo is because she too was haunted by this lady on many occasions and a family member gave her the photo to verify who she was. Another occasion, before I was due to dance at the world championships in belfast 2001, my mum and sister were in the main bedroom, I was downstairs with my brother, all of a sudden my stereo started blasting. I ran upstairs and switched it off, we were shocked, how could my stereo switch itself on, turn up its volume and play the 21st track REACH FOR THE STARS by S club 7. My mum convinced me it was someone from the other side letting me know before the competition to reach for the stars, to try my hardest and don't doubt myself.

I had other experiences during that period as well, but I won't bore you guys. After my mum left my dad, I had the biggest teenage tantrum for years, so I completely forgot about everything but now that I have my life back on track, I have started noticing things again, but it seems I am more in tune with these happenings then normal. On about 5 different occasions, in the last 6 months, I have been able to tell when something bad will happen, something totally unexpected, like the death of my husband's uncle. I told my husband the night before I felt something bad was going to happen, I couldn't say what but something was giving me this feeling that something bad was going to occur, it did 6 hours later, my husbands uncle passed away.

On another occasion, out of the blue one day, I got all emotional, I felt I was going to lose my mum, I was hysterical for no reason (I live in turkey, my mum lives in the uk) then I got it into my head she was trying to kill herself, I was sure that's what she was doing. Days later my mum called, she was fine. 1 month later she came to visit, she told me one month before she took pills and vodka and tried to end her life. I wasn't sure why I was shocked!

Then one night, we were out in the town and I burst out, I felt like there will be an earthquake, I don't no why, it just came over me. Everyone laughed but the next day I was right there was a massive earthquake in japan 7.8. Another time I was at home and all of a sudden I felt depressed, I felt something was going to happen, but I couldn't stop it. The next day, 20 soldiers were killed in an accident.

When my mum came to stay 2 months ago, she told me she felt someone was in my home. One night she got completely hysterical she said there was a women standing over me all the time. I got angry and told my mum to leave.

New Apartment Adventures,"Virginia, United States",Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: New Apartment Adventures

N ow that I got the old apartment out of the way , it's time for the events in my current apartment. Just under 2 years ago, we moved from the old building to another old building less than a mile away (same zip code). My end of town is old as I somewhat explained before; the Oceanview section of Norfolk, VA. Many places down here are 50-100+ years old (or older), the area is full of history, some of it dark and unsettling.

From the very first second I walked into the new place, I knew it was an old school. It's a solid concrete and brick structure that you can tell the original building had been added to at some later date, increasing it to 3 floors. Later I found out, yes in fact is was the Old Oceanview Elementary that had been replaced sometime in the 1940's with a new building a mile down the street. Since the beginning, I knew something ""else"" was in the building. Living in so many paranormally enhanced places makes you attuned to the stuff after awhile.

Within the first week of moving in, I sat alone in the living room and heard the sound of children laughing. Not normally am alarming thing, but it came from directly in front of me, in the middle of my living room. I still am not sure if it was from outside, upstairs or what, but it was slightly disturbing. A friend who visited shortly after also reported she felt a hand grab her hand as she walked into the apt, she said it felt small, like a child's.

A few months later, I was home alone again, but getting ready to head out. Allow me to give you a bit of a layout. The apt is laid out in an H shape, with a long living room space, which leads through an archway into the kitchen-hallway area. That narrows down to a hallway with a pantry on the left and the bathroom on the right just before the bedroom door. The bedroom, 12x14, is isolated from the rest of the place. You cannot hear anyone knocking on the front door from the bedroom. The building is made of brick, concrete, with plaster walls and a wooden raised floor. Technically the ground floor is below ground level.

I was in the bathroom, just getting out of the shower. I had the bathroom door wide open, it blocks the hallway otherwise, and in the kitchen-hall section was a large dresser with a 45 gallon fish tank. In the reflection of the tank you could see into the kitchen. As I flipped my head down to wrap my hair, I looked into the fish tank and saw a tall male standing in the kitchen. I quickly stood up and ran out, checking the kitchen, but no one but the cat and myself in the apartment. I went back to the bathroom to see if I could figure it out, but I never could and never again saw the figure standing in the kitchen like that.

Several more months later, my boyfriend, myself and the cat were in the living area end of the apt. All the lights were off in the other end and everybody, including the cat, was off the floor, sitting down. Suddenly I heard a noise from the other end of the apt like the sound of a foot dragging across the carpeted floor. Very recognizable. I looked at my boyfriend who was looking at me - neither of us knew what made that sound. The cat acted off all evening, following us closely and refusing to stay in a room by herself.

Two days later, the sound repeated but this time we; BF, myself and cat, were in the bedroom and off the floor and the other end of the apt was dark and sealed up. Again the foot scraping the carpet sound, as clear as day. We haven't heard this sound again and never found a explanation for it.

About this time we started leaving a light on in the front part of the apt at night (we are both grown adults, 27 and 31) but something gave us the creeps: the archway leading between the two sections of the apt. If you sat in the bedroom and the living room was dark, you will get completely un-nerved looking into the darkness of the archway. My boyfriend, several friends, and myself all felt this. If you sat in the living room and looked into the darkened hallway-bedroom, you don't feel anything. Also at this time, my boyfriend and myself started getting strange ""I'm not alone"" feelings if you were in the bedroom, but alone in the house. Several times I would get up and go looking into the living room to see if my boyfriend had come home, only to find the place locked up and empty. I swore it felt like another person had come into the house and as you can't hear the front room from the bedroom, I really did think he had. He later told me he had the same experiences if he was home alone.

A few more major creepy events. First, as I explained before, if the bathroom door is open, but not wide open, it blocks the hallway. One night my boyfriend was using the loo and I was in the bedroom with my cat, watching TV. I got up, turned off the TV and left the room, closing the bathroom door just enough to get by. My cat was right on my heels (Yes, she often follows me just like a dog would). We sat down and started watching TV in the living room. A few minutes later my boyfriend joins us and asked me if I passed by twice. ""No, why?"" He stated that just before I walked by the door, out of the corner of his eye he saw a pale female leg pass by the door. I told him that I would have had to move the door to pass, plus the cat was with me and if I passed twice, he would have seen me 3 times, not just twice. He doesn't know what he saw that night.

The very next night, he was in the bathroom shaving and I was standing the in the hallway, with the door open, blocking the hallway. I was talking to him and out of the corner of the my eye, I saw a pale white, sharp clawed female hand wrap around the doorknob then pull back around. I stopped in mid-word and the boyfriend asked what I saw. I told him and he looked past the door - nothing there.

The last straw was the dreams I started having of a young male, white between 20-23, dressed in military fatigues, who was fighting with a woman in the apt. Something happened and he ended up hanging himself on the steam pipe (8"" pipe that runs through the entire apt) in the bathtub. I started seeing a green military style belt hanging off the pipe in the bathroom, out of the corner of my eye. It upset me greatly and did start affecting my mental health. Finally one last violent dream promoted me into doing a full-blown ritual cleansing on the apt.

Afterwards, the place felt better and most of the major weirdness stopped: no sounds, no shadows or shapes, no dreams of that man, and no major creepy feeling from the archway. BUT... Within the last few months has some strange things have started up again. Mainly misty or white shapes out of the corner of my eyes (my boyfriend has told me he swore he saw someone walk through the living room while home alone one morning recently), but also the uneasiness from the archway again. I guess it's time for another cleansing.

The School that Never Sleeps,"Illinois, United States",Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: The School that Never Sleeps

T he following are incidents that have been brought to my attention by my mother, and some I have seen myself. My mother works at an elementary school in the town of Worth, IL. She's been doing janitorial work there for about 7 years now, and I generally go help her when she's on the night shift. Many times, and only while we're at the very front of the school, have we seen what appears to be a man walk down the hallway and turn the corner. Upon further ""investigation"", my mother and I found no one else in the entire building. But the incidents haven't stopped there.

Around September of this year my mother was working alone and was turning off all the lights, on her way to sign out and lock up when she heard a very loud whistle, something along the lines of a dog whistle that seemed to come from a man, or seemed to have a man's tone about it. Knowing she was the only person in the school, she re-checked every room to find no one around, and immediately left.

Recently as well, one of the longest standing teachers passed away. Ever since, smaller stranger coincidences have been happening. Posters will fall off walls, desks will be moved, and erasers will be off the ledges, and strangely enough, absolutely nothing will happen to the deceased teacher's old classroom...

My mother and I tried to dismiss the falling posters as the sticky tack used to adhere them becoming old and dry, but when it happens in every single room, even after a humidifier is placed in every room, that's a bit fishy.

Also on the day that the teacher died, I was the first one in my house to receive the news. I was on the phone with an aid who works there, and in the middle of the conversation, she got another phone call and said she had to go because Jane Smith (I will not use her name here in order to keep her identity safe) was on the other line and she'd have to talk to me later.

A few days later, my mother said her ""friend"" (as we like to call it) had visited her and was moving around chairs in desks. I questioned which student's desk it was and when my mother showed me, it was the daughter of Jane Smith! I've never personally witnessed anything being moved around, nor does it seem to happen while I'm at work with my mother, but I do not doubt my mother's word for an instant. If any of you could have seen her face the night she heard that whistle, as if it was right in her ear, it was of complete and honest fear.

No actual harm has ever come to my mother or me, so we'll continue to watch and see what our Friend gets us into next time.

A Sign from Beyond,"Pennsylvania, United States",Family / Friends Visits,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Family / Friends Visits :: A Sign from Beyond

M y mother past away from a two year battle with cancer in October of 2005; overall it was a terrible experience. She went from weighing 150 pound most of her adult life; to weighing 80 some pounds and suffering from not being able to eat. I have two older sisters. I am the youngest boy and the only boy. Immediately after my mothers passing, both of my sisters had small experiences that hinted to them that my mother was happy and no longer in any pain (we seem to pass ""the Gift"" thought-out our family). However, I had nothing, no sign, no clues/feeling, no dreams, nothing.

Two years to the day after my mothers passing, I walked up into my bedroom. On my dresser mirror in the room, I keep a Mass card from my mother's wake stuck a quarter of the way in between the mirror glass and the wood from the mirror. I went upstairs, walked into my bedroom and the first thing I noticed was this mass card (a picture of Jesus praying and staring into the heavens) flipped upright in a laundry basket on the floor about two and a half feet away from the mirror. I put the Mass card back on the mirror and dropped it about fifteen different times and never once did it get within a foot of falling into the basket. As I mentioned I am in tune with my sixth sense, but I have always tried to ignore visitors or certain feelings. I stopped dropping the card and finally said, ""Mom if that's you, I love you and I really hope you are proud of me"". That is something she would always say to me.

I went downstairs and told my wife what I just experienced (she was already well aware of my families ""gift""). I wanted to let my stepfather know what just took place. He hasn't been himself lately with the anniversary of my mother's passing and with the holiday coming, his spirits were down. I told him the entire story in detail, and I ending it by saying ""I hope this kind of thing does not freak you out or make you feel worse, I felt I needed to tell you... It was probably just the wind or something anyhow"". He told me ""no I actually look forward to these kinds of stories from you and your sisters"". We said our goodbyes and hung up the phone.

Their is a part of the story that I did not mention. My wife and I had a brand new baby girl this year July 2007. We named her after my mother. I have two other children. Both of my children, my wife and I, are Italian and we all have olive colored skin and dark brown eyes. My mother was Scotch/Irish and had fair skin and blue eyes. Our new baby has fair skin and blue eyes as well. In addition, it is really strange when I look in my baby's blue eyes they remind me of my mother's (not the color but the soul- an old soul - if that makes any sense). Sorry, I got a little off track, but it's important to the rest of the story.

It was about 1:00 that same night. My wife fell asleep on the couch downstairs (clearly exhausted from dealing with a newborn baby). I could sleep, so I sat downstairs and stared at some show on the television. I heard the baby crying through our monitor. I walked into my bedroom and that same mass card of Jesus was sitting in the basket flipped upright in the exact same place! Before that day, I never read that back of that Mass card; I read a line in the card in capital letters and it said "" AND TO YOU I GIVE THE GREATEST GIFT OF ALL...""

The Watch,"District of Columbia, United States",Misc,"M y Mom died way too early. She was only 51. It was a very traumatic time for us. It started out with one of the most terrible sounds I know. The phone ringing in the middle of the night. One of my brothers calling to tell me that Mom had a major heart attack and to get home as quick as I can.

My Mom survived for 4 days after her heart attack. She was terribly sick and in pain. Trying to distract her I told her that I lost my watch. The watch was not valuable but it was my only watch and it was driving me crazy not to have it. My Mom latched on to the fact that I lost my watch and it consumed her thoughts. She kept giving me suggestions of where it might be. She finally fell asleep only to wake up about 10 minutes later to say that our Labrador had it. Our Lab was about 9 months old and very mischievous. My Mom started laughing and asked if he swallowed it would I be followed through life by a ticking Labrador like Capt Hook and his crocodile in Peter Pan? It was the last time I heard my Mom laugh.

Mom grew steadily sicker and sicker. The doctors said it was only a matter of time. At one point she died but they were able to revive her. Afterward my Mom said that she knew she had died and she was taken to this special place and in the place she saw some golden snakes or lights flying around. A man came to her and told her that she had to make a decision. She could either keep fighting or she could let go and come with him. My mom said she really wanted to let go and leave with the man but she was worried about who would take care of my Dad and their little dog. I told her that I would support whatever decision she wanted to make. If she wanted to fight I would help her. If she wanted to let go I would take care of my Dad and the dog. That night my Mom rallied. She was even moved to a room outside of Intensive Care and she asked to see her only grandchild who had not been allowed in to see her in Intensive Care. Five minutes after her grandchild left the room, Mom died. We all believed she had rallied just long enough to see her grandchild again and then she let go.

A month went by and I was still missing my Mom terribly (as I still do 10 years later) but life was moving on. I was about to leave on a business trip but I still had not found my watch. I decided to make one more effort and if I didn't find it I would have to buy a new one. After looking everywhere I could think of I turned and looked at the dog. I said to him ""Grandma said that you have the watch. Can I have it back?"" He just stood there looking at me with his tongue hanging out, looking goofy. Then he suddenly cocked his head as if he had heard someone call his name and he ran from the room. Thirty seconds later he was back with something in his mouth. He had my watch. I was dumbfounded. All I could think to do is say ""Thanks Mom!""

The Black Lady in the Window,Philippines,Apparitions / Voices / Touches,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Apparitions / Voices / Touches :: The Black Lady in the Window

I t was past midnight when a necessity woke me up from bed. I was feeling really tired because of the whole day band practice. I searched for the switch of the lights in the living room. I had to cross the living area before I could heed to the comfort room. When I got there, I was awaken by the sudden change of breeze inside. Somehow it gave me a shudder but I really have to deal with the nature's call. I turned on the lights and did what I have to do.

When I had finished, I could feel as if someone was staring me. In my rear view, I could see that a figure of a lady was standing outside the small glass window of the comfort room. But then, I took a second thought. Telling myself that it was just a figment of my imagination. I gathered my wits and reach for the door. I don't know what was I'm thinking but I did turned around and laid eyes in the window. The next thing I felt was the same fright I felt in my encounter with a black ghost in one of my vacations. My head spinned when I laid sight into her white eyes. I know I was trying to shout but I could not hear my own voice. I wanted to scream. But there was no sound. Then, everything went out. The last thing I remembered, the black lady was grinning but there was hate in her eyes.

I woke up in bed with my sister beside me. She asked me what happened but I didn't told a word. The thing was, I don't want to deal with it.

Ghost Boy,Ireland,Ouija Board / Seances,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Ouija Board / Seances :: Ghost Boy

Y ou probably have read my story: My Gift . This one goes along with it. Last night, I communicated with my ghost friend. I wanted to find out what kind of help he needed. Most ghost stay for a need, so I wanted to help him.

Twas frightening at first. I went down to the family living room, knowing that was where he was. I used my little sister's toy alphabet blocks to communicate with him. I arranged the blocks forming this: ""What do you want help with?"" then I would go in the kitchen and wait for five minutes for him to reply back with the blocks. I returned seeing the blocks changed their writing, with only two words: ""My past...""

It confused me a bit, so I asked another question using the toy blocks: ""what of your past?""

I didn't know how my gift could see the past. So I was troubled.

Ghost boy: ""My friend, twelve, killed in Goldfield, Nevada High school...""

Ever since then, I've been doing research of that high school. Anybody know where it is? Or have any history on that school? I would like to know, very much. I've also posted a picture of the ghost boy with this story.

Witches Hill,Latvia,Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: Witches Hill

I lived in small town, in a big house called ""Rozas"". I was a small girl and all the time when I lived in that house (1991- 1998) I saw strange things. At the beginning (I remember all this from age 3) I thought that these things were my imagination or my secret friends, which I have made in my head, because I didn't have friends. But I wasn't the only one who saw THEM. My father, mother, sister, brother and grandparents saw THEM too. How did THEY looked like? And what really did we see?

At first there were sounds like cracking, like somebody is knocking on my door, strange voices next to my window. The kitchen doors was opening very often, but there was no one who can open them and that door wasn't broken. Then we saw shadows like a human beings, THEY were moving in rooms. At night there was a standing man or something next to my bed and HE looked at me, he looked all night. I hated that so much.

When my grandmother died, it was just awful... I cried all night, because she was talking in her room, but she was dead, how could she talk? All night there were sounds in all the house, every door was knocked at least 1000000 times. I thought, that I'll be dead next morning, I thought, that she will hurt me, but I was ok.

When I was older (some 6 years maybe) my dad told me that we have to move to other town. There was many reasons why we had to do that, but there was one very interesting reason. Under our house was something... Maybe a cemetery? I don't know what, but in one book I read, our house is on some kind of witches hill. I was without words. I don't know why, but in my house, where I live right now, I see ghosts and other things. On 21/11/2007, I was in my friends house and in middle of the night I saw a black thing standing in room. I just couldn't move. I was shaking under my blanket... Terrible...

A Scream from Beyond at the Myrtle's Plantation Haunted Tour,"Louisiana, United States",Ghost Tours & Haunted Hotels,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Ghost Tours & Haunted Hotels :: A Scream from Beyond at the Myrtle's Plantation Haunted Tour

I t all started when me and my girl friend when to the Myrtle's Plantation to take the haunted tour. I have never been there before and after hearing how haunted it is supposed to be, I was more than eager to go. She has been there and spent the night with her mom and told me that she didn't have anything out of the ordinary happen to her when they were there.

We arrived a few minutes late for the tour, but the lady giving the tour was nice enough to wait for us after we called and told them we were going to be about 15 minutes late. We arrived and went on the tour which was very nice, and a lot more fun than I thought it would be. I can't say that I believe everything they tell you. However their stories did make for quite a nice experience.

After the tour we were able to walk around their grounds and just enjoy the beauty of the place. We were there for about 3 hours walking around, me taking a ton of pictures trying to get some good images of ghosts, sitting in the gazebo and just enjoying each other's company.

At about 11pm we were sitting in the gazebo, with her to my left. We were just talking about random things that came to mind. We were sitting on the part where our backs were to the water and we were facing the house, when out of no where we had something scream in our ears. It sounded like nothing I have heard before, just this hair raising noise that would be similar to a heavy metal singer belting out a high pitched noise. Needless to say the instant I heard it, I whipped my left arm around in a weak attempt to hit whatever it was that just made the noise, knocking the drink out of my girl friend's hand. I ran about 4 or 5 steps, to just outside the entrance to the gazebo, when I stopped dead in my tracks hearing her picking up everything that I knocked over in my frantic attempt to save myself. Embarrassed, I walked back to her and helped her pick up all of her things.

We had a good laugh after the fact, even though my heart was still racing. I am sure that some of you, even though you are laughing at me, can feel where I am coming from. She was never under any impression other than that I am terrified of ghosts and I make no promises of how I will react when put in those types of situations. Needless to say I would not sit down there for more than a few seconds without getting up and looking behind me. We both agree that it was something from beyond that did that to us.

She found it kind of interesting that she was there for a whole day and night and nothing happened and we were there for a few hours and we already had something like that happen. We now have a room booked for January 6th, 2008. Now when we talk about it, she gets kind of scared because she thinks that I might have something about me that attracts the paranormal. If you look at picture's that other people have taken from this place, you will usually see one or two orbs in their pictures, but for some reason I have about 15-20 in a lot of my pictures along with some very bright little orbs which I don't know if they are called something else or have a specific reason for being so bright, but I will try to get those pictures on here so that you can see what I am talking about and maybe give me some better insight on what causes that.

One thing I do know is that if I do attract ghost's, it is going to be a very long night with very little sleep.

Dancing Ghost,"North Carolina, United States",Apparitions / Voices / Touches,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Apparitions / Voices / Touches :: Dancing Ghost

I t was a warm night in June of 2007. Myself and my ghost hunting partner were at our next destination - the Cove Creek Cemetery. The time was around 11:00 p.m. We had just left from a small cemetery on my aunt's land. I left my camcorder in the front seat - it was so heavy! My partner starts provoking, I provoke along with her. I ask if there are any presences in this graveyard. She asks the presence to let itself be known to us.

We both feel the energy getting stronger, it happened quickly. I step away from my partner a few feet, I shine my flash light around where she and I are standing. I turn my light off, my eyes adjust to the darkness. I ask, ""Will you let us see you?"" I feel a cool breeze around my lower legs. I even hear a breeze below me. Then, right before my eyes, I see a shadow that was dark, but see-thru. It twirls around myself and my partner's legs. It never goes through us, or touches us, but, it literally dances around us and keeps a small cool breeze around it. I laugh, because it seemed at that time like it was dancing around us, letting its presence be known to us in such a cool manner. It lasted for about 3-4 seconds, then was gone. The breeze remained for a couple seconds afterwards.

I ran to my vehicle, grabbed my camera and took a lot of pictures. I have yet to have these pictures developed, I will soon and will update for you who are interested.

Ghost at Alcatraz,"California, United States",Ghost Tours & Haunted Hotels,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Ghost Tours & Haunted Hotels :: Ghost at Alcatraz

I was up in San Jose California for a hockey game with my wife, my son and a friend of my son. We decided to drive to San Francisco and tour alcatraz. Upon arriving to the prison, we started to follow one of the park rangers and listen to his history on the island but it was taken far too long, so we decided to break off and tour ourselves.

We were walking up on the morgue, to the left is a small structure with two doors and a window in each door, as I look over I see a person looking directly at me through the window. I turn to my family and say ""did you see that guy looking at us through the window?"" and I looked back and he was gone. I walked to the doors and looked in the window to complete darkness and the doors were chained shut with a rust lock. The hair on my neck was standing. He was pointy in features, grayish in color with receding combed back hair, I did not see his body but I would say he was approx. 5'6-7"" in height judging from the doors and him looking over the window.

This is something I will never forget. Since I turned 40 this is my second encounter, the first one I did not see but I believe I stayed in a haunted hotel room in venice italy. I will write about that also.

Hotel Room Haunting,Italy,Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: Hotel Room Haunting

I was in Venice, Italy with my wife and some friends, we checked into this hotel, I forget the name because to be honest with you, I did not think I would ever tell this story, but due to this weekends encounter at Alcatraz, I must write. My wife and I enter the room and the room is completely red, red walls red ceiling, red curtains all types of reds with very old and strange furniture made from like bone and mother of pearl. No, I am not the type of person who feels strange things or cold spots and I did not feel anything out of the norm in this room.

So as I check the room and settle in, I wonder to the windows to check out the view. There are two windows, about 48"" in height double window that swing open. I notice that there are two sets, an inner and an outer. The windows lock by two steel latches, one high and one low, so you unlatch and swing the widows open and then proceed to do it a second time on the outer windows. The view is beautiful and I have a picture that I will attach later or post so you can see, over looking the canal below and to the right, across the large body of water, a church that was almost glowing against the light grey sky at dusk.

This was kind of chilling but I took no notice to that sort of feeling. Now this is my first experience with anything of this sort. Well we proceed to do our thing that day, shopping, eating and then we return that night to go to sleep. Now thing get creepy. The first encounter was the usual stuff like footsteps and floorboard creeping, all the normal stuff you hear about but never see or hear, well this, I was hearing it, so I awoke to noises in the bathroom that can not be seen from the bed, but I can see the glow in that small hall way of the light on. I call out to my wife to be a little quieter and then notice that my wife is sound asleep next to me.  I go the bathroom and all is normal. I turn off the light and back in bed I go, this time I bring the covers slightly higher up my head.

I continue to be awaken by the noises. I am a light sleeper. Now I am awaken by the bathroom once again, this time louder and I notice the glow of the light and yes, again my wife sound asleep next to me, so I proceed to the bathroom, this time to find all our stuff in the bottom of the bathtub, toothbrushes, toothpaste, etc. I put it all back and back to bed I go. This time covering my self completely with the sheets, just a small enough hole to see out of. Back to sleep I fall.

I am awaken by loud footsteps again, this time at the foot of the bed walking in the direction of the windows and yes, you guessed it, the windows to the left side of the wall fly open and the sheer curtains blow into the room. I did not see anything or anybody. I just closed the windows and got back in bed completely covered this time. That was the last encounter of the night.

I did not tell my wife of the night because we were staying one more night in the room. The second night nothing happened, or I just slept through it. When we returned home I told my wife what happened that night and asked her if she had use the bathroom, to which she answered ""no why?"" So I told her and you know what she said to me, that when we fist entered the room, she felt weird, almost sick-like and that when she laid down on the bed, the room would spin but she did not want to tell me. She does not drink. So I told her all that happened and she said I should have woke her to change rooms.

This is the first time anything like this has happened to me. This took place in early Feb 2007 and now the encounter at Alcatraz, this weekend 11/21/07, I hope this does not become a regular thing for me. Oh and by the way, we were supposed to go to the winchester house on Friday 11/23/07 but I passed. Maybe I should have gone.

The In-Betweens You See in the Corners of Your Eyes,"Michigan, United States",Non Human Entities,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Non Human Entities :: The In-Betweens You See in the Corners of Your Eyes

W hen I was about twelve or thirteen years old, I began to see something. A short man, about four and a half feet tall, with a burlap vest and long pants torn off just below the knee. He had the proportions of a midget but the way he moved did not resemble a midget's, they were the movements of a proportional human.

I had been seeing something out of the corners of my eyes for quite a while by this time, but nothing so drastic as this. I was wandering into my parents' bathroom to grab something but about five or six feet before I reached the door, I stopped and saw him, out of the corner of my eye, leaning against the door way with his arms crossed and one leg crossed over the other. His stance was ominous but not evil or maybe I just couldn't detect if it was. Now usually he would appear in places at different times and then just vanish but this time he lingered. I stood there frozen, not out of fear but bewilderment, as he ran abnormally fast right through my direct line of sight and then took a sharp turn which lead him right next to me, no further than a few inches from my face. Suddenly he began to quickly mutter something in a loud whisper but I couldn't understand what he was saying. When he was done, he paused for a moment then vanished. Even though he was in the corner of my eye, I should have been able to pick up on some distinguishing characteristics, but all I could see was a nose, eyes, mouth, and shaded face that I can not elaborate on.

This incident didn't trouble me in the slightest, but I did think about it quite often. After that he didn't appear to me again until I was about seventeen years old. He would once again only appear in my peripheral vision, then vanish even before I would attempt to look directly at him. I kept this event secret due to the fear of ridicule, but I decided to converse with a friend about it a year ago when I was nineteen. Even though he was a good friend, I expected an awkward response bur received quite the opposite. He had had a similar experience with a very tall figure, about seven feet tall, who wore a burlap jacket instead of a vest. He had seen the figure on the side of the road while traveling back to his home state of Alabama and I am since more open about the subject.

The last time I saw my figure was in mid to late August of the present year 2007. I was driving home from work at about 10:30 PM and there were no houses on the strip of road I was on and no other cars either, so there was no other source of light to distort my headlights. He walked across the road, about eight feet in front of my car, at a slow pace but he seemed to be moving at the same pace as my car because I was still moving, but I did not get any closer to him. He walked all the way across the road to the opposing side and once again vanished.

I am now almost twenty years old and it is late November and I still continue to see him occasionally, I don't know who or what he is, but I have heard them called In-Betweens because they most often appear in doorways and other passages. If anyone has had a similar experience or knows any source of information on the subject please contact me!

The First Encounter,Puerto Rico,Poltergeists / Physical Manifestations,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Poltergeists / Physical Manifestations :: The First Encounter

T he year, if I'm not mistaken, was 1984. I know because I was getting ready to start kindergarten. I lived in a town called Carolina in Puerto Rico about 30 minutes away from San Juan, the Capital. The house we lived in was shared between my Aunt Mercedes and my Mom. It was left to us by my paternal grandmother Ana. She passed away soon after I was born. I have no early recollection of what her face looked like since the only two pictures of us together are missing her face.

As with any small ""barrio"", Ceramica had its share of ghost stories and folktale. Unfortunately for me, one was my grandma. She was said to be a strong, tall woman of very dark skin. The neighbor gossiped about how men would fall head over heels for her. I hated all the rumors. Specially since most people claimed I looked like her a lot.

My full name is Zaranie... The last part of it dedicated to her. I never really paid much attention to all the stuff being said until one night, this drunk woman who was the odd ball in town, came to my house and claimed she had my grandmothers nails and hair in a container in her medicine cabinet. She said since my grandma was a witch, she waited 'till they buried her and cut them herself to do black magic or ""brujeria"".

It made me so mad, I ran out of the house, I went to my backyard. It was a nice night out with a full moon. Often I would sit by the fruit trees and imagine myself in NY. I had just returned and I loved the train. There I was just looking up at the moon when I hear a hoot on a guanabana tree. I stepped closer to see what it was and I nearly screamed when I looked into a pair of yellow eyes. An owl? In Puerto Rico? Weird. But it just stared at me for long minutes. An odd feeling came over me.

I could not move. My jaw was locked in place. My heart was drumming in my ears. I could hear my mother calling me but I could not move. I must've blinked because when I focused again there was the figure of a woman sitting on the branch of that tree. She was quiet... Just staring at me. So I screamed and I kept screaming 'till my mother came running.

My backyard neighbor was shouting at my mother that she had been in the yard when I came out and she saw me look up and that she too looked up and saw something dark sitting on the tree. Together they took me inside, although my legs refuse to work and they prayed over me and practically choked me on holy water.

After that incident, I was forbidden to go outside alone. It didn't stop my problems from coming indoors. I constantly would jump because I would see things walking past doorways. Or looking through the windows. It became almost impossible for me to sleep unless I was with a grown up. One such time, my mother and my aunt told me they had finally got me to sleep when they saw me walk out of the room and start to crawl halfway down the back hallway. When they followed me, they both saw a woman dressed in white crawling ahead of me. This I don't remember. But I'm glad they were there to get me.

A series of events occurred after that, and I feel the need to warn people who are sensitive to this situations. Things started moving around the house. Items would disappear for days, then show up on counter tops. My mom kept getting pinched... Right now as I'm writing, I have a feeling of heaviness around my throat... Difficulty swallowing... We moved from the house because one night, as I lay awake between my mother and sister, I had the urge to go to the bathroom. I kept trying to hold it because I felt terrified of waking mom or my sister Zilkia.

I counted sheep. I sang baby songs. Almost in tears I gave up and closed my eyes waiting for the inevitable embarrassment of wetting my bed. Then I got this feeling again. It's hard to describe... My limbs become very heavy and I get really cold. My skin pinpricked. I could not move. I looked up at the ceiling like a doll. There was a mist that grew heavier until I could make out a face and hands.

It floated on top of us hovering back and forth and I felt breathing near my face. Hands caressed my face and arms. It felt like if a doctor was prodding me for injuries. Then I noticed the eyes; big and dark and I panicked. I have no idea how but kicking and gagging, I woke my mom and sister and they saw me laying there and started screaming.

Whatever it was went under the bed and shook the rooms to the core. Lamps fell and wind... Wind for the love of God! Came rushing from everywhere. But I could not move. I just closed my eyes and prayed as hard as I could for as long as it took and when it was over I peed on the bed and blacked out.

We moved a lot after that. The incident marked all of us. It definitely scarred me because it seemed to open up sensors in me that took years to understand and control. My clairvoyance got very strong. I get premonitions very often. And even though I still can't understand this part... I can see spirits sometimes.

I welcome all honest readers to give me a first, second and even third opinion to what is wrong with me and to refer me to a good psychiatrist if you believe I suffer and illness.

Thank you for taking the time to read the beginning of my life.

My Beginning 2,"Indiana, United States",Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: My Beginning 2

W hen we moved from the house in Goshen to the one in Elkhart, Mom and Dad watched me all the time. It was like they were waiting to see if anything weird would happen here to. I got to pick out which room I wanted and I picked the biggest one. But it was the coldest one. We couldn't do a thing to get it warm. Even in the summer.

My brother was just a couple of months old and I thought he was mine. I wanted to do everything for him even though I was young. I would take him in my room to play when mom was upstairs. He would play for a little bit, but if he got close to the closet he would cry and act like I was beating him. Mom always took him away saying I had to be nice. We would just be playing, I didn't know why he would cry.

Mom and Dad slept across the hall with my brother. His room was down the hall, but he was too little to sleep there alone, because the top of the stairs had no railing. We were afraid he would fall down them if he was looking for Dad.

When it was time to go to bed, I started to hear gunshots. Two right after the other, and they came out of the closet. Then would come a horrible, long sound that was like a cry and a moan at the same time. It would last for a couple of minutes and then just stop. I would go check it out, from behind a door, but never saw anything.

Soon a boy would start to visit me. First I was sleeping and told my Mom about him only because the back of his head was gone. She told me I must have had a nightmare and to try to sleep again. After going in her room about five times one night, (there wasn't room in the bed, my brother was there) she came in and said ""look, you look really scary to my girl, you need to stop bothering her"". I did not have the dream again.

The next night at bed time, there was a knock on the door. No one was there. Then it knocked again. It was coming from the closet. I just kept saying ""please don't hurt me, please don't hurt me"". I looked, but no one was there either so I went to bed. What could I do? I was hearing things. I'm not sure why, but he decided to come out. I know it was his face, but he had a whole head. It just sort of filled in from the dream. He became my friend and warned me about the woman of the house. I thought he meant my Mom.

Too much to tell in one story, but the basement was like a bus terminal. There would be all kinds of things down there coming and going. That was Dad's computer room and Moms laundry, so we were down there a lot. I just tried to stay out of the computer room.

There was a mirror on the back of the bathroom door that you could see a woman in when it was all foggy from a shower. She was strange though. She would sort of change in features where she would look like she was a guy dressed up as a girl for halloween. Mom actually talked to her in the mirror and she WROTE back through the mirror.

People got sick in that house a lot. That's when Mom found Brenda and her husband at work. They are pagan and are the healers of their clan. We did a couple of outings with them and Mom spent a long time studying with Brenda to get rid of what was in our house. Brenda brought two friends over and we did a cleansing like I never saw before and that was scary. The things I saw didn't go away though, they just hid.

If anyone would like to hear of these other stories, I'll tell them too. But I'm trying to find out why they keep coming to me. If anyone has any suggestions I'll listen, too many things happen around me and no one will spend the night. I want to have friends come over.

Dark Blob on my Ceiling,Canada,Misc,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Misc :: Dark Blob on my Ceiling

I have this issue with sleeping by myself, basically... I hate it. So sometimes as stupid as it sounds... I kind of lift my sister up from her bed and half carry, half drag her in my bed. She's used to it and is content with it when I tell her she came in my room at night. I scold her and tell her to stay in her own bed! So this particular night she was awake and came into my room.

Imagine my surprise. I gladly let her in. We got into this deep discussion about ghost and demons and things. As we were talking I notice this black shape on the ceiling. I actually really did not think anything about it though, until I shifted my eyes up. It started to bother me but I immediately thought that it was the shadow of my fan or tv. So I poked my sister and we both agreed we would find out what the blob thing was. We started moving this quietly as my mom was sleeping next door. I moved the fan, the blob stayed. I moved the Tv. The blob stayed. Basically... we moved everything except for my damn bed. Me and my sister looked at each other and ran in the bed. It was hilarious at the time. But now that I think about it it creeps me out.

So after seeing the blob shift towards the other corner, I actually got really scared. I prayed like a damn nun. And so did my sister. Then I couldn't believe it. A white blob showed up and the dark blob disappeared. The white thing stayed there all night. I believe in god and I'm christian, but wow. To see it really happening. And how good it feels to be protected. It's wonderful

You know I got on this site and started reading these things and I always get scared. I actually can't sleep now. I keep thinking something I did bad in my life is going to come for me in a demon form. I'm terrified. I really think I have a problem.

Somebody maybe you could help me. Hope you liked my little story.

Our Thanksgiving Guest,"Indiana, United States",Family / Friends Visits,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Family / Friends Visits :: Our Thanksgiving Guest

O n Thanksgiving this year, we decided to celebrate at home. We lost my Father-in-Law earlier this month to lung cancer, so we were not yet ready for the free for all that most of our family gatherings seem to become. We decided that we would hold Dad's Celebration of Life on this day, and did not want all the extra noise and hassle that a multitude of people can create.

We invited only my husband's aunt and her son, whom I will here out call Don. My husbands aunt had to work, so we were down to one guest, but that was fine. It was time for us to start our own traditions, but were not yet comfortable with the idea, and he was our buffer. Don brought along his new digital camera and three brand new memory chips. We were going to christen this camera properly.

All day long our four year old son ran around with his imaginary friends. He entertained, set three extra places at his table, ate with them and played in his room with them while impatiently awaiting the time for the Celebration of Life ceremony.

We chose Thanksgiving Day as we DO have so much to be thankful for. Thankful that he is no longer struggling for breath. Thankful that a walk to the mailbox no longer will cause us alarm. Thankful that he now has the opportunity to rekindle old friendships and possible a few friendly wars too. Thankful, also, that the Great Spirit rode up on His magnificent white steed and led him into the Land of Many Summers.

Periodically throughout the day Don would snap off photos of our children. His son had spent the holiday with his ex-wife, so he was feeling lost without him and filled the down time with our children. The traditional after turkey nap was replaced with photo shoots all over the house and yard. The kids loved it. Well, at one point the fifteen year old would have enjoyed a nap, but Don was not going to let that happen.

When it was time for the Celebration of Life we all headed outside. As Dad loved a good campfire we built a huge bonfire in our fire pit. I won't go into the details of the ceremony as it turned rather lengthy and soon the sun was setting. As we were privately saying our personal farewells to this man who graced our presence for too short a time, I looked over to where my son was playing by the fire pit. All I could do was watch him.

We all heard him say ""Please don't go yet..."" I caught my breath. I had been waiting for a visit from my Father-in-Law since his passing and I was waiting to hear my son say papa. He never did. Instead he reached up his arms and simply said ""Hugs"". That is his way of asking for a hug when his emotions overwhelm him and he is on the verge of tears.

I am not going to lie. I did not see a thing. I looked. Don, however saw the opportunity of a snapshot to rival JFK Jr's final salute to his Dad and took some photos. What we got was interesting. Near the top left hand corner, in a direct line from my son's up reached arms is a faint orb.

He seemed so happy. I do not know that this was his Papa's spirit who had come to join us on Thanksgiving. I do not know WHOSE spirit it may have been, or even if it was one. What I do know is the pure joy on the face of my son as he lowered his arms, turned his face forward and waved goodbye.

We had a few more interesting photos that day also. In one, a wisp of something can be seen immediately behind my daughters head. In another there is a type of fog (on an otherwise very clear night) over the love seat that used to be Dad's favorite outside chair.

I'd like to say that Dad joined us in his Celebration of Life, but the truth is, I do not know. What do these photos show?

My Haunted Bedroom,"New Jersey, United States",Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: My Haunted Bedroom

T his all began when I was about the age of 6. I am now 14 and this still occurs. My bedroom is haunted or at least I would hope it is with the things that happen in it. When I'm in my bed at night and just about to doze off, my bed shakes violently, scaring me half to death. I wake up and it's still shaking, of course like all people I ran out of my room, but just as I'm about to leave my room the door shuts making me not able to leave. Of course like any normal person would do I screamed on the top of my lungs. My mom comes in and there I am crying, with my quilt wrapped around me sitting in the back of the door.

Now on to what occurred just recently. I was laying on my bed reading a tiger beat magazine and out of nowhere I hear muffled whispering, but nothing that I could make out. It was hard to understand. Then I heard a deep male voice (very scary) say my name. That's when I froze. I knew it wasn't my dad or any of my brothers because I had stayed home from school that day, and I was the only one home with my 70 year old grandma. Of course it couldn't have been her. I sat up in my bed, and all I saw was this black hooded figure in my closet (it was a walk-in closet). I was shocked. I didn't scream, I didn't move. It was almost as if I was mesmerized by this figure. I felt warm tears fall down my cheeks, although I didn't do anything. I was in a trance. Then it disappeared in thin air. That's when I ran downstairs and I told my grandma everything. And of course like all grandmas she tells me it must have been my imagination. And believe me, it wasn't.

Later that night (which was recently; friday night the 23rd of November.) I refused to sleep in my own room, but yet my parents made me. I was so upset and scared to be in my room alone. I put the blankets up to my neck, closed my eyes and prayed and prayed and prayed until I dozed off. I was awoken by this gust of wind. I was freezing. My lips were blue as anything, I couldn't feel my fingers and every single window in my bedroom was open. They were wide open, to the point were you can't open them anymore. Mind you it's the middle of winter and that night it was probably the coldest night of winter so far. I got up closed the windows and went back in my bed. I faced the windows to see if whatever was making them open, would dare to open them in my view. And to my luck. The windows opened slowly one by one. I was in shock once again because I didn't see anything, but the crucifix between both windows was turned upside down. I started to cry, because I now thought I was dealing with something demonic.

Now it's pretty quiet but every now and then, I hear footsteps coming by my bedroom door and then they stop by my door leaving two feet shadows on the bottom which are clearly visible to see. Then the feet disappear. I check to see if anyone is in the hallway or in any of the rooms upstairs by me, but nobody is there.

I am scared and clueless as to if this thing is just a joker or if its demonic? I need to know what to do and how to do it. This is my first story and my first encounter and I am glad to share it with you people. I need some help. Thanks

Ghost in the Cabin at Phantom Ranch,"Illinois, United States",Misc,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Misc :: Ghost in the Cabin at Phantom Ranch

I know this story may sound weird to you. About two years ago, I went to my second year of church winter camp. We get there and settle into are cabin. Then the heat brakes. We had to repack everything. We moved into a cabin right next to the woods!

It was really dark out and looked scary at the camp. Just so you know the camp's name is Phantom Ranch. The name just scares the creep out of me. We were walking to night chapel (chapel is like church). My friend sees foot prints leading right into the woods! She didn't say anything. We got back to chapel. She noticed that the foot prints were gone. She still didn't say anything.

That night when we went to bed, I heard something knocking on the window. Then I heard what sounded like someone hammering on the side of the cabin. And just so you know it was at least 1:00 in the morning, so I don't think it could of been the boys trying to scare us. The boys cabin was up a huge hill. And they were probably sleeping.

Then all of a sudden I heard the door open and close. I look over to the door and see nothing. I was totally freaked out now! I knew it couldn't have been the boys because I would've seen them outside when the door opened. I thought it opened. It didn't. I just heard the noise.

At this point, I didn't know if I was the only one hearing the noise or if other people were too! I finally fell asleep. When I woke up, my friend that saw the foot prints asked me if I heard anything last night. I said that I did! Then she told me that she saw foot prints last night. And when we came back from the chapel, they were gone. And the weird thing is that it didn't snow that night at all. The next night the same thing happened.

The next year, the boys had that cabin. We asked them if they had heard anything like knocking on the windows or doors opening. They said they had. So if you think you know what it might be in the cabin, then tell me. And I want to tell you I don't go to that camp anymore.

The Ghost of the Lionel Wendt Theatre,Sri Lanka,Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: The Ghost of the Lionel Wendt Theatre

H i again to everyone at YGS. I've been away for a while because I had my promotion tests last week, and I got my results today! My relations were really happy with my scores because I didn't study that much since I had choir and drama practices in the middle of it. I'm happy to say I did well. Now, onto the story.

It was an evening of music, dance and drama. I'll divide it into 3 parts.

Part 1 was music, where there was singing and instrumentals performed by the age range of 13 - 18. Part 2 was dance (same age range for all 3 parts). And the 3rd part was drama. I managed to sing a solo. I sang I'll be, by Edwin McCain, and I danced in 7 items. I also managed direct my own story that I wrote, and I acted in Macbeth, written by Sir William Shakespeare. All this during my exams! I was one of the weird sisters in Macbeth... I wonder why. Well, it was loads of fun! (The practices).

...Except on the day we performed. It was when the 3 weird sisters stood around the cauldron, stirring the pot, and saying ""Double, double, toil and trouble. Fire burn and cauldron bubble."" A few people started talking quite loudly. We ignored and went on. We got through the scene. And after we finished performing Macbeth and went for a curtain call. I came downstairs, with 4 hangers in my hand and 2 huge bags around my arms. I sat on a bench and took a deep breath. My face was still with black eye liner and black lipstick. I couldn't get it off. That lady who put my make-up did a good job! I took out a tissue out of my pockets and tried to rub it off, when a male voice said, ""If you try to rub it even more you won't have any skin left"". I turn around, to see Mr. Damien, one of THE best actors and choreographers in Sri Lanka. I got up from the bench and I smiled, putting my tissue into my pocket. The acting was fabulous, he said.

Thank you sir, I replied with a big smile. He laughed and said, I need a favor from you, he said. Sure, sir. He smiled and asked, can I have a group photo of you and the other 3 sisters? I smiled and said, I'm one of the sisters, let me go call the other 2, I just turned around and he said, ""Yes, I know you are one, but there were four on stage"". I looked at him, confused. Before I could answer, his cell phone rang, and he picked up. A few moments later he said, ""I'm sorry sweet, but I have to rush outside to meet some people, I will be at the Hotel for the after party, I hope meet the four of you there"", he said, as he walked off quickly.

I sat back down on the bench, confused. A fourth witch? But, there was only the 3 of us on stage at that moment, I said to myself. Followed by half of my classmates pouring into the room. They were looking for me, confused but happy I said, ""hey you guys. So what do you think?""

My best friend Nathan said Shenny that was awesome! I thanked everyone for coming, I said good bye to some of them, and there was only a few people left in the room. One of the guys in my class, called William, loves William Shakespeare's work. He knew almost every line of his sonnets and his favorite story is Macbeth. He smiled at me and said, ""It was a great play, I enjoyed Macbeth very much, but I don't think it was right that you guys added more people onto the original story..."" ""What do you mean?"" I asked. ""There are supposed to be only THREE weird sisters... there were FOUR on stage"". What? That's not possible; it was only the 3 of us.

""Well, you better tell the other 6,000 people out there who are wondering why there were 4 on stage. And trust me that fourth one looked very real, and scary.""

My eyes went wide open, You're pulling my leg, right? I asked. He shook his head, with a serious face. I sat back down on the bench.

Well, see you, he said and walked off. Nathan walked over and said, Dude, your supposed to be at the after party. I looked up at him and asked, ""How many weird sisters were there on stage?"" ""Um... Four"", he said in a calm voice. ""Look, you know I suck at poetry and all that jazz. I only write songs. Anyways, your aunt's calling you. Oh, be right back Nat.""

I ran outside, to the corridor and my aunt was standing there, with a bright smile, ""Hey Sweetheart, you did very well"". Thanks. I said, as I hugged her. I took a deep breath, still a bit tired and sat on the floor; she knelt down and said to me, ""I know who the fourth weird sister was..."" I looked at her and said, ""But there was no fourth sister..."" ""A dead one sweety."" ""Oh, now I get it. So, who is it?"" I asked.

She took a deep breath and said, ""an actress named Merna; she committed suicide in the changing room you were in"". I froze, and I told her. No wonder I always felt like someone was watching me, and from the corner of my eye I saw something black on stage, but I thought it was the black curtain!

""Now, we don't want anyone getting worried. So let's keep hush about it, and just enjoy the party, I'll pick you up later"". I smiled, and she winked at me. Bye, drive home safely, I said. And I turned around and walked back into the room.

William was there, with some of his cousins. And we talked for a while, when suddenly, from nowhere I heard a cell phone ring. It sounded so familiar, it was coming from upstairs. And when I looked for my phone, I realized I left it upstairs. I ran up, alone. And I opened the door to my changing room, and I walked to the other end of the room, when I found my cell phone on the table. As I picked it up, the door closed shut. And there are no windows in this part, just A/C. Yeah, thanks Ryan, Ryan is my cousin who I have experienced a lot with. So he always played pranks on me. So I walked over to the door and said. ""Okay, Ryan open the door! Or else I'll get late"". I heard heavy breathing, and I heard a female voice saying, ""It's only you and me"". A gust of icy cold wind went by me, and the A/C wasn't even turned on.

I took out my chain which has blessed medals, and I put it around my neck. My aunt and uncle taught one important lesson, never show fear, they feed on it. They live on it. I tried opening the door and it opened. Thank God for that! I went downstairs. And Nathan and the rest were sitting on the benches waiting for me. ""Let's go. Race you outside!"" Nathan said. ""You're on!"" I said. Well, after that, we had fun. And now I'm just excited to go to the Lionel Wendt with my aunt and uncle along with my cousins to do some hunting.

My Haunted House 2,Poland,Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: My Haunted House 2

H i everyone. This happened to me 2 nights ago but the story goes back to 2 months. Me and my wife live in my fathers house. It is a very big house, 290 m2. We live upstairs and my dad and step mom live downstairs. Well my dad loves antiques. Sometimes we think it is some kind of addiction but he keeps saying that it is a good investment. In my other story I told you about my haunted house but everything just went quiet. I think it just woke up.

My dad bought a wardrobe from an antique store. It was pretty old. My dad says it was made in 1850s. It really looked nice and well preserved but I didn't think much about it because he buys so many things that you can really loose count. After he bought it things started to go weird again. It started when I couldn't sleep. I would wake up around 1.00am and just couldn't sleep. I went to the kitchen to have a smoke. I heard footsteps but very quiet ones. I thought it was my grandma but she broke her leg 4 months ago and the doctors said she shouldn't walk a lot because there are some complications (her bones are very weak from some kind of disease). I went to check but nothing there.

A couple days later my cousin came over and we were watching tv. For at least 2 weeks I have been seeing something from the corner of my eye but I wasn't really sure what. This only happened in my living room and in the same place. I kept looking there once every few minutes. I thought it was a mouse or something but never saw anything. I was talking with my cousin just about everything when I asked him a question. Do you see things from the corner of your eye and when you look there is nothing there? He said ""Rarely. But something is by your tv. Don't know what but I just keep looking there"".

Well that kind of freaked me out but at the same time that gave me some proof that there is something going on in my house. But the scariest thing happened to me 2 nights ago. I had to wake up around 12.00 to go to the train station and pick up my step father. I didn't want to go alone so my wife drove with me. We dropped him of at his house and we were driving back home. I got out of the car and went to the house. I entered the house first because my wife was busy looking for something. I took off my shoes and started to make my way through the hall when all of a sudden the wardrobe started to shake. Not long but maybe for 5 seconds. I was shocked. I thought it was me because I'm a pretty big boy and maybe I caused it to vibrate. I walked be side it with hard steps and nothing. I remember carrying that wardrobe with my dad and it ways a lot since it being oak. I didn't tell my wife about this incidence because she really doesn't like to talk about the paranormal.

I'm not sure what is going on in my house but I think that something has to do with the furniture my dad has. Let me know what you think. I hope to hear from you soon.

Good Advice,"Nebraska, United States",Family / Friends Visits,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Family / Friends Visits :: Good Advice

I n a couple of my other stories and comments, I have indicated that 'things' have happened to me pretty much as long as I can remember that have something to do with paranormal. When I was a child, I was told not to let my imagination run away with me, that I needed to stop playing with my imaginary friends and that I shouldn't tell stories that weren't true. I am not sure how a grown see through man in your closet talking to you, smile and simply vanish isn't true, but you get the gist.

As a teen, I was called a flake, told to not make up lies, and invariably learned to keep my experiences to myself. As I grew into an adult, I realized that these occurrences are not and was not my imagination. I have also learned there is a select few that I can share these occurrences with and this group is one avenue that I can share with.

One of the many occurrences that keep coming to mind happened when I was about 16. My mother's dad, the very best grandpa a girl could hope for had a stroke. He had worked hard his entire life, woke up one morning and could not vocalize his thoughts. We took him to the ER; they ran tests and determined he had a major stroke. He was hospitalized for about 3 weeks, during that time he continued to have min-strokes as they called them. I was devastated. Grandpa was my rock, my anchor and I loved him dearly. We were nearly inseparable as I grew up. I was his angel and he my hero. We tried to bring him home with us after he left the hospital, but, unfortunately the medical care he required soon got a head of us and we realized that he would need around the clock assistance. He was then admitted to a nursing facility here in Omaha.

Grandpa had gone into his own world. He did not recognize any of us nor did he seem to have any idea of what was happening around him. My mom had an extremely difficult time visiting him because, well, as I had he was a rock of stability before this happened. I continued to visit him regularly; I was determined that one day he would simply 'snap' out of it and be the same person he had been.

After visiting many months and seeing no change, I became angry and depressed because all of my dreams for him had not happened. We (my mom, sister and I) were living in an upstairs duplex apartment of a south Omaha home. I went home that Saturday and stomped up the stairs, mad at the world and determined that everything in life was horrible. I went into my room, closed the door and flopped on my bed, grabbing my book and flipping on the stereo. I was the only one home at the time, so I thought I would crank up the music and sing so loud I could get some of my frustrations out.

I had my paper back book open in my hands reading and singing. All of the sudden my book was knocked out of my hand and sent flying across the room. I didn't drop it, it went sailing! I sat there for a minute staring at the place where the book landed, in awe and angry still. I got up and picked up my book and went back to the bed, as I sat down my stereo turned off. I tried to turn it back on, but it would not work. I checked the lights to see if a fuse had blown or something, but the only thing not working was the stereo. Okay. I decided I would read without the music. I sat on my bed and began reading. I looked up as I heard a creak near the door, like a floor board creaking when you walk across. There was a woman with short curly dark hair, beautiful light olive complexion, a bit on the fill figure side smiling at me. She looked very familiar yet I was not sure who she was. I sat there, not able to speak, not knowing what to do.

She looked at me and said, 'Your grandpa did NOT mean for any of this to happen. He only wanted to work, stay happy and care about his grand-babies; this was an unfortunate incident and there is nothing can be done and nothing to be angry about. He is still around because his will does not allow him to do other wise. So, knock it off, tell him you love him and get on with your life!' she smiled again at me. I looked down to the ground then back up at the woman, ready to ask who she was and how did she know so much about my family? She was gone. The door had not opened; there was no other way in or out of the room. She was simply gone. My stereo resumed playing.

All the rest of that day and Sunday I thought about what she had said, mulling it over in my mind. As I went through the hallway Sunday evening, I looked up at some family portraits on the wall. There was a lovely picture of my Aunt Linda in her younger years, as a young woman. She had passed on in child birth when I was 7 years old. Aunt Linda as a young woman WAS the woman that had chastised me lovingly in my room the day before!

I did try to take her advice to heart. Grandpa did not recover; he carried on for another couple of years before he was at peace and joined the rest of his family. I continued to visit him regularly and my love and respect for him never faltered and never will!

Pinned Down in Bed,United Kingdom,Old Hags / Night Attacks / Sleep Paralysis,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Old Hags / Night Attacks / Sleep Paralysis :: Pinned Down in Bed

F or the past three nights I have been experiencing this pinning down and it is really starting to scare me. The first time it happened was Friday morning at about 6.15am, just before I was about to get up.

My dog had woken me, at about 5.30am, barking to be let out of the kitchen so that she could come upstairs (which she does from time to time, but hadn't done for a while) I went back to bed and was laying on my back, all of a sudden I felt as though someone was laying on top of me or the duvet was being stretched down evenly over me, I couldn't move or speak. I managed to cough quietly and the pressure lifted, almost instantly. I laid there too scared to move for about ten minutes, then reached for my mobile phone to see what the time was and it felt as though someone kicked the end of my bed. I leapt from bed and put the light on and ran downstairs.

The next night I had the same feeling of the pressure about 4 separate times, but couldn't be sure whether I was dreaming it or not, so didn't get too worried.

Last night however I woke at about 4.48am and put my light on rolled over, turned the light back off and went back to sleep. At 5.19am I woke to this pressure again (it was just on the top half of my back this time, I was laying on my front) and I was fighting for my breath as I woke. I managed to switch my bed side lamp on (I had gone to sleep with the switch in my hand) seconds after the light went on the pressure lifted.

I laid there for a few minutes, with the light on, but started to feel really un-easy. I went downstairs to sleep in the living room with our dog for a couple of hours, with no interference, then decided to go back to bed (with the curtains open as daylight was breaking). I was woken at about 8.00am by the pressure again which seemed to keep varying in strength from the strongest I had felt to barely anything, then it got stronger, then weaker, stronger again and then lifted all together.

I'm feeling really apprehensive about going to bed tonight and would appreciate any advice.

Also I took a photo in my room last night and could see two very feint circles of light, I don't know if there is any connection here.

We have lived in this house all of my life, I am 24. There hasn't really been anything like this before, although my sister did think she saw a dark shadow watching over her one night, but she only experienced this once about two years ago.

I have had the occasional nightmare in the past and woken all sweaty and breathing heavily, but always assumed that was pretty normal.

I'm really into rock and metal music and I do like horror films. I had been to a gig of a gothic metal band two nights before the first experience. Does anyone think there could be any connection to this perhaps? Have I somehow attracted whatever is causing these experiences with the music I listen to?

I do get scared that 'it' may win, so to speak, it is getting quite persistent.

My mum has had strange experiences when she was around the age I am now, but not the same sort of thing.

P.S. My parents never got around to getting me christened as I was the fourth child, my older siblings were all christened.

My Sister,"California, United States",Family / Friends Visits,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Family / Friends Visits :: My Sister

I n 2003 my family was hit with a horrific blow. My eldest sister Shara was killed in a car accident. My entire family was devastated.

Just a little background on my family. We have always been and always will be a tight knit family. There are six siblings total. Two boys and four girls. My poor parents had their hands full with all of us.

Shara was 12 years older than I was, but age meant nothing. We were all best friends to each other. She was the first one to call for any of us if something exciting, sad, or just plain old interesting happened to us. She was always there one way or another to listen to us, make us laugh when we were sad, or just plain old stick up for us if someone was not being too nice to us. She was just an awesome person. Always there for us when we needed her most.

In this case I feel as though it was no different. In the early morning hours of July 4th my sister was killed in a single car collision. They believe that she had a seizure while driving and she hit a telephone pole.

The accident was in the newspaper the next day. When looking at the photo you could see in the pictures faces all around the car. Including my sister's face, as though the picture had been snapped just as she was leaving her earthly body. This was amazing to us like a little gift from God.

The days that followed us were filled with busying ourselves making all the arrangements, eating the mountain of food brought to our homes, going through pictures, crying, laughing, and just loving one another through all of this.

Three days before the funeral, my mother, myself, and a few of my aunts were in a little flower shop to purchase an arrangement to place in her casket with her at the viewing. I was just casually browsing through the shop looking at all the little trinkets placed around on the shelves and tables. I got this tingling sensation on my left shoulder, like someone had just slightly brushed it with their finger tips. I looked over to my left quickly and there she was Shara.

I couldn't believe it was actually her just smiling at me. She had a slight glow as though I could see her aura all around her. Her nose had the little crinkle it always got when she was smiling from ear to ear. She looked beautiful her hair cascading in curls like she had worn it when it was long. Her eyes were filled with what I can only describe as pure joy. In that moment I knew life had not truly left her, she just transformed like a butterfly shedding its cocoon.

This was the first of many visits from her to my entire family. Sometimes to each individually, at others to all of us at the same time. She comes in many forms to us. Sometimes a scent, sometimes dreams, sometimes we can actually see her. I guess heaven just wouldn't be heaven if you couldn't have your family too.

An Overnight Guest,"Tennessee, United States",Apparitions / Voices / Touches,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Apparitions / Voices / Touches :: An Overnight Guest

M y older brother Earl (not his real name) joined the Air force right after he graduated high school in 1970. He had been in service for about a year, so this would have happened in late '71 or early 72.

I was lying in bed late one night when I heard the stair door open and someone coming up the staircase. I then heard footfalls cross the room, the light came on and I heard someone sit down on my brother Earl's old bed. I slept in the far right hand corner and his bed was right next to mine. I was lying facing the wall, I didn't bother turning over, I just assumed it was Earl coming in on leave.

I spoke and said, ""is that you Earl"" and a low, deep voice said ""Yeah"" I notice it didn't sound like Earl but I knew too that he had a habit of picking up the accents of whomever he happened to be buddying with. I then asked if he was doing alright and the same low voice said ""yeah"". I then said, ""Well I'm tired and it sounds like you are too, so I'll talk to you in the morning O.K..."" I got an O.K. back. All this time I had my back turned facing the wall, I don't know why I didn't turn and talk to him face to face.

About this time the light went out and I heard him lay down. That particular bed made a certain noise when you laid down on it. I said ""good night"" but got no answer and soon fell asleep.

Well, when I got up the next morning I noticed that Earl wasn't in his bed and the bed was made up. I thought nothing of it, just chalked it up to military training. I went downstairs and looked around but I didn't see Earl anywhere. I asked Mom where Earl was and she replied ""How would I know?"" I said ""Well he came in last night"" and she said ""No, he didn't..."" I said ""But, I talked to him"" and Mom said ""I don't know who you talked to but it wasn't Earl because no one came in last night"".

Mom and Dad assured me that I must have been dreaming. I agreed but I knew better. I talked to someone that night.

Was I dreaming?, I could have been but I don't think so. Could it have been my imagination? Could have been, but I think if it had been, with the imagination I had at that age that I would have scared the crap out of myself.

The only thing that gave me the creeps and still does is this: If I wasn't dreaming, or imagining things, If I had turned over to talk to my ""brother"" who or what would I have seen?

My Bed Felt Like a Treadmill,"New York, United States",Old Hags / Night Attacks / Sleep Paralysis,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Old Hags / Night Attacks / Sleep Paralysis :: My Bed Felt Like a Treadmill

I have gotten sleep paralysis on various occasions since I've been at college, but the one experience I'm going to write about is the one that confuses me the most. I had stayed up all night to do a paper or something, but from 9 to 9:30 in the morning I took a nap on my bed face down. I had my arms above my head with my hands face down.

All of a sudden I felt the sleep paralysis starting, and since I had read about it online a few times by then, I decided to just relax and see if it just ended by itself.

Well by then it felt like I was moving backwards towards the foot of the bed. I could distinctly feel my comforter moving underneath my hands. It was like I was on a treadmill, because even though I was moving backwards, I was actually not moving at all, the bed was moving. Then when it wasn't stopping, I just tried to move my fingers until it finally stopped.

Then I sensed something over my right shoulder but far away in the upper corner of the room, but when I looked there was nothing there.

It's probably the weirdest/scariest experience I've had relating to sleep paralysis or OBE.

I think the next time I had something weird like this happen to me I was just floating above my bed near the ceiling, which wasn't scary at all.

Oh yeah, and the first time I ever had something like this happen to me was my freshman year. There was a scary evil man or something else laying next to me in my bed. I saw his face though and it wasn't a human face. But that was a different dorm room, and it was the only time I ever saw something. That first experience could have been a dream, I have no idea.

"Not Scary, Just Cute",Canada,Pets / Animals,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Pets / Animals :: Not Scary, Just Cute

W hen I first met my boyfriend his roommate had this wonderful little kitty named Cheech. I never liked a cat before Cheech, he was small and orange and he had the funniest little personality. Well not long after I moved in with the two of them, the roommate's girlfriend had to get rid of her cat Satchmo so we just took him to our place. Cheech and Satchmo HATED each other. Then Cheech got sick and we just thought we was depressed because of Satchmo, our place is pretty small and they pretty much had to be in the same room.

Cheech got worse and worse and one night we had people over and them thinking cheech was the same old kitty, they let him out. He ran away and hid under the house and we didn't find him until about 3 days later. He was still alive but in really bad shape so we took him to the vet, but sadly he died. We got him cremated but didn't get the ashes until about a month after he died.

Not long after he died (about a week) we got 2 kittens that we were already supposed to get before cheech died. We called the Kittens Ziggy and Marley. At first everything was normal but the night that we got Cheech's ashes, home weird stuff started to happen. Not scary just unusual. The first night I was sitting on my bed and Marley was laying on my stomach. Ziggy was on the edge of the bed and it was like she was playing with another cat but no other cat was there. She would jump and pounce on this one thing that she kept following with her eyes and playing exactly the same as she would with Marley. I just thought she was being crazy but it still happens about once a week.

Even with the new kitten that my room mates just brought home (Mr. Stubbs is his name) he will play with nothing while the others sleep... I don't know why they would play with nothing when they have tons of toys to play with, which is why I think it is cheech.

Another strange thing that happens quite often is when Satchmo comes inside. He will try to use the litter box which is down the hall in the bathroom but every time he gets too close to the litter box, he will start hissing and get so scared he will accidentally go on the floor sometimes. This is exactly what would happen when Cheech was alive and Satchmo would venture down there when Cheech was already in there. He does it every time, even when we are down there with him. We tried changing the litter and taking the lid off and even getting a new box and letting him use it before the others. Nothing works! Poor Satchmo barely comes inside because he is so scared!

Now those are not the things that made me want to write about this on here. The other night I was sitting on the couch watching tv with my boyfriend and I had Ziggy and my boyfriend was holding Mr. Stubbs. Marley was behind my head on the back of the couch and Satchmo was outside. All of a sudden I saw something out of the corner of my eye and I looked over to see an orange cat run down the hall jump on the chair and then when he went to jump down, he just disappeared. At first I thought I was mistaking one of the other cats but not only were they all beside me, none of them are orange. Ziggy and Mr. Stubbs are black and Marley and Satchmo are grey and white.

Now I know that this story probably bored you to pieces and it is nowhere near as scary as any of the stories but I just love the fact that our kitty came back I had to write it.

Grandma's Message to Mother,"Illinois, United States",Family / Friends Visits,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Family / Friends Visits :: Grandma's Message to Mother

M y grandmother was sick my whole life. Having suffered rheumatic fever as a child, she never fully recovered and it seemed every year a new malady was added to her list of medical conditions. Every Christmas people would say, ""We have to make Christmas special, this will be mother's last Christmas..."" But from the age of 4, I would always say ""Grandma's not going to die. She won't die until she sees my first born...""

When my son was born, grandma couldn't see because of cataracts. This was okay with me, if she couldn't see, she couldn't die. At this time I lived 60 miles away and didn't see my grandmother often, but when I did I would place my son on her lap and she would play with his hair. During one of these visits she said ""Oh my God, he looks just like your father..."" This really upset me because no one told me she could see.

The next morning I heard my 7 month old son playing in his crib. It was early for him to be up and he was laughing like I never heard him laugh before. I went in there to see what he was so amused with and there stood my grandmother. She was beautiful and healthy. Her body wasn't crippled up and she was young. She looked at me and said ""Goodbye pumpkin..."" then the phone rang. She said ""That's your mother, tell her I always loved her..."" and then she was gone.

I picked up the phone and said ""Hi mom"" before she said anything. She then told me grandma had died. I told her I already knew that and then I relayed the message. This made my mother cry, as my grandmother had never said those words to my mother. It's not that my grandmother never told anyone she loved them, she just didn't tell my mother. In her family, my mother had been the one child singled out for abuse and she hadn't lived a very happy life. It was the closure my mother needed and she now knows that she was loved, although it took me many years to come to terms with her death. For the longest time I believed she died because of me. If I wouldn't have brought my son to visit her, she wouldn't have seen him and she wouldn't have died. But I know realize it wasn't my fault, it was her time.

A Christmas Wish,"Massachusetts, United States",Family / Friends Visits,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Family / Friends Visits :: A Christmas Wish

I know there's life after death, I know sprits are real, and I believe if you are receptive, things will happen. It's a beautiful thing and I only wish it would happen more often to me! I've always been fascinated with anything of a spiritual nature and have dabbled in Astral projection, had some great luck with the Ouija board, and have dreams that feel like ""visits"".

I lost my Mom 12 years ago, when I was 26 years old, from a very aggressive brain tumor that killed her 3 weeks after her fist symptom. We were very close, like sisters, and when she passed away I suffered greatly. I still cry in my sleep sometimes. She was only 48 years old, and because I lost my Dad at 15, I felt very much like an orphan when she left me. I totally relied on her for support in every way.

Mom died in March that year. Our first Christmas without her, I went ""home"" for the holiday to spend Christmas Eve with my Grandmother, my Mom's Mom. Before I went to her house, I stopped at the cemetery to visit my Mom's grave. It was a cold snowy day in Massachusetts and I was feeling very sad, lonely, and depressed, still grieving. I stood at her gravesite and told Mom how much I missed her and how much I needed to know she was watching over me. I asked her if she could give me a sign, or let me just see her one more time. I really needed that. I was standing there, sobbing, looking off in the distance hoping to see her. Or hear her - something. Nothing happened.

I got in the car and drove down the road to my grandmother's. It was early afternoon and we didn't need to be at my Uncle's house for a few more hours so I laid down on the bed and rested while my grandmother sat on the couch, in the same room. We were both having a tough time, being the first Christmas without her, but neither of us wanted to talk about it. I didn't even tell her I went to the Cemetery because I didn't want to make her cry.

Suddenly - the TV across the room turned on. By itself! I looked at my Grandmother and she simply smiled and said ""Angels"". I smiled back and said ""Yes, I know"". We were both thinking the same thing but that was the extent of our conversation. The TV is fine, it had never done anything like that before, and the remote control was on a table no where near us. That was the sign I asked for, and Mom delivered. It felt very special and it had a soothing effect on me for rest of the Christmas season. This may not sound all that profound, but it really did have a huge impact on me.

I am also visited by my Mother regularly in my dreams and I truly believe this is her way to keep in touch with me and just to generally let me know that she's around. She came to me again in a dream a few months ago.

I usually dream of her in the house I grew up in, but this time it was in my house, which we bought 4 years ago. I was in my kitchen trying to call the dog to let him out, and the dog kept looking behind him and didn't want to come down to the bottom of the stairs. I kept calling for him, and FINALY he walked down the stairs. And Mom walked down right behind him! I ran across the room and threw my arms around her and gave her the biggest hug! I cried and I said - ""MOM - You're here?""

Thanks Mom. I still miss you more than you know, and I'll never forget all of the memories we've shared. Merry Christmas!

Dark Red Reptilian Face,United Kingdom,Ouija Board / Seances,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Ouija Board / Seances :: Dark Red Reptilian Face

R ecently I used a Ouija board and yes I know I'm always telling everyone not to use them but I'm 13 and I was lured in using peer pressure. I didn't use the board at my house but at my friend's house with three other friends, my four friends wanted to make one using instructions they found on the internet and eventually I gave in thinking nothing was going to happen, sadly I was wrong.

After we had made the ouija board chris went to get a shot glass from downstairs, since there was no-one else in the house there where no questions asked. We started with the normal questions like, is there anyone here, yes, are you male or female, female, how long have you been in this house, fifteen years, then my extremely immature friend shaun started asking stupid and offensive questions that I won't repeat on this web site.

To cut a long story short the ghost got extremely angry with us she threw the glass straight at my chest where it shattered into very sharp and tiny fragments (luckily I had quite a thick coat on since it was so cold in the room) but a couple of shards got stuck in my chest and I needed stitches.

Then all of the doors in the house crashed open and we fled outside as fast as we could, but because of my bad luck me and chris had left our phones in his room so we had to go back in, and besides I needed to do something with the glass in my chest, whilst I was in the kitchen removing the two shards of glass and bandaging my cuts, chris went to get the phones.

Then I heard chris scream at the top of his lungs so I half ran Half stumbled upstairs but just as I reached his room the door slammed shut and the doorknob was stuck in its position, when I wrenched it open he was cowering on his bed shivering and muttering to himself, when I had calmed him down, he told me that he'd seen a demon and described it as a dark red reptilian face with fiery eyes and black horns.

No-one believed us so I had to say we were drunk and I fell over on the glass.

Haunted Dorm Bathroom,"Missouri, United States",Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: Haunted Dorm Bathroom

I am currently attending a college in the southern part of Missouri. I have heard many ghost stories about dorms. Before my incident I really had not heard any of the rumors about my dorm so it's not like I was really freaking myself out or anything. It was about a month into the first semester of my freshman year and my dorm is a freshman dorm. It is also one of the older ones. So obviously it full of hyper first year college students that are excited about their newly found freedom.

It was about 2AM and my dorm has a community bathroom. It had about 6 bathroom stalls and about 5-6 shower stalls. I had been awoken by whoever was above my room because they are always bouncing a basketball or moving their furniture around. So I decided to get up and use the bathroom. I went down the hall and was proceeding to do my business in one of the stalls. There was no one else in the bathroom but me. The door to the bathroom is really loud so I would have known if someone had came in after me. All of a sudden I hear someone run really fast in front of the bathroom stalls and into the handicap stall at the end of the row. Then I hear a burst of whispers. It sounded like a hundred people were whispering all at once. I freaked out and left the bathroom as soon as I could. I didn't tell my roommate until later because I really didn't want to freak her out.

The next night I was awoken again by the people that lived above my room. This had happened probably 4 or 5 times a week since I had been down at school. That night I was basically pissed because I was so tired of it happening. The next day I went downstairs to talk to the hall director (the boss of my dorm) about it. I told him I was just so tired of being woken up almost every night. I told him that I didn't want to get anyone in trouble it was just starting to get ridiculous.

The sounds kept continuing and I just tried to ignore them since the hall director said he would take care of it. Finally it was about two weeks later and nothing stopped. So I went back downstairs and asked if he had talked to the room above me. He told me this statement: I do not know how to say this but no one lives in that room. It is for special needs people and we do not have any living in our dorm this year.

I was shocked! I asked him if anyone had a key to the room and he said no. He was the only one that did and the last time he was in there was the last summer.

Until my last day in that room the noises continued but no one was there.

Unwanted Party Guest,Australia,Poltergeists / Physical Manifestations,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Poltergeists / Physical Manifestations :: Unwanted Party Guest

I was invited to a party one Saturday night. Just a couple of friends getting together for a few drinks and just to have a good time, that's all I was told about the party. The party was to take place at Beaudesert, Queensland, just outside of Brisbane, Australia. I arrived at the party to find out it was already under way. The party was on a property of about 50 acres or more, not too sure exactly. It was used as a cattle farm, and years ago a few farmhands stayed on the property in a sort of cottage about 200 meters from the main house. This cottage was the scene of this party. So I walk down to the cottage and as I pass the gate into the yard for the cottage a feel a chill but there is no breeze blowing. Not thinking anything of it I carry on. I arrive to the party and see it has kicked off well.

I decided not to drink as I was underage and I didn't feel like drinking at all. About an hour into the party we go down to another abandoned cottage and I notice there are several graves in front of this cottage. I ask about it and my friend, Terry, tells me that four people got murdered in there and it is now haunted. I would just like to point out that before this experience I didn't believe in ghosts, but know it's a different story.

We head back to the cottage we were staying in and put on some music. We just started to getting into the music when I asked, jokingly, if this cottage was haunted. Terry tells me that a farmhand, about 40 rears old, was murdered in here and has been spotted in here before. At that exact moment, after she finishes telling me this, the stereo turns off. I check the power and it is still plugged in. Then the furniture starts shifting by itself, one particular chair is spinning around at a dizzying speed. Then the fridge door and pantry door start opening and slamming shut with such speed and force that it shakes the walls. We all just ran outside screaming. When I was outside I looked into the window and I swear I saw a face glaring at us.

Since this experience I am a firm believer in ghosts and the science behind them. I am trying to start a ghost hunting group so I can understand more about them. As I mentioned earlier I wasn't drinking so I couldn't have just imagined this as all of my friends were present as well and they all experienced the same time I did. Later I asked them if felt the air get colder as they entered the yard and they all said yes.

Ghosts of my Life,"California, United States",A Haunted Life,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: A Haunted Life :: Ghosts of my Life

G rowing up has been un-easy... When I was 5 years old my family and I rented a house in the San Fernando Valley. It was nice the first time I had my own room. It was the 3rd day living in the house. It was time for me to go to bed, so I did leaving my bed room door open just in case I wanted to go sleep with my parents. I was just sitting in bed waiting for me to get sleepy. I don't know why but I just had to look up and look at the door.

Right there under the door way was the figure of a little boy. He appeared to be glowing white. And he was just looking at me. At this moment I couldn't scream. I was just frozen. I couldn't run so I did the 3rd thing that popped into my head. I laid down and pulled my covers over my face and held them tightly with my eyes shut. I guess sometime after I drifted off to sleep. The next morning I woke up and ran into my brother's bedroom waking him up. I told him of what I seen and he said it was just my imagination. I told my parents and they said the same thing. I was mad at the fact that they didn't believe me. Being so afraid of what happened I decided never to sleep in that room again. I shared rooms with my brother.

Eventually we rented out the bedroom to a woman with her child. But soon afterward we moved out to an apartment building in Canoga Park. The apartment had only 2 bedrooms so I was still sharing a room with my brother. I was relieved that we had moved out of the house. Everything was good until one night in my parents bed while my mom was asleep, I woke up and looked around. I couldn't go back to sleep so I just laid there. After some time I decided to sit up and right when I did I felt the feeling as if someone was watching me so I looked around and right in one corner of the bedroom with barely any moon light, I saw the shadow of a tall man wearing a hat. Again I couldn't scream and wake up my mom who was sound asleep beside me. I was frozen with fright. I just rushed and grabbed the cover pulled it over my face and closed my eyes...

The next morning I woke up and told my mom of the dark shadow figured man with the hat. And of course she didn't believe me. I knew it wasn't my imagination, I knew that what I had seen was real and it had been a ghost. I never saw the tall man again since that night. And nothing strange ever happened in the bedroom I shared with my brother...

Once again my family and I moved out to another apartment building in Laurel Canyon. I was 8 at the time we moved. And I had never forgotten what I had experienced. Again I shared rooms with my brother. And nothing happened until months later when I was alone at home. I was playing with my barbies and I went to the kitchen to get something to drink. When I came back to my room I started to feel weird and scared. It felt as if someone was watching me again. I looked around but I didn't see anything. And this continued on. I always felt it everywhere I went, if I walked through the hall-way I always had to look behind me. When I went to the bathroom I was so scared of being alone in there. So I began to leave the bathroom door open when ever I went to the restroom or took a shower. Everyone thought I was just being stupid. My mom would always tell me there's no such thing as ghosts and if you believe in god nothing will ever happen to you.

Now we live in are very own house in Palmdale for about 8 years now and here's where my paranormal incidents happen the most. I've heard weird noises like footsteps going through the hall-way, doors opening and closing when I'm home alone, Light's turning on and off by them selves, and the living room tv turning on by it self when there's no one in the living room. Bangs on the windows in my room and in my parents bedroom.

I've only witnessed the bangs in my bedroom window. But my brother has witnessed the one in my parents room. He says that he was laying down on my parents bed watching tv when out of all of a sudden a loud hard bang came from the window. He jumped and looked at the window and saw nothing. He went outside to the back yard to my parents window to see if there was a ball or anything that could have made it. But nothing. And the ones in my bed room have happened during the day and in the middle of the night while I'm sleeping. The chandelier swinging back and forth in are living room.

And of course more ghosts. Like all teenagers I would always be locked up in my room doing homework, listening to music, reading books, etc. And I started to get the feeling that I was alone but I never saw anything. One day in my room while at my desk I felt like someone was behind me so I turned but nothing. I went back to reading, then I felt someone touched me. I turned around and nothing. Then I got up and went to my bed. And it happened again. Someone touched me but this time it was my cheek. It felt like a little kids hand.

It would happen all the time in my bed room. But I soon got used to it. And it never scared me anymore. Then some time after I began to hear a woman's voice saying my name when I would be in my room. At first I thought it was my mom. My mom would always call for me to come and help her. So when I would hear it I would go out to my mom and ask her what did she need. And she would say ""I didn't call for you"" and I would say ""yes, I heard you say my name"". It started to happen more and more often. I thought it was really weird. If it wasn't my mom saying my name then who?

So I began to investigate. Every time it happened I was in my room, no were else. So I waited for the day when I would be able to hear from where it was coming from. And that day did come. I was in my room listening to music and it wasn't loud at all. And I heard the woman's voice say my name. I turned my stereo off. And just stood there listening. I heard it again and it sounded like it was outside my room. So I walked and opened my door I looked out into the hallway and nothing. And just then I heard it again but coming from inside my room behind me. I just freaked out and ran to where my mom was. I told her what happened, I believe that's the day my mom started believing me. She told my dad and brother but they didn't believe me. They said ""how come we haven't seen anything or heard anything and you have"" and my response was ""I don't know"".

I was so angry at the fact that they hadn't seen or heard anything. Why did it always happen to me. Why was I the only one. I began to ask these questions to myself everyday...

More time passed and more incidents. Once I was taking a shower in my parents bath room. And it's those showers with the sliding door that is blurry. Well I was washing my hair off and I happened to open my eyes. And out of the corner of my eye I saw a figure behind the sliding shower door, I got scared, when I looked again there was no body. And the bathroom door was locked. It had looked like a little boy from how short the person was and they seemed to be wearing a blue shirt and blue jeans with brown hair. I told my mom of the incident, all she could say was ""just believe in god"".

The ghost in my bedroom who touched me was proved to be a little girl. I was walking past the hall-way one day going straight to the kitchen when I saw something out of the corner of my eye. I stopped and turned and saw a little girl in a white dress with light brown curly hair smiling at me. I just smiled back and walked away. I guess she liked me and spent her time in my room because of all my girly things...

Now of the little boy I never saw him again but just recently before thanksgiving. It was around 8:00pm I believe. I was in the living and my mom was sitting at the kitchen table. I walked up to turn off the tv. Just as I was turning around I heard the sound of a person crying. I got scared and stopped. And I was thinking to my self did my mom happen to hear it to or just me. I walked slowly towards her and she looked straight at me. I asked her ""if she heard it"" and she responded ""yes"". Then she said it sounded like it was coming from behind me. We both agreed it was the voice of a little boy crying...

The woman who would call my name was proven to be a family member who passed away. She was here to take care of me. I really don't know why. Supposedly ghost come to me because they want help. And I need to try and listen to what there trying to say to me. So I guess this won't be the last of any ghost for me. I still get scared sometimes but then again I enjoy being able to tell my experiences to other people. And I love reading and hearing other peoples stories...

My First Encounter,Philippines,Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: My First Encounter

I still remember up to now; I was about 4 or 5 when my first encounter with a ""white lady"" happened. Our house in the philippines was a 3 story house. And it's kind of old. My grandmother even told me that it's been there when my mom was still a baby.

I needed to go to the bathroom so bad but our lights in the hallway was all closed. I was going to go downstairs but then I couldn't help it anymore. So when I was about to close the lights, and I was about to step out of the bathroom, the bathroom behind me seemed like the lights turned on again. But I was sure that I turned it off. And when I try to look back, there was a girl wearing white and her hair was covering her face. I could only see her eyes. And she had sharp nails. The lady was about to put her sharp hands on my shoulders when I started screaming and went back to our room.

I told my mom about it but as all parents tell little kids, she said that it must have just been my imagination. When I asked my great grand mother the next day, she told me that I just have to get used to it because of the oldness of our house. She also said that it was probably that japanese girl looking for her daughter. She told me that, before they bought the house long time ago, which was around the time of the Japanese people in our country, she said that the land lord already told her about a pregnant Japanese lady who died in that house.

My great grand mother also mentioned that she always sees this girl. She said that the girl doesn't harm anyone. As I grew up, I saw the same lady a couple of times but I never dared to go near her or even try to talk to her. I don't think I can do that yet.

The Doppleganger at Tagaytay,Philippines,Apparitions / Voices / Touches,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Apparitions / Voices / Touches :: The Doppleganger at Tagaytay

N ow that I live in United States, I only go back and visit Philippines. One of my vacations over there, we went to Tagaytay. We have a rest house over there and we have someone who takes care of it. My grandmother, my maid, my uncle, mom, brother and 4 cousins and 2 aunties were with us. All of them wanted to go swimming right when we got there, but I needed to get ready still. I told them they can go already and I'll just follow them.

It was only me and my own maid left inside the house. I call her Yaya. I couldn't find my bathing suit so then I asked her. But she just kept walking around the house and acting like she couldn't hear me. When I found my suit, I went where others were and I saw my yaya in the pool already. But I could've sworn that she was still in the house wearing pants and a tank top. But she was already in the pool wearing her swimsuit. I realized it's really impossible for her to get dress that quick. When I asked her, ""weren't you just inside? You wouldn't even listen to me"" and then she told me that she was the very first one to go outside the house. But I was sure about who I saw inside.

I just ignored that incident, but when I was reading a book, it mentioned about a ""doppleganger  "" the description that was on the book was that, these dopplegangers copy people's faces and they wear different clothes. And they show up for a little while and they disappear.

Honestly, I don't know how this is related to my story, but I know that, that was what happened to me at Tagaytay. Does anyone know or had the same experience that I did? If so, I really need your help. Thank you !

Strange Knocks,"Florida, United States",Poltergeists / Physical Manifestations,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Poltergeists / Physical Manifestations :: Strange Knocks

I am writing this on the basis that I really need some help. Since October I have been hearing knocks all around my house, it started one night, about 1am, I was having a hard time falling asleep so I went to watch tv. I'm sitting on the couch channel surfing and I heard someone call me from my room. I go to my room and asked my husband what he needed but he was out so I blew it off as me being so sleepy.

About two weeks later I heard knocks under the house, but I dismissed it as neighborhood cats under the house. Well a little while after the ""cats under the house"" I went to bed and thought nothing of it until I heard 3 really loud bangs on my front door so I went to get a golf club and see who was at the door. When I got there, nobody, so I start to look around the house and down the road, nothing there. Well it stopped for a while after that night then shortly before Thanksgiving I was home alone and getting ready to take a shower and on the bathroom door, I heard bang, bang, bang, maybe Tim came home early and was letting me know he was home. I poked my head out of the door no one was there so I yelled ""Tim what are you doing home so soon?"", I got no response. I was thoroughly freaked out.

Nothing happened after that until last Friday when my mom came over to see the kids and me, as I'm getting ready to go she yells at me and says someone was at the door so I went to answer nobody was there, my poor mom about had a stroke over the whole story. She was very mad at me for not telling her but, I needed to make sure that it wasn't just me. So I have been just sitting back and observing and trying figure out what exactly what is going on.

This is the only time beside telling my mom that I have spoken of these incidents. I really need help with what is going on mainly I don't feel anything good or bad just strange things going on, and as to date I have not seen any thing. I do know it is not the house settling that is a totally different sound.

My Brother's Death,"New York, United States",Family / Friends Visits,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Family / Friends Visits :: My Brother's Death

M y brother's name is Jay. He died when he was 14 years old. He died of bone cancer. I have seen and heard his spirit many times. When I was about 2 years old, I heard a voice say ""Watch Out"" in a spooky voice. The next second, I was flying through the air. I got hit by a car. There was no one around to say ""Watch out"" so it couldn't have been my dad or a neighbor.

Another time was when a rock was flying towards the back of my head. Before it could hit me, something pushed me down and it missed. No one was behind me when I looked. I noticed something really weird. Whenever I am about to get hurt, I hear the same teenaged voice. When I turned 9 years old I figured it out. My brother's ghost was out there to protect me. I am very grateful and very scared. I am grateful because the brother that I never knew is kind of like my guardian angel. I am scared because I am dealing with a ghost.

Every now and then I hear voices but I am not afraid. This is because I have a wonderful brother. Even as a ghost he will do anything to protect me. For that, I am grateful. I love my brother Jay and nothing can ever change that. When I grow old and die, I hope to be in heaven peacefully with my brother and my family.

I need your help. Can you comment on my story telling me if I can trust this ghost. Thanks.

Northern Ireland Haunting,United Kingdom,Old Hags / Night Attacks / Sleep Paralysis,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Old Hags / Night Attacks / Sleep Paralysis :: Northern Ireland Haunting

H i I have just come across this site and I thought I would submit my experience. Any comments or thoughts about what happened to me are appreciated. First of all the stats, I'm female, 21 year old living just outside of Belfast. I have lived in this house for going on 16 years (it was newly built when we bought it). The only person to actually die in the house would have been my dad and that was about 7 years ago.

My story starts about 4 years ago around july/aug time on a saturday morning. I was woken up at 6 ish by something pressing on my chest, this continued to happen for six more sats in a row always around 6 ish, I would be so freaked out I would leave the room. This continued until one saturday when I was so tired I actually got a little bit annoyed and refused to leave the room, instead trying to get back to sleep again. I had just started to doze off when I felt it pressing on my chest again only harder, in fact I had difficulty breathing until I actually got up out of bed and left the room.

I decided I was going to change bedrooms so I moved across the landing to the spare room. Whilst staying in this room I would hear breathing, always when I was lying down in bed almost as if someone was kneeling down by the side of the bed right beside my head (even when I held my own breath I could still hear breathing). I slept in that room for about a month with this happening on most nights. I eventually decided to move back into my own bedroom again and this is where it became more active.

One saturday (I know it always seems to happen on sats!) I was in my bedroom with my girlfriend, we had been just messing around and chatting, I left her for 30 minutes to go and get lunch for us (it's a local garage), when I came back she was sitting down stairs saying that the computer chair had started moving by itself and that she had heard whispering. We eventually went back up bringing juice with us in two glasses and saturday them on the window cill. We had been in the room a while when both glasses fell behind my bed (the head of the bed was in front of the window). I grabbed a cloth to clean up the mess thinking that it will have spilled but when I looked behind the bed the glasses had both landed the right way up without spilling any of their content.

Another time when I was in my bedroom on my own a can of body spray was thrown across my bedroom by nothing, followed about half an hour later by a more or less full 2 litre bottle of coke. Also I would wake up some nights with the feeling of someone's arm under my head when I was totally alone in the bed. Other nights I would feel the bed sag as if someone had sat on it again when I was the only person there.

I could also hear whispering coming from the corner of the room but I could never make out what it was saying. I no longer liked staying on my own in the house, I felt constantly watched and very uncomfortable.

Move to oct, it was around 7pm and I was walking down my hall to the kitchen (the hall is an L shape), I just rounded the corner and I saw a gray figure coming from the other direction, it had no features just a human shape and its form was wispy. Unfortunately I was terrified and ran back into the living room where my mother was sitting, I didn't wait to find out where it was going. My girlfriend also saw this wispy form once at the top of the stairs but it was less formed.

Now for the bathroom. I hated hated hated this room... Taps would turn on full blast for no reason. I could no longer take a shower in that room with out someone coming in with me, I always felt that someone was standing by the toilet watching me and even at one point when I walked by the bathroom I would see a black tall shadow standing in that area. This shadow actually followed me while I was on holiday in the Republic of Ireland. In fact one night I heard something calling my name (my girlfriend heard it too).

I along with a friend have heard my mother calling me (as if she was angry with me) and when I have asked her what she's yelling at she has told me that she didn't call me. A number of things like that happened to me over the next two years.

Then it all seemed to come to a head, I was going through a break up with my girlfriend and feeling quite down at the time. I woke up one night feeling something holding me down, I could not move and I could not scream... I was terrified and recited the lord's prayer in my head until the feeling left me (I'm not even a religious person).

This again happened during the day, I went into my mums bedroom for an afternoon nap. I woke up pinned to the bed again not able to move or say anything but his time there was a standing beside the bed as if it were looking at me, it was gray in colour without any features, the outer edge of the figure was hazy and light in colour but as you got into the centre of the figure it became more solid and a darker shade of gray. Size wise it was about the height of a 10 year old boy.

The final thing that happened to my was by far the most frightening. I was still quite scared of sleeping because of the paralysis so I resorted to staying on the sofa at night to be closer to my mum. I was watching tv that night (with the lights on) and I must have fallen asleep. When I woke up I was pinned to the sofa by the unseen force but it was as if either the sofa was shaking or the whole room was vibrating and there was a loud static noise with what I can only describe as a cat's yowl mixed in to it (it still sends shivers down my spine and brings tears to my eyes just thinking about it). I could feel something touching me in inappropriate places, it may have only lasted for a minute at the most then it just stopped and I was able to get up of the sofa and scream for my mum. From that happened the hauntings have more or less stopped in my house, apart from the odd thing.

There seems to be a lot of people on here who know what they are talking about. What I'm most interested in is an explanation for the last thing that happened to me, I know it sounds very far fetched but I know what happened to me and I know I was awake when it happened.

I'm sorry about the length of the story but I felt that in order for you to understand the build up of activity that I should try to include as much detail as possible.

A Ghost is Provoking Accidents,Canada,Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: A Ghost is Provoking Accidents

L ately I have been getting hurt... a lot. I am not a klutz or anything, I know my accidents don't 'just happen'. Maybe I am getting paranoid and going crazy but I swear that there is something weird in this house messing with me.

I live in a tiny house and the people who lived here before (who were my boyfriend's aunt and uncle) both passed away, however not in the house. My boyfriend's mom thinks that the uncle is looking for the aunt and is still in the house. I thought that hauntings mostly happened in big houses but this place is tiny and practically everyone has seen something. My boyfriend's uncle likes to be seen sometimes, but he is very nice, which is why I think there is something else as well as him.

At least a few times a week I will be looking through the fridge only to stand up and crack my head on a cupboard door that wasn't open 10 seconds before. I have a soft spot from hitting my head so much because these things happen out of no where! The cupboard doors even have a hatch so that you need to pull them open they don't just fall open. Also I will be walking in the kitchen and the microwave door will pop open randomly and smack me in the face. I always have bruises all over my face.

Another thing that happened recently was there was a big snow storm and then the next day there was a rain storm and the towns water got contaminated. We couldn't drink any of it unless we boiled it first. Well the thing about the house is sometimes I will feel this cold that comes out of no where. I know it can't be my boyfriend's uncle because I always feel calm around him but this cold makes me so nervous that a lot of times when I feel it I will get sick. This happened and I was throwing up so I went to boil water so I would have some to drink if it happened again and I got sick. When the kettle finished I went to pour it out into a jug so I could cool it in the fridge. When I was pouring it, I felt the cold around my hand then something jerked my hand and the lid on the kettle like pulled off and I ended up burning my hand so bad I had to have it bandaged for like 2 weeks.

I also slip in the shower a lot. I will be washing my face and slip on the bar of soap which is always on the shelf. I know it could be coincidence but the soap wouldn't just fall off the shelf by it self like every other time I shower.

I could tell you the rest of the stuff that happens but I would be here all night. Like I said I might just be accident prone but sometimes I get really scared. The oven will get turned on in the night sometimes or I will wake up to the sink overflowing. I have to unplug everything because I am scared it will start a fire.

The worst part of this is that the only other person it happens to is one of my roommates. It doesn't happen to my boyfriend or his girlfriend or anyone else that comes over really.

Attack in my Sleep,"California, United States",Old Hags / Night Attacks / Sleep Paralysis,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Old Hags / Night Attacks / Sleep Paralysis :: Attack in my Sleep

L ast week I returned home from Oak Harbor, WA, where I live happily with my boyfriend, to visit my parents in old camarillo, CA. It's the holidays, so with lots of people in and out of my house, I was naturally a bit tired. I walked upstairs to my old childhood room to catch some zzzz's. I was drifting off, dreaming, or so I thought. I'm afraid, and fighting, I can't remember so much what my dream was about, though trying, that's almost not important. What is important is what I awoke to, my hands being held down, my head demobilized by restraint of an unknown force. My eyes being the only thing I can move, I catch a slight glimpse.

It was a ghost struggling to keep me from seeing its face. I couldn't move, in fact, I couldn't breathe. It took one finger and stabbed into my side which stung like energy shock, a pain I never knew. I finally managed, threw the loud grumblings of this ghost who by now had its hands around my throat and shoulders, to ever so slightly move my head and mutter, ""I can see you"". It was very soft.

Almost as soon as I said it, the experience was over, it was gone along with my fear. Since then my mother has seen the ghost of a man in our house though, I have not since that night. But I do have one long bruise on my side from the finger he dragged against me. It won't seem to go away...

Sick After a Ghost Apparition,Canada,Apparitions / Voices / Touches,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Apparitions / Voices / Touches :: Sick After a Ghost Apparition

A few nights ago, I was sitting up waiting for my mom to come home and around 12 or so, I got bored and went to bed. I had been laying in bed for a while when out of nowhere I felt something sit down on my bed. Since I sleep with my door shut, the hall light on (when I'm alone in my house so I would have noticed if someone had walked by the door because of the shadow that would have been cast), my dog shut in the kitchen, and none of my cats are ever in my house when we go to bed, I was really creeped out.

So like anyone who would be scared, I whipped around in my bed and flicked on my light. Of course, there was nothing there. When my mom eventually did get home (I had my light on the entire time) I told her about it but I don't think she remembers because she was kind of drunk and tired. It felt like a bad presence to me but I brushed it off as best I could.

Then last night I was on the computer talking to my friends on msn when all of a sudden I got really cold. I went to lay down on the couch in the living room. I was laying there in my sleeping bag (it's made for like zero temperatures and it was above zero Celsius in my house) when after around twenty minutes or so, I stopped shivering and went to sleep for a while. When I woke up, I was sweating really bad and could tell I had a fever but outside my sleeping bag it was freezing so I just stayed there and stayed hot. My mouth was dry and I had to go to the washroom so I got up. At this moment I felt like my skin was on fire and I was dizzy and really weak. I nearly fell on our oil stove (it's used for heating our house) and I couldn't seem to get enough to drink. I didn't go to bed until my mom got home that night.

I woke up a bit before five that morning and felt nearly 100% better. Later when I woke up for school (around 7:30) I had a bit of a headache and one of my lip rings had just fallen out which was a little weird. I just put the ring back in and took a pill. I fell that all of these things, the sitting, the sickness, the lip ring, were all connected somehow. If you have any advice to help feel better in my house, it would be a great help.

My Mother Saw a Ghost that Looked like Me,"Colorado, United States",Apparitions / Voices / Touches,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Apparitions / Voices / Touches :: My Mother Saw a Ghost that Looked like Me

I 'm not quite sure if I can be a reincarnation or not. There is a reason why I need to find out. First, years back, my mother woke up before I was about to be born. She claimed she saw an angel at her doorway telling her, ""It's coming..."" Recently, she told me that she also woke up in the middle of the night, seeing a ghost that seemed very similar to me. That ghost told her, ""Be good..."" I have never found out what the ghost's point of view was, but my mother told me it looked like me except all grown up.

Did I die temporarily and then wake up the next day? Could I be a reincarnation to help with something? I have no clue if reincarnations are real. All of this ghost stuff started happening when we moved into another neighborhood about four years back. Of course, a haunted road is near to the neighborhood... It's all so confusing.

I also know that there is this ghost following me around. I feel it with me during my classes because of the sudden chill I get every once in a while in a warm room. I've had some psychic and ghost experiences also. For example, I had a dream that this person had this expression on their face with other details in the dream of course. The day I woke up, it seemed as if I was able to concentrate hard and create that expression on that person's face. I saw the exact expression from the dream.

Everything seems weird to me. I know I only stated random clues, but can you please give me some facts? Thank you tons!

The Haunting On Lad Parkway,"Minnesota, United States",Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: The Haunting On Lad Parkway

W e moved into our house about 2 years ago. And I got the room in the basement, and my cousin got the one next to mine. I was never a believer of ghost, I used to hear stories about hauntings and how people witness events and I used to laugh at it.

A couple months later in December I got real sick with the flu, and I was watching my little cousin deserea. I finally fell asleep when I got this urge to wake up. I looked around and my dad left a note that Hand, my little brother, and cousins, went to our grandma's house, and will be back soon. So I grabbed the clicker and then I heard loud running up the stairs, I looked to see who it was and no one was there. There was no way that was the house settling that was far to loud to be that.

A couple weeks later I got on the phone and someone else was on the phone I said, ""Hello, whose on the phone"", then it slammed down. I ran up to the other phone because maybe it was someone goofing with me, but my mom was cooking in the kitchen. I asked her,""Mom were you just on the phone""? She said, ""no why"". I just walked away.

One morning on January 9th 2007, I had to get up for Doctor appointment. I got into the shower and washed up when the shower hose lifted up and whacked me in the face. Later my brother said that the night before, he heard someone crying in the bathroom. I said maybe it was just the tv and he said ""put it on are grandpa's grave"", he wouldn't do that if it wasn't true.

Later my Dad wanted a family picture so we can give it to our grandparents for their anniversary. We gathered and we did. My mom told my dad that we had to take it back. He said, ""Why"". She said, ""because there's this black cloud, smudge thing over our heads"". I looked and I almost fell over because if you were me, you'd think the same thing, that was no mistake.

But we also have the bed pushed down only in one spot. My movie kept skipping this part that said, ""There's no escaping the Dark side"". Then I was convinced that my house is indeed haunted.

Watauga House Hauntings,"Texas, United States",Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: Watauga House Hauntings

D uring the summer of 2004, I was spending the night at my friend's house and he was in the shower. So his brother and I were watching t.v. and he turned the volume down and said ""Did you hear that?"" I started to listen and I hear a slight laugh coming from the wall to our left. Now on the other side of this wall is a garage, and we were the only ones home.

About a month later, it was about 2:00 am in the morning and I decided to go to bed. As I was walking toward the guest bedroom, I felt a chill run up my spine. I get to the room, climb into bed, and quickly fall asleep. I woke up sweating and breathing hard and all of a sudden I hear a thump come from the bathroom connected to the room. I glance over and I see two red eyes in the darkness that seem to be glaring at me. I high-tailed it out of that room and fell asleep on the couch.

Supposedly before I had met my friend, they had a history with a ""demon"" that followed them wherever they went. They had moved from city to city and this entity followed them. My friend's mother would randomly wake up with scratches on her back and she would see a shadow at the corner of her eye every once in awhile.

Then one day she had enough and she spread holy water all over her house. A few months after that they moved to a house in Fort Worth and I decided to go spend the night for a week. There was no sort of activity going on anymore, they had rid of the ghost.

Light Show in my Bedroom,"Washington, United States",Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: Light Show in my Bedroom

M y brother and I were renting an old house in Longview, WA. This house was apparently built back in the 1920's. My room was in the basement. Well, it basically WAS the basement. All the lights and electrical plugins were on the same circuit controlled from upstairs. Rather than going upstairs to turn the lights out when going to bed, then stumbling down the stairs afterword, I would just unscrew the light bulb above my bed. This way I could leave my computer on and still have an alarm clock.

One night, I unscrewed the light bulb just like every other night. I went to bed and quickly fell asleep. At about 5am, I awoke to a flashing light in my room. I opened my eyes and saw the light bulb which I had unscrewed was turning on and off very fast. I figured someone must be playing with the light switch upstairs but I looked at my computer, and it was on. If someone had been playing with a switch, the computer would have been affected. I laid in bed for several minutes watching the light flick on and off. I didn't feel afraid at all, in fact the only reason I hadn't got up is I was hoping it would stop without me having to get up. Lazy I guess!

Finally, after a period of about 4 or 5 minutes, I got out of bed. As soon as I was standing, the light stopped turning off and on, and just went to fully ON. The light bulb had completely screwed itself back in.

I tried to pass it off as electrical problems, until I remembered what my brother's old roommate had told me before I moved in. He had said that one night he had woke up and saw a shadowy figure standing over him. At this point, I was too awake to sleep any longer so I got up. I went upstairs and watched a movie. When my brother got up, I told him about the light show. He told me that everyone that had lived down in the basement except for him had had an experience of some sort. Some just had gut feelings, others like me had seen something unexplainable.

I talked to several friends about it and ended up talking to my girlfriend's mom (of all people) about it. I was in the middle of my story when her friend came over (who was supposedly psychic). I had met this woman once before, and barely knew her name. She knew very little of me, too. She asked what my girlfriend's mom and I were talking about. My girlfriend's mom told her I had had a light show. She stared at me for several seconds and got visibly upset. She said somewhat franticly, ""It's trying to tell you you're going to have a bad accident...""

She looked at my girlfriend and said, ""Does he drive fast?"" To which my girlfriend replied, ""Yeah, kind of...""

She got more upset and said, ""You need to slow down! It's trying to tell you you're going to have a bad accident!"" She paused for a second while staring at me some more, then said, ""But you won't get hurt. Someone else will...""

I didn't know what to believe. I wanted to think the woman was a quack, but then... How did she know I drive fast? Even my girlfriend's mom didn't know my driving habits. I thought about this for some time, and decided to take things a little more carefully for awhile.

A couple weeks later, a spring pack came apart on the rear axle of my lifted jeep wrangler. The center pin had snapped and some of the leaf springs actually came out on the road! Just a tiny piece of the center pin kept the axle for flipping around and causing an accident. If I hadn't been taking things easy, bad things could certainly have happened.

Ever since I moved into this place, I would hear footsteps upstairs when no one else was home. This happened to be a duplex, so I would just pass it off as being the neighbors somehow. But after this experience, I paid more attention to the footsteps and determined they don't come from the neighbors' side of the house. They come from directly above me. All the other people that had lived there have heard these footsteps.

Too Real to Just Be Sleep Paralysis,"Pennsylvania, United States",Old Hags / Night Attacks / Sleep Paralysis,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Old Hags / Night Attacks / Sleep Paralysis :: Too Real to Just Be Sleep Paralysis

F irst, I would like to start with a simple background of the town I live in. I live in a small town in PA called Skippack. It is a known fact that George Washington and his troops marched down the streets of this town on their way to Valley Forge. Along the way, many soldiers died. In a barn only a few miles from my house is where George Washington stayed a night during his long journey. There are TONS of reported hauntings in this area. I also have heard that when the soldiers would die they would simply bury them in unmarked graves.

My story begins with a common phenomenon called sleep paralysis. Basically, I want to explain to you why I know this is not a dream. It will start when I am really tired and usually when I first fall asleep. I personally believe that being really tired means that my mind is not thinking of anything when I fall asleep, leaving room for my brain to possibly pick up on paranormal activity. It starts when I hear a loud whispering noise in my ear... I always know that I need to get out of this now or I will be screwed. If I can't snap myself out of it, when I open my eyes, everything looks red.

First of all, I do not think you can dream in color. I make a point to try to look around the room and see if things will look the same when I am finished with the experience (if my blinds are up or down, the clock to see the time) I try to escape the experience by trying to sit up, but I cannot move, I feel like there is something right behind me staring at me while I am being paralyzed. I will try to scream and all I can seem to do is make a faint whisper. I feel scared stiff. Sometimes I can hear screams or phrases being repeated over and over such as ""I am back"" or an evil laughing. Most of the time I just hear a loud breathing.

In one of these experiences I remembered looking at the clock and seeing that it was 3:02am. When the experience was over it was 3:05, so I know that at least my eyes were open. Usually after about a minute I gather enough strength to force myself to move and I will jump up out of this. I have learned that if I go right back to sleep I fall right back into this same experience, so normally, I turn a light on and keep myself awake for 5-10 minutes. Usually this helps. There was one time in particular where I could not fight my way out of this. After what seemed to be a long period of time I started to hear a name come to me. I ended up typing it on my computer, but it was strange, the entire thing is fuzzy. I thought I wrote it down, but I didn't remember until later in the day and the memory of it was very faint. I tried looking for it and couldn't find it. I remember it was a strange name and for some reason I think it started with an M.

Another fact that adds to my argument against it being sleep paralysis is that I go to college in Massachusetts and I live in PA. I ONLY get these dreams when I am in my room in PA when my blind is open and there is no light on in the room. I have never had this experience at school, but every time I come home it happens and it happens more than once. If this was something that just happened to me because of medical or scientific reasons, wouldn't this happen to me anywhere that I slept?

It just all seems too real. I am very fascinated by the paranormal and I truly believe it after this has happened to me. The fact that it is a dream, just doesn't make sense to me.

Attacked by a Ghost,"Illinois, United States",Old Hags / Night Attacks / Sleep Paralysis,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Old Hags / Night Attacks / Sleep Paralysis :: Attacked by a Ghost

I t was the middle of the night, 3am and I'm not sure why I awoke. I turned the TV on to pass some time and suddenly got a headache and felt sick to my stomach. I ran to the bathroom to get sick. I just wanted to lay down and sleep at that point so I turned off the TV and went back to bed.

As I was on the verge of sleep, I heard a low level frequency sound in my left ear followed by a whisper. I opened my eyes and above me, I saw a shadow. The shadow began to attack me. It came after my head and chest area and each time it hit, it would resound through my body. I began to shake, like I was having a seizure. I turned my head to try and yell for my daughter who was sleeping in the next room. No matter how hard I tried, I could not produce any sounds. I tried to tell it to go away, but nothing would come out. Finally, it left, the whole thing happened within a couple of minutes.

This has never happened to me before and I live in a new house.

I was more freaked out than anything and have since taken a few precautions and have a couple of prayers that were recommended to me to say nightly, psalms 71 and 91. It has been 4 nights since the attack. Hopefully it is over now, but the help that I seek advised that the entity is probably just waiting for me to let my guard down. I will pray that is not the case. It really felt like it was trying to get inside my body.

My Cousin's Guardian Ghost,India,Children Who See Spirits,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Children Who See Spirits :: My Cousin's Guardian Ghost

T his happened to my uncle's family a year ago. My uncle was a businessman (now he had left his job) and he had all sorts of relations with people. Some were his true friends while some others were the untrustworthy ones. He had a son and a daughter who was blind and deaf by birth. She had never seen her own parents or ever heard their voices, yet she was adored by everyone in the family.

There was a guy, named Shivraj - one of my uncle's true friends. My uncle thought that he was so faithful that he could never cheat on him. But it was one of the biggest mistakes that my uncle thought of him like that (He was worldly-minded and the aim of his life was just money, money and money. My uncle realized this when he lost his son because of his greed for money). The story was something like this...

One day my cousin, i.e. My uncle's son, was playing outside. Just then Shivraj saw him (I'm not sure what really had happened. It's just a guess). My cousin was kidnapped for ransom. Mr. Shivraj was the culprit. He was behind the property that my uncle was owning.

We all were shattered when after 2 or 3 days, we came across the news that my cousin was no more. He was murdered and the murderer was Shivraj (God knows why he did that). My uncle-aunt were broken. But they were unaware about the deceitful plans of brutal Shivraj.

A month passed. The matter was settled. Uncle-aunt somehow managed to cope up with the loss. Everything was fine. But then, strange things began to happen. We noticed that their daughter began to smile at herself. She clapped as if she was seeing something. She showed very strange behavior. One day, my aunt even caught her holding a pencil in her hands and writing something. She was amazed. We also heard her saying ""Mummy-Daddy"" very often which she had never heard before. Uncle thought that she was recovering her weaknesses but she was seeing the spirit of her brother - that's what my grand mom said.

The most freaky incident took place when my uncle was going to sign a deal with Shivraj. It happened when his daughter came to knew that her dad was signing a deal with Shivraj. She just cried aloud and started shouting. All were confused. Just then she took a marker out of the cupboard and wrote on the wall, ""Don't go father... He will murder you just what he did to me"". Out of horror and bewilderment, he didn't go. He was saved by his daughter rather his son (that's what I feel).

Today also, we all believe that his soul lives in their house and protects everyone from difficulties and sometimes makes his sister possessed just to have some fun. Thank you all for reading this lengthy story and I have some more to share.

Haunted Dorm at Eastern Michigan University,"Michigan, United States",Poltergeists / Physical Manifestations,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Poltergeists / Physical Manifestations :: Haunted Dorm at Eastern Michigan University

I am currently a freshman at Eastern Michigan University, which is only about an hour or less away from Detroit. My room mate and I live in a freshman dorm - I am not sure how old it is in comparison to the others, but it is definitely not a new building, and I never really thought anything of it. I moved in first and lived by myself for at least a week back in August, and nothing unusual happened. I never heard any strange noises or discovered cold spots, nor did I feel uncomfortable. In fact, I absolutely loved living there.

A month or so after school started, my puppy died. My parents took me home so I could say goodbye before we took her body in to the vet. I took her collar with me to college and clasped it around my bed (we have bunk beds) and honestly, I was so upset that I had a hard time making it to classes and spent most of my day sleeping. Eventually, I wasn't so emotional, but that's when things started to change.

It all started on a cold November morning. I had slept in until about 11:00 a.m. To check my e-mail. I closed out of everything and locked the door. My room mate was currently at classes and she wouldn't have returned until about 1:00 p.m. I set my sweat pants on top of my laptop, but took the rest of my clothes with me. There isn't a fan in our bathroom, and the curtain doesn't keep water out very well. However, when I came back into my room, I noticed that my pants weren't where I had put them - they had been folded neatly and placed underneath my desk.

I found this to be odd, but again, I didn't think anything of it. The door had been locked. No one had come in. We didn't have suite mates. I simply assumed that maybe they had fallen off, and, coincidentally, landed under my desk folded neatly, but what was more strange was that Google had been up, and someone had searched ""si4u"". I was slightly creeped out at this point, but the results were in different languages and I didn't see anything particularly eerie about them.

When my room mate returned, I told her what had happened and she searched ""si4u"" as well. She got the same results back. We decided that maybe my sweat pants had just fallen off, but sweat pants can't double click the icon for Firefox, go to Google, and then search ""si4u"" before promptly jumping off the desk to the floor. Shortly after this, I lost internet connection (this is typical), but that particular page worked. We were creeped out by this, so I closed it. Nothing happened for awhile.

Later on that month, just before Thanksgiving break, I was once again alone in the room. My room mate had already left to go home earlier that day, and my dad wasn't going to pick me up until the next morning. I was trying to finish up some homework so that I wouldn't have to worry about it over break, when suddenly I started to hear music. The music sounded as if it was coming from a radio, but it was soft, and at first I couldn't tell if it was coming from my room or someone else's. Then it became loud. It was loud, and it was coming from my room mate's radio/alarm clock. ""Who knew"" by Pink. I went over to her dresser to turn off her alarm clock, but the switch was already on ""off"". My next idea was to unplug it, but one soft tug and the plug was in my hand - my room mate had unplugged it before she left. I thought that maybe there was something wrong with the switch, so I turned it on in hopes that maybe it would shut off, but instead, the music became so loud it was stinging my ears. I took that battery out and it stopped.

The next day I told my room mate not to be surprised if she finds that the battery to her alarm clock is lying on her dresser. I told her that it went off when I was studying and that was the only thing that would make it stop. I assumed that something might have fired wrong or that there was a mishap, but then she said this, ""That's strange. The battery isn't strong enough to power the radio, just the alarm. I thought the radio was broken because it wouldn't turn on unless I had the entire thing plugged into the wall...""

The Ghost of 68 Piermont St,"Massachusetts, United States",Ouija Board / Seances,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Ouija Board / Seances :: The Ghost of 68 Piermont St

I was nine years old and very excited to move into our new home. I finally had my own room! It was only a few months before the excitement became an excitement of a different sorts. Our family of five went to the circus together leaving no one at home all day. We returned to find a round light fixture that usually hung at the bottom of the stairs on the floor, upside down, over in the corner below. It was in perfect condition and actually had two out of three of the screws that bolted in place underneath it. The third screw in the ceiling.

My parents discussed who had a key to the house. My Mom's mother was the only one. They called her to ask if she'd been in the house that day. She had not. They confirmed with her that she knew nothing of the mysteriously place light fixture.

I think we all kept it in our minds and kept our eyes open. I remember I was excited at the idea of the paranormal even at that young age. It didn't take long for my curiosity to be intrigued yet again.

My brother's birthday, September 1982 (the same year), we had family over for cake. All of us children were playing upstairs. My brothers and male cousins in my brothers' bedroom, the girls and I in mine. We were called downstairs for cake and when we returned upstairs my brothers could not get back into their bedroom.

They had called our parents and the adults upstairs to see why the door would not open to discover that the bureau that usually sat against the wall on the left of the door was in fact in front of the door. Right up against the door that opened into the room.

Thinking there had to be an explanation my father and uncle muscled the door open. We checked the windows, they were shut and locked, we looked under the beds there was no one. Did a headcount and everyone was accounted for. They didn't have a bedroom closet to hide in. Yet another mystery.

Things calmed down for a while. We had of course told our friends our ""ghost stories"" and with pride. There were friends who slept over and said the eyes in my mother's wedding picture over our mantel turned red. We had seances with friends and kids from the neighborhood where we would rig baseball trophies to fall and basically play jokes on the kids, the spirit or spirits of our house may have been quietly watching but they were not gone.

It was a few years later when my brother told me that he had been listening to music in his room and heard someone call his name from the bottom of the stairs. He had turned the music down and looked down the stairs to see ""a white floaty thing"" at the bottom of the stairs. Quite frankly I did not believe him. I thought he had been tired and had tired eyes or something.

Maybe a few months later I had been home alone, in my room listening to music and heard my name being called from down the stairs. I lowered my music and looked outside my room a few times and saw nothing. Finally I answered again, convinced I had heard something and I also saw the ""white floaty thing"" at the bottom of the stairs.

Part of me felt and still would feel like I would be interested in interaction with the unknown and communicating with this white floating object but when actually faced with this, as a teenager, I backed into my room, shut the door and sat on my bed with the radio down low staring at my locked bedroom door.

I continued to be intrigued by communication and existence of the life beyond. My friend who had an Ouija board had convinced me to try it. We had made contact with what we believed to be a spirit. We spoke with him often through out our high school years. One of my younger brothers decided to use the Ouija board with his friends. It had become old hat to me so I was not part of the ""conversation"". What I can attest to is what the outcome was from that communication.

My brother and his friends had approached me after hours with the Ouija Board and told me that the Ouija board claimed to be a boy who had died in our house. The spirit could prove this because his body was buried under the fourth floor board back from the front of the house. My brother was looking for permission from me to rip up the corner of the carpet in his room to look under a floor board. Our mother was not home and this somehow left me in charge of such a decision. I had basically told him I would not tell him it was okay, but if he did it I'd like to be there.

They peeled up the corner of the carpet nothing. There was a space behind the slanted roof and straight walls that was empty and not accessible to walk in or even crawl in. They had suggested we put a hole into this wall to see what may or may not have been in that space. Again, I refused to ""okay"" this but subtly encouraged it.

We put a hole in the wall, looked in with a flash light and saw a white material on the floor. We got it out and it turned out to be two boys sized t-shirts. I believed my brothers took the t-shirts to the cemetery and buried them in a shirt box. Nothing occurred in the house after that and we were not able to make contact with any spirits with that Ouija board after that day.

Haunted Dorm Bathroom 2,"Missouri, United States",Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: Haunted Dorm Bathroom 2

H ey guys! It's me again! I told you that I would be back with another fantastic dorm haunting story. I am not saying that I sensitive to spirits but I feel like for being at my school for only a year and a half, two encounters in two different bathrooms is amazing to me!

If you did not read my last story I go to a college in southern Missouri. It is a pretty old school. It has been around since 1919 so you can imagine how many students have lived in its dorms overtime.

I moved from my last dorm into my new dorm. My current dorm is the oldest of all the dorms and was originally a dorm for only girls. It is a pretty nice dorm and I feel very comfortable in it.

About 2 months ago I was washing my face at around midnight (in another community bathroom) and when I pulled my face up from the sink I saw in the reflection of the mirror (the reflection was of the shower stalls) the last shower stall on the right had a dark shadow-like figure in it. There were no feet just a very dark shadow and the light above the shower was blinking off and on rapidly. I was pretty freaked and grabbed my stuff and ran back to my room.

My new roommate this semester gets kind of freaked out by things like this so I didn't tell her.

About a week later, my roommate came back to our room after she went to the bathroom and looked kind of weird. I asked her if she was ok and she said yes. I told her that she could talk to me if something was wrong. I had previously talked to her about my experience in my last dorm so she already knew about that. A few minutes later after we started a movie I told her about what I had seen a few nights before. I was curious to see if she believed me or if she would laugh. She looked at me scared and just said ""I just saw it"".

At that point we were both pretty freaked and just talked about both of our experiences. They were both almost the same.

The next day I went to take a shower. I used the stall next to the ""shadow figure one"" half way hoping whatever it was would come back so that I could maybe see if it was just a shadow from the curtain or something like that.

As I was taking my shower I realized the light next to my shower began doing the blinking off and on thing that it had done before. I was getting a little nervous sort of tried to ignore it. (You need a key to control the lights in our bathroom so it's not like anyone could have messed with them.)

Then all of a sudden all the lights in the bathroom started flipping on and off and no person have been flipping the lights like that even if they had a key. I began to rinse off frantically. I turned my water off and opened the curtain and halfway looked under the ""creepy"" stall. The shadow was back. It was darker and bigger than ever. I grabbed all my stuff as fast as I could and ran. I was partially crying when I got to my room because it just freaked me out so much and my roommate realized what I had done.

We never told anyone else about it on my floor but randomly hear girls talking about the shadow in the shower. We actually hung a sign on the door that says out of order so no one uses it. That is how freaked a lot of the girls are.

On a side note: Since my new dorm use to be a girls only dorm, they used to have what you call I guess a ""floor mother"". She use to go up and down the halls and check to see if their were any boys in the rooms after a certain time and make sure the doors were locked in the middle of the night. Now when there are boys in girls rooms, some people have reported banging on their doors and no one be there at all, not even in the hall. And I have witnessed several times in the middle of the night someone slamming down on the outside of my door handle as if they are making sure it is locked. Sort of freaky!

The Night of the Eclipse,Canada,Family / Friends Visits,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Family / Friends Visits :: The Night of the Eclipse

L ast August, as some may remember, there was a total eclipse of the moon. I am not sure which parts of the world it happened in but I know that it was supposed to happen on the west coast at 3:00 in the morning. My boyfriend and two roommates had all been looking forward to it for a long time because there hadn't been a lunar eclipse in our town since I was in the third grade (I was 19 when this eclipse happened) so we decided to make a night of it and kind of make it a special occasion. We all had the next day off so we had dinner and a few drinks.

At about 1:00 in the morning we left to go for a walk and figure out where we were going to watch from. First we decided to try our roof but once we got up there, we noticed that you couldn't see the moon past the trees, so we all started to climb back down the ladder. Now I am terrified of heights. Once I get up on the roof I am like a caterpillar, I can't stand I just wiggle around. So my boyfriend decided to go down first so he could catch me if I started to panic and fell (which was highly likely). My roommate held the ladder from the top. While I was going down, I looked through the window into our living room (the ladder was in front of the window). On the other side of the room there is another window the same size so they face each other. The curtains on the opposite window were closed and the lights were off.

This is where it gets weird. I stopped because I saw a shadow on the curtains on the other window. At first I thought it was my own shadow but it was so big. So I started to wave one of my arms but the arm on the shadow didn't move! Then I realized that the lights were off so there really couldn't be a shadow from me anyways. I was just staring at it while everyone was trying to talk to me then all of a sudden the shadow raised one of its hands in a fist and then started to walk towards me. It looked like it was walking in slow motion but it was still moving across the room fast. I got so scared I let go of the ladder and fell. I was caught and not hurt but I was so shaken up I started to cry. I went towards the street and then once everyone got there and I said what happened, they said it might be a good idea just to go for a walk and stay out of the house for a while.

We walked to the park watched the eclipse then headed home. Once we got back we were sitting there watching The Colbert Report and all of a sudden one of my roommates turned to my boyfriend and said ""When your uncle was alive did he used to agree with people a lot but then add something to what they said?"" (Weirdest question to ask about the man I know - If anyone has an idea of what this might mean please please let me know). Well my boyfriend looked at her and was like ""Well yeah I guess so. He used to kind of like go ""Oh yeah your right but..."" then add something"". Well my roommate started crying and just got up and left the room.

The next morning her boyfriend (who also lives there) was sitting with us watching tv while she was still asleep. We asked him what her deal was and he told us that she saw a man sitting in the chair next to my boyfriend and he kept interrupting her thoughts. She would think something then she would hear him say ""Oh yeah your right but..."" Then add something. Apparently when she asked my boyfriend that question, the ghost did the same thing but then added something scary which is what made her cry. Apparently she wouldn't even tell her boyfriend what he said. All she would say was that he told her to ask that question and then got really mad when my boyfriend answered.

The Moving Picture,"New York, United States",Family / Friends Visits,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Family / Friends Visits :: The Moving Picture

I wrote other stories about my brother Jay , but I didn't tell this one. It was the late afternoon at about 4:58. I was slowly observing the pictures of my brother and I could have swore I saw one moving. Every time I rubbed my eyes and blinked I could still see his mouth moving and words coming out. His eyes moved and his mouth broke into a smile. I don't think it was my imagination because it repeatedly happened. I was freaked out! In my mind I said, ""Is this for real? Or is it just me?"" I can still remember what it was saying. It said, ""Hi Daniel, do you remember me?"" I almost burst into tears. I was happy yet sad. It was really my brother.

After all these years he let me see him. He looked like a very nice boy. I am very sad that he got leukemia (bone cancer). I thought to myself, ""I will treasure this moment forever..."" I wonder what it would be like if Jay was still alive. He would be 25 years old. He probably would grow up to be a very successful man. I hope to be what my brother could have been. In my dreams I picture that moment. I don't think I will ever forget what happened to me on that day. I just hope that God is taking care of him on this very moment. I also hope that Jay is watching down over me right now.

I hope that you enjoyed this story. Please comment and tell me what I should do to stop being so afraid.

Small Boy Walking Back and Forth,"New York, United States",Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: Small Boy Walking Back and Forth

H ello people, I read a couple of other people's stories and felt that I HAD to tell of my experiences. Ever since I was younger, all I ever heard of is spiritual happenings and what not, I guess it helps to tell you that my parents and grandparents are from the Caribbean.

My mom, my brothers, and I recently moved to a new apartment last christmas eve and I was really excited to have my own room again after more than ten years. So after I got used to slamming my new bedroom door after a couple of days, I left it open one night because it was unbearably hot and the windows weren't helping. Now, my room just happened to be across from the bathroom (not really the best thing in the world), my mom's is on the right of my room and my little brothers' is next to hers and the bathroom, keep this in mind.

So, being as I have problems with sleeping, I was watching tv while laying on my bed and I happened to see a small boy walking back and forth pass my door. I yelled at him thinking it was one of the knuckleheads playing a stupid joke thinking they're being stealthy, but he didn't answer, so I stick my head out of the doorway, and I see the figure walk into their room, I follow it to go beat them up, but they were both asleep with the tv on. I turn it off and left.

Back in my room, I'm watching the tv again and I closed the bathroom door so the light wouldn't bother the others while they slept. I reach for my remote and it isn't where I put it, which happened to be right next to me. So I go looking around the house for it, thinking I'm going crazy, and when I decide to stop, it's back in the same spot.

Now, this isn't the first time it happened, I tracked his movements and he only travels in my brothers' bedroom, my room, and the hallway in between them. I figure he was someone's little brother who lived here before. My baby brother has seen him before as well, saying he thought it was me playing tricks on him, because I always do, but he noticed that I didn't make any noise so knew that it wasn't. I wish I could figure out who lived here before, but I can't because no one lived in the building long enough, and some of the neighbors just happen to be obnoxious.

In Our Mirror,"Indiana, United States",Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: In Our Mirror

I tried to do what my Mom calls an over view on the last story, but I missed a lot of stuff that happened in that house. I told you about the boy who would come out of my closet , but I only just started to tell you about the woman who looked like a man trying to dress up like a woman.

On the first floor of the house was a woman who usually stayed between Papa's bedroom, the bathroom (two doors lead to the bathroom, one in Papa's room and one through the kitchen). Whenever I did something wrong I would have to sit on the couch in the living room until I was ready to say sorry.

After a while of doing this a woman started to sit with me. I can't really describe her face, because it was strange. She looked like a man dressed up with make-up on. She even had a small mustache. She was kind to start, except for her creepy smile. She never said anything, just sat there with me. I started saying sorry pretty fast after that because I couldn't figure out her at all.

We had some people over for a cookout and were in the living room eating when my Aunt kept looking at the t.v. when it was off. I asked her what she was doing and she said she was trying to figure out who's reflection she kept seeing walk in front of the couch. Everyone was sitting down.

When I was taking showers or baths I could see the mirror on the back of one of the bathroom doors. She wasn't there all the time, but she would visit me in the mirror. One day in the fog of the window it said hi. I though Mom was playing with me and told her to quit when I got out. She didn't do it. Mom is pretty big on not lying, so I know she didn't.

After a few times of this I said hi. And finished my shower. The mirror then said ""you can see me"". I tried to just look out the corner of my eye while getting ready by the sink, so all I said was ""yes, but I don't like to"".

I told my Mom and she stormed into the bathroom. She ran the shower for a while and sat on the toilet to wait. The toilet was directly across from the mirror. The mirror told her to leave. We couldn't see it write, just saw the writing when it was done. We do not know how this was done.

My Mom's friend Brenda from work told Mom to give me a pen and a paper and I sat at the dining room table while Mom asked questions and Brenda watched. I got lots of scary answers. The thing did not like either Brenda or Mom and swore at them. Mom and Brenda tried lots of things to get rid of her, but it wasn't until Mom decided to let Brenda and her friends do a house blessing that things got weird.

I had to help with the blessing because I could see the things. We used holy water, salt, burning sage and chanted while walking all through the house. In my room, the boy just hid. He just felt sad. We told the things in the house that if it was good it could stay, if it was bad it had to leave.

When we got to Papa's room a scream started and did not end until we got into the basement. It sounded like we were killing someone. My Dad had to find something upstairs in a hurry for Brenda and he said that someone real strong pushed him up the stairs. When he got a couple steps from the top something yanked his leg out from under him. When Mom ran up to see what happened he was knocked out.

In the basement, the ladies said it was like a meeting place. I forget the word but a place where ghosts can come and go as they pleased. They thought this was how the lady got there. They burned my letter from the man/lady in a crack in the floor and closed that door.

Things stopped for a while after that, but didn't all the way end. Three years after we left that house it is still up for sale. People come and go, but no one stays.

I'll Never Forget You Roy,"Texas, United States",Pets / Animals,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Pets / Animals :: I'll Never Forget You Roy

I t all started when I was 12 or so (I'm 19 now). As a child I had experienced many awful things, such as almost being kidnapped, running away and losing a very loved pet. I was very depressed when my dog, Bailey, died and I became very angry at the world and God as well, I just didn't understand why God would take something so precious to me. I began acting out towards my parents and to my friends and even my teachers, I know it may sound ridiculous to some of you... ""Oh wow this girl's retarded, she's mad at the world just because her dog died..."" But that dog was everything I had, I didn't have many friends in school, and my family would ignore me a lot since I'm the middle child so you get idea.

Of course I got over it but then my other dog died, well he had to be put down (Internal Bleeding) and I couldn't just stand there and watch them euthanize him so I stayed home. Later that night I was in the kitchen, minding my own business, plus doing my homework when I heard a dog barking, and I thought to myself... ""ok... That was weird, it sounded just like Roy"" (dog that got put down) so I open the back door leading to the backyard and look around... I didn't see anything so I turned around to go back inside and to my surprise... There he was, wagging his tail and everything. At this point I thought I was going crazy, but he really was there, I was so happy to see that he looked like he was at peace, and no longer suffering. He stayed for a while (I was crying and saying my good byes and that I'll hopefully see him again) he gets up, walks a little further away, looks back at me, barks, and he disappears.

That was the last time I ever saw him, but every now and then when I get gloomy I hear him bark... And sometimes when I go out for a walk in the night, I'll hear little doggy footsteps as if he's walking with me...

The Girl and Her Scary Dog,United Kingdom,Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: The Girl and Her Scary Dog

M y house is haunted. Both my sister and myself have seen her, she appears in two places, acting out what looks like a story. First she appears in my room. She's with her friend, and a dog/wolf thing. The two human ghosts often hold hands. They play together. But then later at night the boy disappears and the dog gets vicious.

The second place is in my sisters' room. Here this girl is alone. She is crying. I have seen her in both places. My sister has only seen her crying. I don't know why she chose our house, but she did. Maybe she needs help. Maybe it's where she lived. Whenever I see her in my room I am too scared to go near her. I am afraid of the dog. He sits on my draws as if to protect them. When he is vicious he is more like a wolf. They appear most dark nights. Mostly on winter nights when the moon is either full, or not there. Only my sister and me have seen them.

It's sort of disturbing to know that there are spirits that stay in my room. Are my sister and I the only ones who can see her? I need help. No one believes me, and my sister is too scared to tell any one. She's scared of what her friends will say. Please help. I saw her last night. She was saying something. I don't know what. She wasn't making any sound, but her lips were moving. I'm scared, I'm only 14. I shouldn't be seeing dead people. Are they dead? Am I too young? I know I sound pathetic asking a lot of questions, but I'm curious. Was I picked for a reason?

The Girl in the White Dress,Ireland,Children Who See Spirits,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Children Who See Spirits :: The Girl in the White Dress

W hen I was young, my aunt (who first introduced me to the world of the paranormal), always said to me that I had a gift. While my mother was pregnant with me, my father had built our house that we now live in. Previously, there had been an old house that had been knocked down to make way for a safer new house. My parents had been living there a couple of months before I was born. All was well until they brought me home from the hospital, when strange things started happening.

My mother told me the telly would switch on and off by itself. At night time they would hear babies crying, they would check me but I would be sound asleep. This went on for a few years when one day I was talking to my mother, when I mentioned my new friend that I was playing with, my mother took no notice and assumed that I had an imaginary friend, she told me she would hear me talking and come down and there would be nobody around. This also went on for quite sometime.

We had an old friend of the family (who we will call mary for the sake of the story) around for tea one day. I was playing when I said something that made mary shudder and to this day she says it still puts a chill down her spine. I mentioned my friends name, sarah, mary turned around and asked me who sarah was and I said the girl in the white dress with the long blonde hair. I carried on playing while mary explained. In the old house a family had lived. There was a little girl who had tragically died just before her first holy communion. She was laid out, where our sitting room would be now in her white dress with her long blonde hair down and her name was sarah. My mother was distressed by this and took me to a local man who is a faith healer and she asked him to stop whatever was happening to me until I was old enough to understand, which honestly I don't think I ever will.

My parents had a mass said in the house to help the spirits to move on. After the mass my mother and her sister went to the bathroom (as they were too afraid to go by themselves) and when they opened the door, there was an old lady standing there waving and then she disappeared. God only knows who this old lady was but I hope she is in a better place.

This is the first of many stories, I hope to write and share all my experiences with you. I would love to hear any comments that anybody has to offer. Thank you for reading!

A Shadow in my TV,Australia,Apparitions / Voices / Touches,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Apparitions / Voices / Touches :: A Shadow in my TV

T his happened about 2 years ago when I was still in year seven, me and my little sister share a room together and this occurred on a saturday night I think, I'm not sure but I do remember the experience quite well, just not the pacific time or day.

I had just finished doing an assignment for school and then watched a bit of a movie, I had gone into our bedroom and turned off the TV, I didn't look at the TV once, though I had left the light on because my little sister was afraid of the dark. I had slipped into my bed and I went to sleep, I woke up in the middle of the night and my eyes were a bit blurred, I turned over and looked around (like I normally do), I saw this black tall figure in the TV standing over my sister's bed, it was hard to tell but it was either my bed or hers because of the TV, I freaked and my eyesight went normal and it was still there! I quickly rushed up and turned on the TV and I felt a bit more relaxed but felt a presence, I didn't get much sleep that night.

It happened again later that week, I had just finished having a shower and I walked into my room, and well I felt that unpleasant presence again, like how you're being watched, I looked up at the TV, and then that figure was right there behind me, I freaked and turned around, nothing was there and I turned to look at the TV, the figure wasn't there anymore. I didn't start believing in ghosts until then, that figure hasn't shown up since that week because I always wear my buddha my mother gave to me, I feel safe with it on, but when I'm home alone I still feel like something is watching me...

I had another experience last week, it freaked me out, I went to put my cat outside and then I looked over at the fence and there was this figure of a head looking at me and it was kind of a blurry white I ran back inside, I'm sure it wasn't my neighbour they were all inside their house.

Do you think I was just being delusional? I have no idea who or what that figure is but I know it was real. Do any of you know what it might be at all? I'm guessing it's just another ghost but it was black figure and a figure can be anything.

A Haunted Papermill,"Washington, United States",Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: A Haunted Papermill

A few months ago, I took a job as a security guard at Longview Fibre in Longview, WA. The job sucked. It was the most boring thing I've ever done. I worked the graveyard shift (12am-8am). My job consisted of walking half the property of the paper mill 5 times each night. It was about 16 miles of walking per day. During my rounds, I had to enter each building, walk through it, and exit on the other side of it. After doing this for a week or so, I began to notice some unexplainable things...

The first thing I noticed was in the garage. The garage was a building where forklifts and heavy equipment were maintained. It was built in two sections. There was an old section that was built many years ago, and a newer one that was built probably within the last 20 or so years. These two sections were not separated by doors or anything like that. The new section was basically just an addition to the old building. There was a large passageway that connected the two parts. During my rounds, I wasn't required to go in the newer section, but after a few nights, I figured I'd look around. As soon as I entered the newer section of the building, a loud banging started. I just kind of shrugged it off as creaking pipes or something and went on with my shift.

The second time I noticed something weird, I was in the garage again. When I went in the garage, I was supposed to enter at one door, walk across the old section, and exit on the other end. Near the exit door was a counter. On top of the counter was a large cardboard box full of empty pop cans. Someone must have been recycling. Well, one night, as I was walking toward the exit door, about 15 feet from it, that cardboard box scooted off the counter and onto the floor. The pop cans went everywhere. I wasn't looking at the box as it fell, but rather, the ground ahead of me. I was bored and just staring at the floor as I walked. Now, I wasn't looking straight at the box, but it was right in front of me. I'd swear that after the box fell, I saw a shadow zip away from it to the left. I thought it must have been a pop can that rolled away really fast, but looked and there was nothing that went that way. Then I shrugged it off thinking it must have been a mouse or something.

The third time I noticed something weird, I was once again in the garage. Let me explain the layout a little further. When you walk in the entry door, there is a flight of stairs right in front of you. At the top of the stairs is a store room. The door to the room is always supposed to be locked. Well one night I walked into the garage and saw the door to the store room wide open. I went up the stairs to check the room to make sure no one was in there. Immediately as I walked in the room I felt someone breathing on the back of my neck. I also had an overwhelming feeling that someone was watching me. Of course, that could have had something to do with the breath on the back of my neck! Needless to say I got the hell out of there quick!

After having quite a few experiences, I brought it up to my co-workers. Turns out, everyone of them (except for ONE) had had numerous experiences. In fact, there were several that would refuse to enter certain buildings after dark. We exchanged stories and found that we had all had experiences in the same places. One guy, said that he saw the same store room door open that I did, and as he was watching, he saw someone walk across the door way. But he went up and checked the room and no one was there. Another lady had seen a figure in some steam outside the garage. I'm not really one to be scared by this stuff, so I got pretty curious.

The next time I was in the garage, I made sure to go visit the new section wondering what I could find out about the loud banging in there. I started by standing on the edge of the new section and the old section. I was just on the side of the old section. I stood there for a few minutes and listened very quietly. It was completely quiet. You could have heard a pin drop. Then I took one step into the new section. I stood there for a few seconds and the loud banging started. That particular day, it sounded like someone was hitting the metal siding with a big chain. So then I stepped back into the old section and the banging stopped. I did this procedure a couple times. After I was confident that it was only banging when I was in the new section, I figured I'd try to figure out where it was coming from. I was unsuccessful. The banging would move as you move through building. It would always seem like it's coming from the wall near you, but when you go there, it's coming from somewhere else. Just a little creepy huh?

A week or so later, I used my cell phone to take some video of the banging. Obviously all there is to see is the inside of the garage, but you can hear the banging. But there's something weird about it. There's TONS of static! It almost drowns out the really loud banging (however you can still hear it). I've heard that if you slow down the sound, the static becomes and audible message or something like that. At the moment I can't transfer the video onto my computer (need a cable) but when I can, I'll post it here.

I've had several more experiences at this location, including a light show, but I'm getting tired of typing now. Maybe I can add to it later. I'll post the video when I can.

The Obon Visitor,"Arizona, United States",Family / Friends Visits,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Family / Friends Visits :: The Obon Visitor

M y grandmother has been dead for about a year and she was born and raised in Japan. During the time before the Obon, legend says that your ancestors are around you and they return at the end of the dancing festivities. I never believed in all of that but during last years Obon, my grandmother was being honored and I was attending.

I was helping take care of my aunt who didn't speak any english and was bedridden. My 3 year old son came in the room one day and he said to me, ""Mommy, there is a lady in the bedroom..."" He was talking about my grandmother's old room. I was caught off guard and I began to ask him questions to describe her, I asked if she was nice or mean. He said she was nice, then I asked if she looked like me or like my elderly aunt. And he said she looked like my aunt, and promptly left the room. I got up and walked toward the other bedroom and I heard my son talking to an older woman.

The room was dark but I saw him sitting on the bed swinging his legs as he talked. I heard both voices, and it was my grandmother's voice. I couldn't hear what they were talking about because my aunt called me, but when I got back in the room with her, she stopped me from scooping up more food. She held my hand, told me that my grandmother would take great care of him and not to worry. She always had a connection with my grandmother and there were times that I heard her talking to what seemed like herself. It lasted for about 30 minutes and I would hear my son and the woman laughing and playing, I didn't know how I could explain it but I knew that it made my son feel safe so I accepted it.

My son seemed to be the only one that could see her, but during the trip a blanket appeared when I woke up in the morning that I hadn't put there. Also she protected him when my father and I had a big fight and he didn't hear all of the yelling and slept like an angel through it. I like to think that she was there to protect my Aunt but she was able to get to play with my son as a bonus. Ever since then I have wanted to know all that I can about her, and it warms my heart to know that she was there.

I Need the Unexplainable Explained,Canada,Misc,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Misc :: I Need the Unexplainable Explained

D o you know the feeling you get when you feel someone is right behind you or when you know that you are alone in a room and then you hear something or something grabs your shoulder? I experience this on a daily basis.

It happens during the afternoon, night, but not the morning. Late at night I can feel a 'thing' in the room with me, and then I hear voices and things moving around. When I look to see what is happening there is nothing going on. My mother believes that I am just asleep when I 'hear' these things and that I just don't realize it. I am not a religious person, and I do believe in ghosts. But I don't go to church... I am 16 and I don't know what to do. This thing is angry I can tell by the change in air. I have seen ghosts many times, but they were calm and this apparition won't leave me alone.

If anyone can help me with this it would be much appreciated, seeing as how I have not slept for 19-30 days straight. I get naps but that's about it...

Has anyone had this happen? If so, please comment on this story and tell me what to do. Many comments would be appreciated I would also like a thorough description on what to do. I haven't slept and am a little dull at times. Thank your.

At the End of the Road,"Washington, United States",Family / Friends Visits,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Family / Friends Visits :: At the End of the Road

I am not really sure whether or not to consider this a ghost story or not, you can read and let me know. I am 17, I am young and I was younger then. My cousin killed himself at the end of my road (I live at a dead end) when he was 17 and I was 13. He was one of my best friends but I guess you could say this world got the better of him.

Not too long after his death, about 2 months or so I would say, I was listening to music in my cd player and reading a book. I was just laying there and my cd player has a knob on it, the kind you have to turn, and well, it turned down! At first I thought, ""oh well just bumped it"", but then it happened a few more times. I was thinking ""okay that's a little creepy"" but brushed it off as nothing.

I got up later and then came back and it happened again, finally after about 2 more times, (I didn't see it happen but I could hear it and then I would turn it back up) I just said ""okay matt this isn't funny would you knock it off?"" and it stopped. So that was that.

Later I did end up dreaming about him but I don't think it was related, it was just of him walking through my house and I passed him in the hall, and I stopped and was like, ""aren't you dead?"" He said ""no"", and went into the bathroom and I followed (strangely my cd player was in there) and he said ""you might want to go outside"". I went outside and looked, and everywhere I looked there were people being hung, but not from trees or anything, from those things that they used to hang more than 1 person. I looked at the end of the road and there was my family going up on it, but luckily for me I woke up before I saw it.

The weird thing about that though is my mom was up there with my dad and brother and sisters, and she died 4 years before this dream. I love my family so you can see how the dream would scare me. Nothing bad has happened since then, well death wise, so I'm pretty sure I think it was just a dream.

The Man in Plaid,"Washington, United States",Apparitions / Voices / Touches,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Apparitions / Voices / Touches :: The Man in Plaid

I have had a few experiences in my life that seem as though they could do with the paranormal. I also in my life have experienced a few close deaths. The story I am about to write right now seems to me like it could be something to do with it. Earlier this year, a few times actually, I was laying in my room in the dark and I would look at my door and see a man in plaid. I thought nothing of it, I just thought my eyes playing tricks right? Well maybe...

It happens in the morning, my door is always loose, it creaks open in the middle of the night, so when I wake up in the morning it's open. But that's just my door. A few times I looked out and there was a man in red plaid. I didn't know what to do, it terrified me but I didn't feel threatened. You couldn't really see the rest of him and of course he was nearly completely transparent but you couldn't notice his plaid shirt and his face was some what visible. Now I was freaked out. I had told my boyfriend of this, and he just was like ooo creepy. No help.

I was talking to someone later, not necessarily about this and they told me that my grandpa had died not too long ago. He was a logger who had gotten paralyzed years ago and had left my grandma, so I thought that was a weird coincidence, it didn't happen more that twice, but there was this time when my boyfriend was standing by my door, (my room is tiny so he didn't need to come close just to ask me a question, which is what he was doing, about what I don't remember) and this hand came through the door by his head, I freaked out and he just asked me what I was freaking out about and I told him, he was a little freaked out but you would be too more than likely.

On to Something,"New York, United States",Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: On to Something

I have always had a connection in my family with the paranormal. My grandmother was sensitive and my family lived in a haunted house for several years in the '90s. Recently, I had an overt encounter with an unexplainable human-like force. Since then, I have felt more aware and tuned-in to a supernatural undercurrent. I believe now that the more alert you are, the more you may see or feel. For example...

I live in an apartment in Brooklyn, New York. I moved in to this place in the spring of 2002. I lived on the 1st floor and would experience strange things. Often, I would be sitting on the couch there when I would feel something lightly tap the top of my skull. Once, I felt a brush of cool air immediately before being tapped. I told me roommates about it, but they are both scientists and refused to believe me. After these run-ins with skepticism, I kept things to myself. However, on a few occasions, they shared encounters with me.

Often, when I'd be getting ready for bed, I would turn off the TV and then the stereo and walk across the room to the stairs to go up to bed. The second that my foot would touch the first stair, the TV and/or stereo would go back on--sometimes together, sometimes only one of the two. I would then walk back across the room and turn them off. One time I did this and had to go back twice to turn off the TV. Each time, the appliances would turn themselves on as soon as my foot touched the first stair, as if I was being toyed with. One of my roommates saw this happen once and, while he found it difficult to explain, would still not believe our house was haunted. I, too, was not entirely convinced thinking I could chalk up these experiences to nerves and electrical malfunctions.

One night while sleeping in this apartment, I had a disturbing dream. I dreamt that there was a door within my room to a ""new room"" that isn't really there. There was incredible light blasting through the cracks around the door and frame. In this dream, an overpowering force was pulling me up out of my bed towards the door. This was not a good feeling, in fact, it was terrifying for some reason. When I awoke from this dream, I was sitting halfway up in bed as if I really was being pulled by my chest out of the bed. It was like I was awoken in the middle of a sit-up. To know what I mean, try laying flat on the floor and then sit up without employing any muscles or limbs except for your abdominal muscles. You will see that this is quite difficult unless you're in excellent shape. So anyway, I awoke and immediately fell back down into the bed as if I was a marionette and my strings had been suddenly severed. I found my pillows laying underneath the windowsill across the room. I felt as though the house itself was trying to communicate with me or something, that a dialogue had opened between myself and something unseen.

I moved out of this apartment in 2005 to live in Manhattan for a few years. This past October, after my incident with a ghost in Europe, I moved back into the same apartment building serendipitously, but into the fourth floor unit instead of the first. My old roommates still live in the first floor apartment, which is cool because it's easy for us to hang out after work--just like college! Anyway, one night when I was up in my place alone, I felt something tap me on top of my head. Immediately, I remembered how I was often tapped in this building the first time I lived there. I tried to brush it off and occupy my thoughts with something else.

Later that week, while standing in about the same place preparing the sheets for my bed for the night, I felt a light tap on top of my head again. Again, I tried to brush it off. After about ten seconds, as I was draping a blanket across my mattress, I felt an undeniably harder, more resolute tap on top of my head again. This time, I froze in mid-movement with my arms outstretched as I was tossing the blanket to the far side of my bed. I was petrified like that for about two whole minutes when I finally worked-up the courage to say, ""Please don't do that again, it really, really scares me. Thanks..."" I heeded advice I gleaned directly from this site and was polite, yet direct. I have not been tapped since then.

However, the most scary thing happened one Sunday afternoon while I was getting ready to shower and go watch some football. I was sitting on the futon upstairs alone working on the computer which was sitting next to me on the futon. I got up to go to the bathroom to prepare the shower. I turned on the water, but forgot my slippers in my room. I left the bathroom and walked back through the living room towards my bedroom. Before I got there, however, I noticed that a chair that had been in the kitchen fifteen seconds before, was now pressed up flush against the futon so that I could not sit down again where I had been sitting working on the computer. I had been in the bathroom for only a minute when this happened. I was pretty scared, but pushed it out of mind and went back to getting ready to leave. This in itself was not too alarming until I spoke with the tenant who lives directly below me on the third floor.

He came up to my apartment one night at about midnight asking if I had been banging on his door. My friends and I were hanging out and told him that we hadn't banged on his door, but that maybe he heard us stomping around. There are only 3 units in this four-floor building and all were accounted for at that time. He insisted that he most definitely heard someone banging loudly right on his front door for five or six bangs. Bewildered he went back downstairs. Later, I asked him about it again. Fearing rejection, I breached the subject carefully, ""Um, do you think per chance this building might be haunted?"" I was sure he'd laugh, but he just looked at me and said, ""Probably..."" He said his cat acts really strange sometimes and seems to follow invisible things about the room. I related the story about the chair to him and he grew pale. His girlfriend used to live in my current apartment (I know, small world, such is the micro-culture of Brooklyn youth) and he said she always pulled a chair up flush against their couch (which was positioned in the same place as my futon is now) to use as a makeshift desk on which to place her laptop. We both arrived at the same conclusion: this ghost might have thought it was helping me out by providing a platform for my computer. We have both been very aware and are looking out for things like this since then, but have experienced no repeat performances.

Some nights when I'm upstairs alone I love my apartment; sometimes, I feel very nervous and uncomfortable and I know I'm not alone. I love that place because it's so big and airy and clean, but on some nights, it has an undeniably sinister feel to it. I am ready and waiting.

Girls Bathroom,"New York, United States",Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: Girls Bathroom

O ne day, me and all my friends went to my friends house. And we were all in the bathroom getting ready for the prom, and as soon as everybody left, except me, I started hearing weird noises. My friend had told me her house was haunted, but I never believed that because I thought ghosts weren't real. The weird noise was like a creaking, in their bathroom closet. I thought it was just like an old house, so I ignored it. But the sound got bigger, and louder.

Then I heard tapping noises, so as soon as I opened the door, everything was still and silent. This happened like 6 more times. And like always I would open the door and nothing had happened. Except the last time I did... EVERYTHING CAME PILING OUT! Soon as we got back to school the next day, we all went into the girls bathroom. (of course rumors have it, that its haunted, but that's another story...) All my friends left at the bell... Except one, and me. As I came out to wash my hands, she ran out in tears, freaked out! I tried to stop her, but she way too fast for me. All of the sinks started turning on, one by one. Then all the blowers were on. As soon as I knew it, the toilets were flushing uncontrollably... Then the lights started to flicker. I was soo freaked out that I ran out and tried to find the friend who ran out in tears.

As soon as I found her, I asked why she left. She said she saw some one staring at her though the last stall window. (she said that he was a type of convict sort of guy, by the clothes he was wearing... But I knew it wasn't.) I told her what I have just encountered and she was amazed! And said that the exact same thing had happened to her one time, a loooong time ago that was.

Ever since that horrible accident, I have never gone in the downstairs bathroom again. (alone that is)

Events at Potomac Ridge Behavior Center,"Maryland, United States",Misc,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Misc :: Events at Potomac Ridge Behavior Center

I just came back from a behavior center for destroying property. I stayed there for fifteen days and returned to my computer an hour ago, and I met someone there who actually sees many spirits. Her name is Cassandra. She said that there is a lady that appears to her and she seems to be good.

Once, she was looking at the corner. I asked her if the lady was over there and she said yes. I didn't see anything at the corner. I asked her if I should say hi and Cassandra just shrugged. I waved my hand. A few nights after that, she was attacked by a man ghost and said that it looked liked the guy who raped her when she was six. I think she was also attacked other times. I saw a bandage on her forehead. I believe Cassandra because there is proof and I know that she is a nice girl. I really need your help.

My former roommate, Zack, has a Rudolph the red nosed reindeer buildabear. His nose could light up. We decided to go in the bathroom with the lights out and light up rudolph's nose. We did it and Zack said that we should go ghost hunting. A few seconds later, he said ""Oh shiat I see one"" and we evacuated the bathroom. Zack had the door open and said he could see his dad (who is already dead). He said hi and then I looked in and saw a dark shadow.

My roommate before Zack was Quentin. One morning, he said Bloody Mary in the dark mirror three times and came without screaming and claimed that he saw Bloody Mary. That night, Cassandra and Tricey came out of there room and told the staff that their toilet flushed by itself. I later found that the toilet flushed three times and the light beside flashed three times.

The House on Buckingham Street,"Michigan, United States",A Haunted Life,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: A Haunted Life :: The House on Buckingham Street

W hen I was five, my parents bought an abandoned house in Lincoln Park. It didn't have the typical characteristics of abandoned houses found in movies and such - the grass was overgrown due to neglect and the shingles had a little more wear and tear than one would like, but otherwise it had a decent interior, a semi-finished (though ugly) basement, and while the rooms were not painted in our colors of choice (my mom found them to be repulsive- deep red, navy blue, and dark green), it wasn't too bad for a first house.

Two weeks of painting and moving and finally we were set. I was given the smallest room in the house, but I was going to be gone for a few weeks that summer on a road trip out west, so my parents decided to paint my room pink. My dad was always good at drawing, and so he painted a portrait of our family dog, Mickey, on my wall, and above the light switch painted ""Britt's Room"". He also drew sketches of Mickey Mouse and made little red hearts. It was cute.

Unlike most of the stories posted here, I did not visibly see a ghost or shadow or watch objects move by themselves. In fact, nothing that unusual happened for awhile. But that summer a lot of mail came in for children that supposedly lived there still. My mom would give them to me instead of throwing them away. One of these was a book of fun stamps that someone had actually paid for a subscription to. I thought it was odd that the parents (or whoever) didn't cancel the subscription before leaving, but then again, the whole idea of abandoning the house seemed odd as well. They didn't even bother selling it for money. My dad told us once, ""Well, the realtor said they just couldn't live here anymore and decided to leave. I don't really know why...""

As a little girl, I had what my parents called a ""wild imagination"". I was the kid who believed her dolls had parties behind closed doors, that the Beast from Beauty and the Beast was real and was going to eat her at night, that the photograph taken of her sitting on Santa's lap was actually a magical photograph and Santa used it to see what she was up to at all times (I actually placed it face down on my dresser when I was up to no good in order to avoid getting a spot on his naughty list), and even if I'm barely this way now, I had a lot of spooks growing up that were caused by none other than me.

But then there were the three years spent in this house on Buckingham- the Buckingham Palace, we called it, that couldn't be explained by just an over-active imagination.

Like most little girls, I had a cute little wooden vanity where I dumped all of my fake make-up and hair stuff and the works. On this particular day, I decided I was going to be Snow White, and so I hunted down an old halloween costume and began to make myself pretty. After about ten minutes, I heard someone call out my name- ""Brittany...""

And I hadn't just heard ""Brittany"" once. I heard ""Brittany"" several times, each time getting louder than the last, until eventually it was ""BRITTANY!"".

The odd thing was, this happened often. I kept hearing someone call my name but I could never find out who it was. My parents always told me it was a neighbor or I was just hearing things, but on this day I ran out of my room, completely forgetting my plans to be a Disney princess. I didn't return for awhile. I camped out on my mom's bedroom floor.

As the years passed, things became a little more strange. My mom worked at a grocer nearby, but her shifts were awful. I typically wouldn't see her until roughly midnight, sometimes even one in the morning. Because I so young, if I felt lonely or restless, I would stay up until she came in to say good night. But other times I would crash the moment my dad tucked me in and would almost sleep through her visit. One night, however, I was just too tired to wait up and I slept like a baby- until waking with a start. I didn't even get a chance to look around for the cause- directly in front of my face were the eyes and nose of what I assumed to be my mom, but this wasn't really a face. It was like a blown up image of her features, so big that it covered the entire width of my bed, and though I couldn't really see the mouth, she seemed to be smiling.

I stared at this image for a little while. I wasn't sleepy anymore, but I wasn't sure what to think. Was it my mom? I knew it wasn't physically her, but I was reassured (for whatever reason) that I shouldn't be scared and I shut my eyes. I opened them once more and the image was still there- but I fell fast asleep. When my mom woke me up later on that night, I told her what I saw, but she said, ""You must have been imagining things again...""

About a year before we moved out, I began to hear my name being called out more frequently- always by a female voice. I eventually gave up on telling my parents about it as they never really had anything helpful to say. I tried believing that they were right and it really was my imagination, but I just couldn't shake the feeling that someone was in the room with me. I always looked behind me when walking out of my room to find nothing but furniture and toys and pink walls. While outside, I would hear my name and turn around just to find Mickey circling the grass or dead leaves or something of the like. My parents never noticed anything unusual though, and so I carried on with daily life.

The last major event that took place happened shortly after I switched rooms with my mom. I decided (one day) that pink was a sissy color and blue was more my style and my mom had a light blue room. Since we were moving out shortly, she agreed and most of the incidents stopped. I still heard my name every now and then but it was becoming more and more rare, and I definitely stopped seeing faces in the middle of the night. But one odd thing came in a dream.

I'm sure that at least some of you remember the veterinarian Barbie- the one that came with the little plastic dog and cat and a little white case with medical tools inside. I had a big cardboard box stashed in my closet where I would put all of my Barbie things, and one night, after securing all of my toys in this box, I had a dream that, in essence, my little plastic cat became possessed, and out of a jealous rage that I played with the dog more, ran away. The last scene in my dream was of it turning its head towards me and showing me red beady eyes before walking out of my room robot style. I woke up a little freaked (I mean, red eyes? Come on.) but thought nothing of it- until I looked in my box and the cat was gone.

Even after packing and cleaning and searching through everything, I had never been able to find my cat. I don't honestly believe that the thing ran away, either, but it is a little strange. It hadn't been thrown away, given away, or stolen by any of my friends. I didn't really have friends at that time, so no one really ever came over, and I had played with that very cat just a couple days before it went missing. I was pretty bummed. We moved to a nice little house a couple cities over (more stories to come if you are interested), and I couldn't shake this strange feeling that I was forgetting something important. I even had dreams about it. But passing it off as nothing, I moved on with my life.

My senior year of high school came around, and while in the car with my dad, I decided to tell him about all the crazy stuff I went through as a child and all the stunts I pulled. After a bit of laughing and a ""tease Brittany because she kept hearing her name all the time and saw faces"" session, my dad's facial expression suddenly became serious, and he said, ""Remember your old bedroom?""

""Well, don't get me wrong. I don't think our house was haunted or anything. But I know why the house was abandoned. The realtor told me that the former owner had committed suicide in one of the rooms- your old room before you switched with your mom. The one I spent countless hours painting so that you could decide later you didn't want it anymore. Anyway, yeah. I didn't really want to tell you or your mom because I didn't want to scare you guys, but now you know. I'm sorry...""

My Sister Rides With Me,"Connecticut, United States",Family / Friends Visits,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Family / Friends Visits :: My Sister Rides With Me

I consider myself to have had many psychic experiences throughout my life, but this one was by far the most amazing thing that has ever happened to me. I awoke one morning to loud music and I had no idea where it was coming from. I went into the living room of my apartment and looked through a box of my deceased sister's things. I pulled out one of her stuffed animals, but I didn't even know it played music. I had picked that stuffed animal up a million times and had even moved it with me into my new apartment and never knew it played music. I shut the music off and went back to bed. Later that day I was getting ready for night class and I noticed four of my sister's pictures were placed facing down. Not sure what to make of it, I left it alone and went to class.

Later that night I was driving home from graduate school after class and I was about to pass an old church at the top of this large hill. As I approached the church that was directly to my left, a car passed me in the opposite direction, shining his lights into my car. The car's lights seemed to cascade into my car in slow motion, and I felt as if it was rippling into my car like water. My gaze was immediately taken to my rear view mirror, and there was my sister staring blankly through me as the light cascaded across her face. She looked like an angel. I almost couldn't breathe and I was so scared I felt like I was hit by lightening. The vision only lasted for a fraction of a second, but it felt like a whole minute to me. My sister died in a car accident two years ago and of course I thought I'd never see her again. But that night, I did.

Foul Smelling Demon,"Texas, United States",Demons / Possessions / Exorcisms,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Demons / Possessions / Exorcisms :: Foul Smelling Demon

S hortly after my second divorce, I went through a period of anger and depression. I found myself constantly questioning God, why my life was not going well. One Saturday morning it was about 2:00a.m. I was laying on the living room floor watching the television, I felt so restless and could not go to sleep. As I was laying there I saw out of the corner of my eye a shadow pass from the kitchen and go into my bedroom, thinking it was just my imagination I did not give it a second thought.

A little later I could hear in a raspy tone something going pssst, pssst, I turned around still laying on the floor and felt something heavy jump on my chest. I could not move and was totally in the worst fear of my life. I closed my eyes and felt whatever this thing was, breathing inches away from my face, and it was the foulest smell I have ever known, the smell was worse than that of rotting meat. In fear and in desperation I called upon God but could not get the words out, I was babbling and still unable to move and I definitely did not want to open my eyes for fear of what I may have seen. I felt its foul, hot breath inch closer to my face and in a menacing voice said, ""Open your eyes and see who commands you"". At that point I started to talk to God with my mind, and asked him to forgive me for questioning Him and for anything I may have done to offend Him, or anyone. I promised God that if He were to remove this presence away from me, I would never love anything or anyone in this world more than I loved Him. At that very moment I felt the weight lift off my chest and felt a peace like none before.

This all happened in the spring of 1985 in San Antonio, Texas. I did move shortly after that, and while I still have had other supernatural and paranormal experiences, this one was by far the worst and the scariest.

Angels to the Rescue,"Texas, United States",Misc,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Misc :: Angels to the Rescue

A bout 5 years ago my sister Cha Cha, called me and told me she had been involved in a car accident. Apparently she had lost control as the streets were wet and crashed unto a guardrail. Upon arriving at the scene she was okay but visibly upset and shook up. Her vehicle had damaged to the front of the car, the grill was bent up, the left front fender was dented and the hood was bent and would not close.

We had the vehicle towed to my other sisters' house (Alice), which was not far from the site of the accident. I told Cha Cha not to worry as I had a friend that owned a body repair shop and would contact him the next day for an estimate on repairs.

The next day I called Cha Cha, and told her my friend from the body shop could meet us at Alices' house and look at her car and he would give her a good price seeing how I was a good friend of his.

Cha Cha, told me that the night of the accident she was trying to figure out how she was going to pay for the repairs on the car as she had no insurance. She told me that at about three o'clock in the morning she felt something shaking her bed. She sat up on her bed and saw six people young and old standing in front of her bedroom doorway smiling and motioning to her to follow them. She said she got scared and tried to wake up her husband up but he would not wake up. She said she began to pray and covered herself head to toe with the blanket hoping they would go away. I told her not to worry, probably the stress of the car was getting to her and I would pick her up after I got off from work to go meet my friend and see about the car.

I picked Cha Cha up after work and on the way to Alices' house Cha Cha kept talking about what she had seen and could not get it off of her mind.

We arrived at Alices' house and lo and behold the car was sitting on the driveway, there were no dents, the grill was intact, the fender had no damage what so ever and the hood was tightly closed. We looked at each other and could not believe our eyes there was absolutely no damage to the car. Now there were several witnesses to the damage we saw before, my father, my sister Alice, Cha Cha, her two sons, and myself.

I called my friend from the body shop and told him we did not need an estimate after all, but did not tell him why, who would have believed me after all?

I told Cha Cha that maybe those smiling people she had seen earlier and wanting her to follow them were probably angels letting her know they had fixed her car. And apparently they did. Cha Cha got in the car, it started up without a hitch and safely made it home.

Our New Apartment,"New Hampshire, United States",Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: Our New Apartment

W e moved into our current apartment in November of 2004, right before Thanksgiving. Our old apartment was about a block and a half down the road, so instead of renting a moving truck my children and I would load up the car after work and bring things over. The first time we were doing this is when things started to happen in our ""new"" home. There is a mud room that has a locking door and it leads to the main door of the apartment. The mud room has a lock on the door handle and the main door also has a door lock and a dead bolt.

As we were leaving to get another load, my son asked if he should lock all the locks. I told him no we were coming right back with more and to just lock the handle on the main door. We left and returned about 45 minutes later and the mud room door was locked as well as the main door handle and the dead bolt! We all thought it was weird, but kept on moving things in.

A few months later my children and I were eating dinner in the dining room and my son was talking to me (the kitchen is located behind where I was sitting) and he got this really weird look on his face. Not scared but odd. His sisters' sneakers were sitting on the floor next to the island and they all of a sudden flipped on their sides.

For months my son would not go to bed unless we were home. He said every time he would walk up the stairs he would feel like someone was pushing him down the stairs and a couple of times he did fall backwards.

Things would disappear and then reappear months later for no apparent reason.

There was another time, my husband and I were sleeping and I woke up to the smell of cigarette smoke. I do not smoke any longer but my husband does. He smokes outside because my daughter has asthma. So I woke him up to ask if he had just smoked a cigarette and he said no. I then asked if he could smell the smoke and he said no. A few days later I was telling my friend and my husband admitted he did smell smoke but didn't want me to be up all night ""freaked"" out.

The incident that really sticks out happened on Christmas day 2006. I was washing dishes and my son was in his room, my husband was watching TV and my daughter was running up the stairs to her room. While she was running, the light on our bakers rack would go on and off for every step she hit. I thought I was seeing things, so I called her back down and told her to run up the stairs again (by the way she thought I was crazy, I'm always yelling at her not to run in the house). And it happened again! This time my husband saw it. So, she came back down and we were all standing there and I said well maybe Bob is mad no one said Merry Christmas to him. So my daughter yelled ""Merry Christmas Bob"" and ran up the stairs again and nothing.

There has been dozens and dozens of things that have happened in the apartment. At times I want to investigate the history of the building but, then something in me says I don't want to know (it's just a weird feeling I get).

Bumps in the Day,"Indiana, United States",Poltergeists / Physical Manifestations,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Poltergeists / Physical Manifestations :: Bumps in the Day

W hat would your reaction be if you know that there is no one in the rest of the house but you who is in the bathroom, and you hear people walking in the second floor and hear as if someone was looking for something since you hear rattling going on? Well, that is exactly what I hear in my house. I had not heard anything for a while, I have been burning sage and I say my prayers, read the bible out loud and so I was thinking that whatever was in my house is no longer there, in other words gone, right?

Wrong! I guess I can rest assured that whatever it is, it is not harmful since all this praying is going on and it does not face it. I believe it was Tuesday 1/2/08 I was getting ready for work, my husband and son had already left and my daughter and I were the only ones left in the house. My daughter was on my bed watching her cartoons and I was putting on my makeup. All of a sudden I hear a small thump! I thought it was my dog in the kitchen, I had just out him in the kennel since he is still a puppy, while we are gone we put him in there so that he does not tear the house apartment. He tends to make so much noise to get comfy I guess (who would be comfy in a cage) but, we must do it at least until he gets older.

I know that sounds a bit harsh but I love animals and God knows I take good care of him, but anyway back to my story, so I hear the thump and as I stand still to figure out where it came from I hear it again and I realize that it is coming right above my head which is Emilie's room. I look to my right to make sure my daughter is still on the bed and she is. I just blew it off and kept putting my makeup on, then it gets worse, I hear someone going through the room as if looking for something, I walk out of the Bathroom and into the living room and look up the stairway to see if I could maybe see a shadow or something, meanwhile the rattling and thumping is still going on. To be honest with you I was so terrified to go up the stairs and see what was up there. I grabbed my daughter and left the house.

Later that day I told my husband what had happened and he did not say much, as usual trying to find a reason as to what I heard. We had dinner and as we were cleaning the kitchen, we heard a bang almost like a drum beat (thump, thump, thump) he heard it first, I noticed he stopped and looked at me and said ""what was that?"" I said what then there it goes again we said maybe the dog wagging his tail against something we look and he is laying there on the kitchen floor asleep, my son had a headache and had gone upstairs to sleep so we thought maybe he is jumping on the bed and the headboard is banging on the wall.

I go upstairs and he is asleep, sound asleep, I come back down and tell him and you could see the color draining from his face. He went out to check around the house and nothing, mind you the noise is still going while all this is happening. We were never able to find the culprit. I turned to my husband and said ""you see I'm not crazy!"" He just laughed and said ""I know you're not I have had my things happened to me as well"". I just about strangled him when he told me that. But, he said he did it to not worry me.

Well, this morning I heard another thump but, to be truthful I ignored it and I don't think I heard it again. So, what do you all think. Maybe a residual haunting? I did find out that the property was owned by a man who was in charge of the Central Indiana Hospital for the Insane or something like that and there were so many people that died that they would dig holes in and burry them, he had this property at the time of this.

So,it makes me wonder if maybe he used this property to burry those poor bodies and now the souls are loose. This info was provided to me by someone that has the same problems and lives in the same area and her neighbor has had them too.  If any of you can help me find info on this that would be great. The mans name was Henry W. Tutewiler, Camby, Indiana, the property is now Heartland crossing and he did have a funeral home and was an undertaker with his son, Tutewiler and son that is all I have so far.

Shadow Man,"Arizona, United States",Old Hags / Night Attacks / Sleep Paralysis,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Old Hags / Night Attacks / Sleep Paralysis :: Shadow Man

T his is something that happened to me a few years back. I was spending the night at my grandma's house and I was in the bedroom. My grandma was in the living room sleeping on the couch. I was asleep and then felt something grab me and try to pull me off the bed. When I opened my eyes I saw a Shadow man. That's what was trying to get me off the bed. And I was scared and yelled for my grandma and all the normal things... I don't know if it was a dream or what but it felt very real and I was half way off of the bed when I woke up. All I know is how it felt and it felt real.

I don't really stay over there at night anymore, but every time I stayed there I felt uneasy. Anybody have any ideas? Also when my brother stayed there he said he saw a wolf at the end of the hallway. And I have heard a walker... My great grandfather stayed at her house before he died... I felt like this shadow man wanted to hurt me. And I'm pretty sure my grandpa wouldn't have tried to hurt me. My mom and grandma both told me and my brothers that house was haunted but nothing ever tried to drag me out of bed or anything.

Edward and the Pets from Beyond the Grave,"Ohio, United States",Psychic / Medium,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Psychic / Medium :: Edward and the Pets from Beyond the Grave

I 'm a young girl who can see ghosts. As the title says, I can see a man, who's name I'm not EXACTLY sure of, but I'm getting a strong feeling that this man goes by the name of Edward. He paces the hallway, where all the family's bedrooms are. We live in a 3 bedroom ranch with a living room, kitchen, utility room, and 2 bathrooms.

Until about 5 years ago, when we added a second, larger, living room to the back of the house. It's not just Edward, I can also see dogs from beyond the grave. Mostly my deceased pets, but one that I've never seen before, probably one that my mom and dad had before they adopted me. I think Edward needs help, but I don't know how to help him. The only time I see him is when I'm alone in the hallway or in the middle of the night in the hallway. (I'm a little Insomniac) And so, If I talk to him I might wake everyone up. And when I'm home alone, I'm too scared to stay in the hallway alone. How can I help him? And how would he benefit from it? I need help.

As for the dogs, I just see little glimpses for a split second. They are usually just standing there looking at me. It's usually of my two deceased dogs, Dana and Jasmin. But last night I got a glimpse of a dog that I don't know. All my family's dogs have been boxers, and that's what the ""Unknown"" dog is, which is what makes me assume that it's my family's past dog. I just want to know what to do about all these ghosts.

Someone is Watching Over Me,Malta,Family / Friends Visits,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Family / Friends Visits :: Someone is Watching Over Me

A s a child I had always been interested by the supernatural but nothing really ever happened to me until I was about nine. My dad and I went to eat at TONY'S BAR, we were both eating breakfast and after we finished my dad started to smoke a cigarette, when he leaned forward to tap the cigarette ashes into the ashtray, it moved about fifteen centimeters away from him. We both looked at the ashtray amazed, not being able to believe what we had just seen. That was my first ever supernatural encounter.

My second was about four years later after my parents separation. I was staying at my dad's house, this was the place I grew up in which was over a hundred years old, it was about three in the morning and my dad had gone out to buy some fruit, I was so tired I decided to call it a night so I closed my eyes and fell half asleep. All of a sudden I felt a strong poke in my back and I know I was not dreaming, I turned around but no one was there, my dad hadn't arrived yet.

After that fright, although I was petrified, I was still extremely tired and I fell asleep some time after that. I was woken up again by the sound of the fan switching off by itself, it did it again a few times after that, I surely was not going to sleep after that.

Finally my dad arrived home and after I told him what had happened he mentioned to me that sometimes he would be lying in bed and then someone or something invisible would sit down next to him. After a bit, me and my dad figured out that it might be my deceased granddad looking out for us. Also one time it was about five in the evening, my auntie was arguing with my grandmum upstairs whilst I was in the bedroom downstairs, all of a sudden the door slammed so violently that the window opposite vibrated. Maybe it was just the wind but it was quite a normal non-windy day, it seemed more like an act of frustration.

All I know is that there is definitely someone in our house watching over us, especially when I walked down the staircase which has a creepy old bedroom directly behind it, I always feel as though I am being watched by someone.

Although my story may not be as spine chilling as some of the other ones I felt the need to share it with this site.

Me-Maw?,"Louisiana, United States",Family / Friends Visits,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Family / Friends Visits :: Me-Maw?

T his is my first time writing about my experiences. I have had many experiences not only in the house that I live in now but the previous house that I once lived in. Here are a few stories that I remember and tell to people who don't believe.

When I was 7 years old my grandmother who I called Me-Maw, of who I was EXTREMELY close to passed away from medical problems. She had been in and out of the hospital and nursing home. She passed away in the nursing home that we live behind. I was DEVASTATED. Well not to long after that is when I noticed weird things start to happen. I was terrified to be in the house along, or walk down the hall, or even be in my room by myself.

One day I was across my room from the door and I was sitting there on the floor, now you much know that my Me-Maw smoked these nasty smelling cigarettes, so I was just sitting there and my whole room was engulfed with the smell of these nasty cigarettes. I looked behind me and ran out of my room.

My mom is the kind you can tell anything to so I ran to her and told her and she was like yeah I smell it around me too at certain times. Well we talked about it for a few minutes and then I decided to go back to my room, and the smell was gone. I got very upset because I realized that it was probably my Me-Maw and I had scared her away.

Sometime later I don't remember exactly how long after that incident this one occurred. I awoke with a strange feeling, so I picked my head up and looked around and then I called for my mom. I always had to have her lay with me until I fell asleep or if I woke up. I laid back down to try to go back to sleep but it wouldn't work, so I again called for my mom. I did this a few more times and when I picked my head up the last time I looked at the door only to notice a lady standing there. She had no face, I couldn't tell what she was wearing and I couldn't see any feet. I was terrified! I just looked at her and she just stared straight at me.

Then as we were just examining each other she stuck her hand straight out to me and took a step! Just to say I wanted to jump out of my skin! It wasn't a scared feeling, it was an excitement, I felt at peace. I was scared don't get me wrong but it was a peaceful and calming feeling.

After we looked at each other for what felt like an eternity, which was only about a few seconds, I put my head back down and went right back to sleep. After every experience I've had, I was always able to fall right back asleep.

I believe that it was the same night at the last experience, but I remember having a dream of someone coming to my bed side and rubbing my back and playing with my hair until I fell asleep. I also remember feeling very peaceful and loved and safe.

I've had many other experiences in that house. We have since moved from that house, but that was my home for about 11-12 years. I moved into that house at the age of 2 and was there until the age of 14 years old.

My Mother's Voice,"Louisiana, United States",Apparitions / Voices / Touches,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Apparitions / Voices / Touches :: My Mother's Voice

T his story isn't that long but it's kind of creepy to me, because of what happens. Just read and tell me what you think about what happen! One night I was in my old house and I was in my room doing something, I was about 9 to 10 years old at the time, give or take a few years. I was busy when all of a sudden I heard my mother scream her roommates name and a faint whisper said mine. I rushed to the kitchen and asked the roomate if mom was home. I said ""I heard her scream your name."" The response I got back scared me to death, ""No. She isn't home yet, and I heard it too."" As I was being answered this weird, scared look came over both of our faces.

She then walked outside and looked in the drive way and my moms' car wasn't there. She then walked in the front yard all the way to the fence thinking it was our neighbor and realized that it wasn't her either. By this time I was freaked out a little and waited inside for her patiently and when she returned she grabbed the phone and called my mom, there was no answer. She then tried a few more times and no answer. We then received a phone call from my mom telling us where she was and what she was doing. She was out of town, she often had to go out of town for her job and she informed us that she was on her way home and that she was talking to a friend of hers that she hadn't seen in a long time.

I don't really understand why the voice sounded like my mom, she was in no danger that we knew of. But she told us that while she was standing there she got this over whelming feeling to get in touch with us, so she cut her conversation short and returned to her car to phone us and left the location that she was at. Maybe it was someone helping us in a way that we will never know, or maybe it was someone that we love just getting in touch with us and making us get in touch with one another. Whatever or whoever it was, was greatly appreciated. Any insight to what or who this might have been is great.

My New House,"Louisiana, United States",Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: My New House

W e moved into a new house the summer before my freshman year of high school, I am now a freshman in college. Friends of mine had moved into my old house and before they moved out we were told that a few weird things had happened to them in that house also. Nothing scary just weird, things that they can't explain.

I believe that in my new house we have a cowboy like man who walks from the side door of my house around the corner and down the hall to my bedroom door and just stands there. On many different occasions we have seen him, if you sit on the couch every now and then you can catch a glimpse of him walking by. He isn't scary, just a shadow. He has never done anything to anyone and I don't believe that he is there all the time. Sometimes you can see his shadow and other times you can't. I wonder if he is there because of something that has happen to him in the past.

I also believe we have a young lady who has long beautiful wavy hair, she's tall, and very thin. I've only encountered her on two occasions, once when I was entering the house. I had many packages in my hand and I was turning off the alarm system and I looked up and she was just standing there in the dining room. Once family stopped by to visit and we they were standing outside, I wasn't there, saying their goodbyes and my Porge ran back inside to use the restroom, they had a long journey home in front of them. When she came outside she went up to my mom and asked her if she has ever had an experience inside the house and my mom's response was ""No, but Enjolee has had many. She then continues to tell my mom that we have ghosts in our house, she either felt the ladies presence of saw her. I'm not to sure. After that night my mom became a true believer.

I also believe we have a spirit who likes to inject fear into us. I feel as if I'm always being watched. I consistently look over my shoulder. I feel like I can never get any peace. I hate being home alone and I'm 18 years old. I use to love being home alone, but I will not do it anymore.

There have been many instances that occur in my room. I have turned off my closet light and I get in bed all nice and comfy and turn off the lamp next to my bed and I do so, then look up and my closet light is on again. So I repeat the same steps until the light stays off.

There has been many times when someone or something has played with my hair at night, which puts me to sleep, odd I know but it works. There was this one time where I was in my room on the computer with my back to my HUGE window and all of a sudden I hear a loud BOOM and my whole room shacks. My window is about 7 feet off the ground. There is NO way that any person could have hit my window with that much force and moved anything they used before I ran outside to see. That was the first thing I did. I ran out of my room and ran outside to see what could have done that. There was nothing, just like I figured but I was terrified! I tried to explain everything to my mom but she couldn't understand.

The most terrifying incident that has ever happen to me was when the cross over my door in my bedroom went missing. It was taken off the wall and we couldn't account for it. Then the next day it was back on the wall again, just like it had never went missing. I am a freak about those things. They're has to be a cross above my door. It makes me feel safe, it also has to be blessed by a priest and have holy water on it.

One more thing. There is this unexplainable knocking noise. We hear it only in the living room and it sounds like it's either coming from the front porch or the attic. We had a swing on the front porch but it has been moved because of this noise because we thought that was what it was, but it isn't. After we removed the swing we still heard it, so we had people check the attic. Again, the answer was disturbing, there is NOTHING up there that can make the knocking noise. We have had this problem checked over and over again. Also we have a few leaks in the ceilings one over the toilet in the bathroom that just popped up one day and one over the fire place. We have also had these checked and there is nothing to indicate where it's coming from or why the leaking is happening. I'm not sure if our leaking problem is because of something supernatural but it's starting to make me wonder.

Everything that goes on in my house is something that I have learned to cope with. I have also learned to take it day by day and not to under estimate the power of the supernatural. Friends of mine are scared to be left in the house alone or to be in certain rooms alone. Only one friend of mine can account for most of the things that have happened. She has witnessed some of the doings herself.

I'm sorry this is so long. I hope you enjoyed. Please let me know if you have anything that you can offer. Thank you so much!

Haunted Auditorium,"Virginia, United States",Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: Haunted Auditorium

T o start off I go to this high school. I'm not going to release its name because the reputation of the school is bad enough and it doesn't need a ghost story. Back in ninth grade I started as a techie (technical theatre) so I would be up in the light booth working on lights and sound. One day I'm sitting there preparing for a show (getting cues set) and I heard someone whisper my name. The voice was female so I thought it was my theatre director. I looked out of the little window we have there and there was no one around so I dismissed it as my mind playing tricks.

Then I started hearing footsteps and the hairs on the back of my neck started standing up so I looked around and there was no one there. I walked into all three rooms of the booth and nothing. The little events happened every now and then so I just dismissed them and would continue working.

I started calling the ""ghost"" Sarah, the reason being the voice was female. (for some reason I'm starting to call her Carrie). Well there was the new kid who came in and started techie work too. It made me glad because I wasn't the only one now. Let's call him Steve (not his real name). He goes in the light booth sometimes during first period to sleep or hang out and work since he doesn't really do anything during that time. Now I never told Steve about all of my incidents.

One day we were staying after working and he asked if the auditorium was haunted. Now since I never told him about anything this kind of shocked me so I asked ""why?"". His response left me shocked. He said that he heard a female voice calling his name and footsteps but no one was in the except for him. Now you're probably asking ""well how does she know your names?"". I have no clue she must have heard of say them a lot.

I told him of my incidents as well. We still called her Sarah at this point so when something would happen we would joke and blame her. For this New Year (2008) a church hired me to come and work lights for a religious hearing at the school until about 1 a.m. I agreed. Now I'm not religious, but the church pays pretty good. I was the only one in the booth reading my book. Someone would occasionally come in and check the camera. As I'm reading I see a dark shadow move out of the corner of my eye. It was so fast I thought nothing of it until I saw it again. This time it was bigger and a little slower. I thought it was someone checking the camera but then I thought ""well I didn't hear the door open and the other door is locked..."" That kind of freaked me out for a moment but I just said ""Hey Carrie (yes I started calling her Carrie at this point...I'm still not sure why) don't scare me like that we can talk again some other time.""

I was in algebra class and I had just watched a show about mediums the night before and I figured hey let's try it. So I closed my eyes and thought ""hey if there's anyone here let me know"" over and over again. Then I felt my left side get really cold and the girl next to me noticed it too. Later that day I was in the light booth and I decided to have some fun. I closed my eyes and said ""If there's anyone here make a noise"". Nothing happened so I said ""Well ok then, take your time"". About two minutes later I heard a knock on the wall. I said ""Do it again"", and it did it again. So by this time I'm amazed and I say ""make a different noise"". Then a scratching sound comes from the walls which kind of freaked me out so I said ""alright I'm going to do some mic checks down there if you want to talk let me know"". As soon as I get down there the lights on stage flicker, so I go to the booth and the board had been messed with. Now your thinking well someone messed with it. No way because I went out the only unlocked door and no one could've climbed through the window then back out in under a minute without anyone seeing them.

I've come to the point where I talk to Carrie when I'm in the booth. Don't get me wrong nothing bad has happened, I think she keeps Steve and I company when we are in the booth.

The Tower Ghost,"California, United States",Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: The Tower Ghost

M y grandparents told me this story. There was a girl who checked in a hotel in california, Salvang, with her parents, this wasn't any ordinary hotel, it was a tower hotel. Well they walked up a couple stair cases because it was the tippy top, when they arrived The parents said ""Uhh... We have to go get dinner!"" so they ran out of the room leaving the girl standing there crying.

They went through a drive-through and went back to the road, there was a man who was driving a car, but he wasn't young, he looked like he was in his 90's and well, the lady totally LOST control and took the wheel from her husband and crashed into his car, they both died, including the old man, but that is just life, you live and die, but this occasion wasn't, she meant to crash in the car damaging the right front car door. Anyway, you ask about the girl?

She was waiting and waiting for her parents to return but they hadn't because they died and they say the girl died of a broken heart, and from now on you can see her looking out the window waiting for her parents to return, of course that is in the suite she stayed in. Time you can see her: Around 12:00a.m.-2:00 a.m.

I know this because my parents checked in that certain hotel and got teased because these teenagers checked into that room, they were telling them, ""Watch out! The ghost will get you!"" as they walked up the stair cases and they say they were so scared they ran out of that room and demanded a refund, they had never returned. They said the girl looked like a shadow moving in slow motion with sound effects: Crying, moaning, and screams.

This is a warning to all of you, don't check in the top of a tower hotel in california, Salvang, there might be an unexpected guess.

Ghostly Experiences,Canada,Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: Ghostly Experiences

W e moved into my house about three years ago it was relatively new, me and my family had been in the house for about three months. This was the first time I had ever seen anything, I was home alone so I was getting ready for school and I saw a young that looked like my sister in the reflection of the mirror in the bathroom. I was soo freaked out that I sat in the bathroom for about five minutes. Since it was the first time I saw anything of the sort I ignored it.

Then after I would see something upstairs in the mirror in the bathroom. The scariest thing that ever happened was when I was in the basement and the remote stopped working so I had to turn off the T.V. Manually, when I bent down and turned of the T.V. And standing behind me was a very tall man, he was like a giant shadow. So I was so scared but I turned around and nothing was there but I felt something following me so I ran out of the house.

My friend across the street just moved in, so we played together. I was alone in all these experiences, so once again I was alone playing darts and I missed the board, and I heard some one laugh at me it was a really girly laugh. It gave me chills. So I turned on the T.V. in fear of hearing any thing else.

One day me and my friend were being silly so we decided to do this ghost investigation, so we took some flash lights into the basement and turned off all the lights in the basement. One of the flash lights went out, we were a little scared so we went upstairs (but left the flashlight downstairs). The next day I went down stairs and the flash light was back on. Then one day I was about to leave my house when someone said my name like they were trying to get my attention. I left the house as fast as I could! There was one day when my friend came for a sleep over and she said the T.V. turned on by itself and she saw two people in the hall way, one really tall man and a young girl. That was kind of scary because she explained them exactly as I have seen them.

There was this weird oooooooh sound that the really fake ghosts make. At first it was sort of funny but then it was scary, so I called my friend. She told me to see if the noise was still there, I got up it was gone then I sat back down. Then she says what was so funny, I was like what... I did not laugh. She says well somebody laughed.

My sister does not lie, and she said that one day a movie came of the shelf and the flew across the room. Then I was in the bathroom and in the corner of my eye I saw something crawling out of my room. It was creepy! One day me and my friend came to my house for lunch and I left a wrapper on the table, it started crinkling in by itself.

The next day we went to her house she has this pen that records stuff and plays it back. We were just recording random stuff then there were these weird whispers.

There's occasional chair moving by itself, and other weird stuff going on!

What's in a Dream,Australia,Psychic / Medium,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Psychic / Medium :: What's in a Dream

F rom the age of 7, I have had what I always assumed to be dreams of dark shadows, they would be beside my bed, and I was and have always been terrified of them. Everything would be just as it was when I went to sleep, so at first I didn't realize I was dreaming. I couldn't move or look away from them, I could hear myself scream and wondered why my mother didn't come to help me, But in time I realized I was dreaming.

Although they were just dark shadows, I always felt I knew what was a male form and what was female, and I had the feeling they wanted to hurt me, over the years I'd fear going to sleep in case I saw them and still to this day I have trouble sleeping.

A psychic once told me that I'm not dreaming, that I have a gift, and these dark shadows are actually spirits trying to make contact with me, the reason I was unable to move was because I had left my body and for a time was one of them and that's why I was able to see them, and that I shouldn't fear them, that I should listen to them, ask them what they want.

I didn't once mention these dreams to her, so as skeptical as I was, I thought to myself, what if she is right, I had to give it a try, maybe my fear of these shadows or spirits, as she had put it, was for nothing, so I slept with the light off until a month or so later I had one of my dreams, I had the worst one I have ever had, I was so scared but I forced myself to stay sleeping, I asked this thing what it wanted but this time the shadow came right up to my face and I saw different colours because it was moving so quickly like a flame swirling around, this thing whatever it was seemed angry, that's what I felt from it, so I tried as hard as I could to wake up and when I did, I felt worn out and my body was tingling, like it was a big effort to wake up and for the rest of the night I stayed awake too terrified to fall back asleep in case I fell back into the dream.

On one occasion I had fallen asleep watching tv and I had the dream even though the lights were on, this had never happened to me before, I hadn't realized I had fallen asleep because the movie I was watching was still playing, but this time they weren't dark shadows, they were a clear fuzz, and I didn't feel scared at first, they seemed like they were so gentle and peaceful, I felt like they were trying to help me.

I had come out of my body, they seemed to be guiding me, but I was sinking through the ground and somehow I knew they were trying to show me how to move above the ground, how to stay up, they were trying to hold my hands to help me up but when I looked over at my body on the couch, they had surrounded it, that's when I got scared, because I remembered what the psychic had told me, she said that not all these spirits are good, some will lie, some will try to prevent me from going back into my body and if they did then I wouldn't wake up, and at the time I had laughed at her thinking she was going over the top with this so called spirit story, but when I saw them surrounding my body, I thought oh no, this is what she was talking about, so I willed myself to stay above the ground and move back toward my body, and forced myself once again to wake, but when I saw the movie I had been watching was still going at the same part I had seen in my dream, I was even more scared, It was like I hadn't missed anything.

I still have these dreams from time to time but not as frequently.

I have been told from other psychics about these dreams I have, and about my psychic ability. Ten years ago my sister came to me with the news that she was pregnant and on that day, I had a quick vision, I saw my sister sitting on a white chair alone, crying next to a white coffin with pink and white flowers on it, so I told our mother that my sister was having a girl and that she was going to die.

My mother got mad at me and told me to keep it quiet. She always thought these visions I had had from a young age, was just me making curses come true, she thought by me saying something that I was just putting a curse on someone. But my mother ended up telling my sister and the rest of the family, and it became a topic of discussion for weeks until we forgot about it.

My niece died when she was 10 months old, from a rare genetic condition. Her coffin was white with pink and white flowers on them, and the only thing that was different was my sister wasn't sitting alone. She came to me the day after the funeral and she said, I didn't pick the the pink and white flowers or the coffin, my mother in law did.

I have seen so many things that have come true, pregnancies, deaths, accidents, sickness and heartbreak. I have feelings of dread but I just never know who or what its about, but 9 times out of ten something happens.

Sometimes my family have asked me, what's going to happen to them, and do I see anything good or bad in their lives, but I can never tell them, because I don't know. These visions can come out of nowhere. I don't will myself to see or feel things.

But it's been years since I saw anything, these visions seemed to have gone. I rarely even feel the feeling of dread anymore.

In saying all of this, I still find it hard to let myself believe I have a gift, I laugh at other people that tell me they get visions and dream of things that come true. I still won't let myself believe that my dreams were actually spirits trying to contact me, its only when I have them, for the rest of that night I'll believe that they were spirits but by morning I laugh at myself and think I'm a fool for believing it.

There are times where I will question it. I have people telling me that they are sure I have some kind of gift, but I just don't know. I don't know if I want it to be real or not.

"A Simple, Subtle Greeting",Canada,Apparitions / Voices / Touches,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Apparitions / Voices / Touches :: A Simple, Subtle Greeting

I 'm a sucker for anything related to the paranormal. My favourite movies involve the paranormal. I love how mysterious it is, how much we don't know. Most of all, I love the thrill of being scared. But to me, this thrill only came from movies and books.

Less than a week ago, my mother brought me and my younger brothers to a location in southern Calgary called the Deane House. This house is nothing new to me, as I had visited it a couple of years previously. My story begins in the attic, the scariest part of the house. The manager told me that a fourteen-year-old boy committed suicide in the attic due to his epilepsy. I don't find this story as entertaining and the lady in the rocking chair, or the bloodstain in the closet, but unlike the other two, this is actually true.

I sat on the porch eating my caesar salad (which tasted like dog poo, by the way) holding my camcorder and listening to the business men and woman at the next table chatter away on the subject of carpets and kitchens. My brothers where running around the old house, and avoiding their doggy-poo salad while my mother sat eagerly awaiting their arrival. Of course, they eventually came, and I was as bored as hell. With the majority of my salad finished I thought, ""Wouldn't it be cool if I spent a while in the attic alone?"" I turned on my camera and started narrating my way up the stairs (""nothing says history like grip tape on the stairs..."")

I came to the attic doorway, slowly twisting the knob as to not damage the door. The boarded floor creaked under each step I took. As I climbed the attic stairs, the creaking was louder. The higher I got, the colder I felt. As I approached the last step at the top I heard somebody say, ""Hi..."" That was it. A simple, subtle greeting. I whizzed around, as if this noise came from directly behind me. I was terrified. My legs shook uncontrollably. A bead of sweat rolled down my forehead. I stood there, body twisted towards the stairs, a terrified look on my face. I was alone. Completely alone. What I heard I cannot explain. I was so scared. It all happened in a matter of 26 seconds, and I caught it all on film. The part that disappoints me was that the ""Hi"" I heard is almost completely silent in the footage yet it sounded so clear to me.

My Childhood Demon,"Mississippi, United States",Old Hags / Night Attacks / Sleep Paralysis,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Old Hags / Night Attacks / Sleep Paralysis :: My Childhood Demon

M y name is India Garmon and I've had the same reoccurring dream since I was about eight years old I am 21 now. When I was younger it used to chase me around my grandfathers yard, now keep in mind that the land we lived on was owned by former slave owners... When I became about 12 it started to get worse it would only happen every once in awhile and when it did I could see my body get up, move into my kitchen or the front door of our own house, just to come upon a loud laughing noise like whatever had been after me all these years knew I was terrified.

When I would wake up I couldn't move, scream nothing I would just lay there in the worst fear of my life until I finally got the nerve to move my hand and yell to my mother. The worst part is sometimes I would think I was awake and scream for her and nothing would come out of my mouth and he would just laugh at me. Every time this would happen no matter where I was I would go to my mother it seemed as if every time I was with her the demon would never come back. It seems as if the only time it comes to me is when I'm really stressed out, vulnerable, or really sick like it knows then that I can't do anything to stop it.

I've tried everything praying, singing and sometimes it will help, but like the people who experience know that to even achieve this task is extremely difficult.

I just had another encounter last night, but I didn't get as scared for some reason this time because a very close friend of mine had told me about sleep paralysis so this time when it started (that loud ringing noise in my ear) I knew what was coming, but it stopped because this time I was curious. I just decided about an hour ago to look up what this was I ran across this page for a reason I thought I was the only one that saw them or could hear the loud laughs, or even the ringing noises in my ear preparing me for what was going to happen.

I'm so happy I am not alone, but it seems the older I get the worse it gets, my childhood chaser decided since I learn ways to get out of its grasp, it wants to choke me. I don't know what to do I can't move, but the mind is a powerful thing and I will fight and figure this out. I know some one that is way more powerful then this childhood demon my LORD and SAVIOR. keep me in your prayers as I will keep you in mine God Bless

My Scarest Experience Yet,"South Carolina, United States",Old Hags / Night Attacks / Sleep Paralysis,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Old Hags / Night Attacks / Sleep Paralysis :: My Scarest Experience Yet

T he experience I about to talk about is my worst yet. I was at work. We have 5 Bases that we work at through out Chesterfield County. This incident took place at Base 2. Since this experience, (a lot of my co-workers have had experiences also) a local paranormal group out of Lancaster came to investigate this particular base I'm going to talk about.

We work 24 hour shifts. My co-worker and I that worked at this base had been working together for about 2 weeks now. The first week, one night I thought he was in room crying. I finally got the nerve to ask him why he was crying the night before and if he was ok. He looked at me like I was crazy and said he had not been crying.

None the less... Time passed and one shift we had been running out behinds off. We finally got in around 2am or so and decided to crash. I remember feeling like someone was standing over me when I all of sudden had awaken for some unknown reason. I chalked this up to the fact that my face was right up against the wall. So I turned my head (I was lying on my belly) and noticed that I wasn't dreaming because the alarm clock said it was 3:21am. I remember thinking ""you have got to be kidding me, I need to go back to sleep in case another call drops"". So as I process this thought, I go to turn over on my back and can't. I know that sounds strange, but that's the only way I can explain it. I thought to myself, maybe I am dreaming... So I look at the alarm again to make sure I am awake... I AM... I try to move again, this time though it feels as if someone is literally lying on the back of me and holding me in place. I cannot even move my head anymore. I try to call for my partner, but nothing comes out of my mouth. I keep trying and I've started crying because I'm petrified and don't understand why I can't move.

Finally a scream of my partners name came out of my mouth. Apparently, I screamed so loud that it scared him and he fell out of his bed getting to me. He opens the door and ask me what is wrong and I tell him I can't move, that there was something holding me down. He say's there is nothing on me. I told him to turn on the light. He does. He sits on the bed, because he realizes I am serious because I am crying. When he sits down beside me, I was able to move. I can't even tell you how fast I got the hell out of that room. I'm not sure, but I think I knocked him out of my way doing so. I can honestly say that is the most scariest feeling I have EVER experienced.

I sat on the couch in the day room and he came over and I told him what had happened. It was then he preceded to tell me of everyone's experiences of this same base. I make him stay on the couch with me with all the lights on until 8am that morning when our shift ended. I still refuse to even go in this room even during the daylight time. Hardly anyone sleeps in this room. There is so much that happens in this building itself that it is amazing in itself. Now don't get me wrong... I thought maybe it was my imagination and that it was the disorder where you wake up before your body actually realizes that your are awake... But my gut feeling knows what happened. I don't believe anything other wise.

I have seen apparitions lately too... I do want to say that I am not alone, nor am I crazy having all these 'things' happen to me. I try to embrace all my experiences, but sometimes I get caught up in all of the skeptics who give you another way of looking at what has happened... Any comments will be gladly accepted... What do you think? Have any of you ever had this type of experience?

Ghost Shouting Out,Australia,Apparitions / Voices / Touches,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Apparitions / Voices / Touches :: Ghost Shouting Out

H ello my name is Dom and I live in Australia. I have had a scary paranormal experience, this is which I would like to share with you so I can understand what this was a demon or a ghost, or any unholy thing not from this world. No harm came to me but it was interesting and freaky.

It was a late night and I was quite worried about going to bed since sleeping at night it a sort of fear I have. I had been into ghosts and demons but I had never seen one. As I was dozing off something shouted right into my ear, it sounded like someone shouted HEY!. My heart started pumping and I was quite worried about what just happened. After 5 minutes I started to doze of again and then again in my ear sounded like a bomb going of. By this stage I was scared of going back to sleep since the shouting might come back. I sat in my bed and suddenly my lamp turned off, (I always sleep with my lamp on). After that my lamp turned back on and then of again very fast about 5 times before it stopped. My lamp was luckily on, my heart was thumping so hard, I was so scared that I ran to my mum and woke her up. Nothing happened again, and I'm looking for answers.

My house has 3 crucifixes and I have a guardian angel and small statue of Mary on the bench next to my bed. For that is the reason I believe this is not a demon. My house is brand new built by us so I do not think anyone died on our property. The only weird thing is that one day when I was in the mirror staring at my eyes I noticed a white glow around me with a blank white head next to mine. I studied this of the internet to be my aura but not sure what the other head was. If anyone knew what the thing was or the head next to mine is can you please comment, thank you for listening.

T he first encounter was about two years ago. I laid on my side, facing my wall-my back turned away from the door. I had just hit sleep mode when I heard a scratch on my mattress, and a little girl laughing in the hallway. I asked my sister the next morning if it was her, and she swears on her grave that it wasnt - and that she heard it too.

The second encounter, my cat and I were sleeping, when a big *BANG* awoke us. I looked up and saw a silver thing floating in the middle of my room - then it dimmed out. I looked at my cat, and she was looking straight at it with eyes opened.

The next few were with my friend and my sister. We were setting up cups and pretending to go to bed so if the ghost was around us, she would trip over the cups. We were pretending to sleep when we heard a sigh of a girl. Another day when she came over, a light-up die kept lighting up, and we weren't touching it.

About a few weeks later, we were recording near my attic in my room, because we believed that's where the ghost lived. It is nailed shut, so each time she comes over we try to open it. We recorded an Australian accent saying, 'Whaddya want to do, mate?"" Something hovered over my friends head that night.

Love Gone Awry,"Louisiana, United States",Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: Love Gone Awry

M y boyfriend Rob and I have always been open-minded and believed in the paranormal. We have lived together in a small two bedroom house in Louisiana for just over a year. Rob lived in the house for a year before I moved in, so for him, this makes just over two years.

Upon moving in, Rob had an Australian Shepherd named Stetson who was deaf. From the beginning, Rob would wake to find Stetson barking, growling, and baring his teeth in the same corner of the living room at nearly the same time every night. Remember, Stetson is deaf, so he wasn't barking at anything he heard. Rob found it alarming because Stetson was a very docile dog. Each night he would carefully console Stetson and return to bed.

As Rob began to get to know the neighbors, the woman next door asked if he was aware of what had taken place in his house. Obviously he was not. The woman informed him that just months before, a young man lived in the house with his girlfriend. One day he returned home to find her in bed with another man. After he found them, the woman and her lover took off in his car. The man was so distraught over losing his girlfriend, that he put a gun to his head and committed suicide, or so it is believed.

The woman who told Rob the story said that she awoke the night of the suicide to a knock at her door from the police around two am. She also claims that she witnessed the scene of the crime, even assisted in cleaning up and repainting. She believed that the man was shot in the bathroom, but somehow ended up in the second bedroom, where he died. She also claims that the cheating girlfriend was once questioned as a suspect for the murder of her boyfriend, but the case was never solved and no one was convicted.

I moved in during January of 2007. In March of 2007, our friend Jeremy moved into the second room before deploying to Iraq. Jeremy's room is the site of the man's death. There is a constant smell within the room that is difficult to describe. We've steam vacuumed, air freshened, opened windows, done everything we could think of, and it continues to smell. It smells damp and earthy. Before Jeremy knew the story of the man who died in the house, he started telling us that at night, he would feel his bed shake from underneath, as if someone was punching the floor up into his bed. He had the type of bed that sat very low to the floor. Needless to say, we told him the story.

Other happenings include the closet door in the hallway between the bathroom and second bedroom. The man would have walked right in front of it. Things in the closet crash to the floor, heavy things like televisions. The door is always opening and closing. At the moment, it's broken off of the hinges. Lights go on and off. Once, an entire six foot bookshelf came crashing to the floor, shattering glass items on the shelf. Rob and I were both on the couch nowhere near the shelf. While passing the living room to go to the bathroom in the middle of the night, Rob and I have seen the figure of a man sitting on the couch staring at the wall. When we look again, he's gone. Rob has seen a shadow pass in front of our alarm clock so that the numbers went completely black for a moment. Small statues on our shelves have been turned completely backward. We've seen someone cross in front of the bathroom door while we shower. We've heard inexplicable music, bangings, knockings, thumps. We always feel people watching. No one is ever there.

There is another thing I should mention. There is a full body apparition of a tall elderly man with silver hair in a black suit and a red tie. At times, he carries a matching black hat, but I've never seen him wear it. The strange thing is that he can't be the man who died in the house. The man who died was around nineteen. This man is nearly seventy it seems. I was the first to see him. One night I wasn't feeling well and was sitting on the bathroom floor in front of the toilet. The bathroom is small and there are no windows, so no shadows are cast into it. Suddenly, I felt a chill and looked up to see the old man standing in the doorway, blocking the entry with his arms folded across his chest. His build filled nearly the entire door frame. He's very tall. I didn't feel threatened, but taken aback. I felt as if he just wanted me to be aware of his presence. He was only there for a few seconds. One night I heard whispering which elevated into what sounded like a party in the 20s or 30s. I heard faint swing music. I got up and went to each room, listened near the windows, opened the front and back doors to listen and see where it was coming from. Each time, it died down. There wasn't any music. The moment I put my head back on the pillow, I head it faintly again. I finally fell asleep feeling psychotic. The man Rob and I have both witnessed on the couch is this elderly man. Before I told Rob of the man standing in the doorway, he had a dream that he was walking through an old house and he saw the same man walk past a doorway and point to the outlines of various crosses that had been burned into the wall. Rob is a crazy sleeper. He talks, tosses, turns, all kinds of things. That night, I remember him pointing to the wall and speaking gibberish. I laughed and went to sleep. The next morning, he told me about the dream and of the man. I nearly died. We had both seen him. After that, he's been everywhere.

We finally mustered up the courage to tell the woman next door of the ""ghost"" in our house. She was surprised and said that a friend of hers was taking pictures in an abandoned house across the street and caught a silhouette of an old man in dark clothing and a hat. We've come to believe that the man may have owned the land long before these houses were built. We've come to the conclusion that we have a residual haunting because he has never seemed aware of our presence. He also looks as if he lived a few decades in the past. His suit is very traditional and simple looking. He isn't active too often and never feels threatening or scary, but Rob and I believe that he was an important man and he wants to continue to feel that way. He may not even realize that he has died. We've attempted to do research on both the old man and have attempted to find out the name of the young man who died in the house, but haven't had any success. We'll be moving soon, and it will be kind of sad leaving our ghost (or ghosts) behind. It's been quite an experience.

Exorcising Demons,"Alabama, United States",Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: Exorcising Demons

M y best friend, I will call her Anna, and I met when we were both in the same fourth grade class at a local private Catholic school. When we were in the fifth grade, Anna who was an only child and who lived with her mother, moved out of her condo and into a newer condo complex. The condo was built like a town house, with three bedrooms and two and a half baths on two levels. It had probably been built sometime in the 1970s.

The condo itself was nice enough amenities wise, but the first time I ever went into that house, I immediately noticed how completely awful it felt inside. Later my mother, who still does not fully believe what happened there, would admit that she also found the house creepy. It seemed to be unnaturally dark in there and it just had this miserable feeling that even permeated the front and back porch. The feeling was not depressing as much as it was ugly. That is the best word I can use to describe the way this condo felt.

Things began to happen immediately. All of Anna's cats turned up missing, I believe there were three in all. One had been hit by a car in front of the condo. This is actually really weird because the front door faced a parking lot with speed bumps everywhere. I have a hard time imagining managing to hit a cat in that place.

Anna also had several pet cockatiels. At some point they decided to give the birds to her grandmother because she and her mother were afraid the birds may die also. The birds were really loud, and after they had been removed from the house, you could still hear them chirping from the room that they had been in. I witnessed this myself and found it particularly creepy.

I often spent the night with Anna on the weekends and we all stayed in the same room together, Anna, her mom and me. We would hear footsteps going up and down the stairs or banging noises in the attic.

Anna and I took showers together in swimsuits because the almost nauseating feeling of being watched was the worst in the shower.

Frequently we would be awoken from our sleep (Anna and I slept in her moms king sized bed with her mom there) to loud breathing and growling noises that seemed to be right by our ears.

One evening, the three of us were in the living room watching the TV. We had left the light on in the upstairs bathroom and Anna's mother asked us to run upstairs and turn it off. We always went everywhere in the house in pairs, particularly at night. I followed behind Anna a few steps as we climbed the stairs. When I got to the first landing, her mother asked me a question. I turned to answer her as Anna continued up the second flight of stairs. Suddenly Anna screamed and rushed past me, back down the stairs. I followed her down. She was crying, but as she explained, not from fear or any emotion, but from pain. Her eyes were red and bloodshot and full of tears. She said that she had looked up to the top of the stairs into the hall and suddenly a huge and brilliant ""whoosh of light"" came at here and burned her eyes. I personally didn't see anything, and as a consequence didn't really believe her, but looking back, it was pretty obvious that something had indeed happened to Anna.

I went ahead upstairs to turn off the bathroom light and Anna went to the couch. Her mom told me not to worry about it, but I felt exhilarated and a little nervous, and actually wanted to go and see if there was anything up there. I told her I would be quick. I darted down the hall to the bathroom and as I passed the guest bedroom door, which was open, I peeked inside. I was facing a standup mirror and inside the mirror I could see small bluish balls of light floating around in the reflection.

Other things that happened included a cyclone of floating garbage from the can in the kitchen. Anna described seeing a ghastly face in a table fan in her bedroom. The fan had been on full speed and just stopped cold and the face appeared. There were also foul smells that would seem to float around the house.

Anna's mother was not wealthy, so they were not able to move immediately, though they did eventually leave as soon as her mother was able to find another place for them to live. In the meantime, her mother began to look for ways to deal with the phenomenon. Obviously, her first stop was the Catholic Church where Anna and I attend grade school. Though our Archdiocese has an Exorcist priest, the Church seemed reluctant to get involved. Anna did however start taking holy water home several times a week.

Her mother was losing patience though, and asked a Baptist minister to come take a look at the house. The man came and while he was there, they heard what sounded like heavy footsteps crashing upstairs. Then it sounded like something crashed through the ceiling and hit the floor in the living room where they were sitting. The thing then ran across the room and threw itself throw the living room picture window. They heard all of these sounds, including the glass breaking, but nothing physically had actually happened. The Baptist minister literally ran out of the house and left, never to be heard from again.

Eventually, the Exorcist priest did come to the house. While he was there, something grabbed Anna's leg and yanked her out of her chair and dragged her across the floor. The Priest witnessed this.

By this time Anna's mother had learned a bit about the house. Apparently an old woman had died after having been pushed by her own daughter down the stairs, and some of the neighbors had heard rumors that before the old woman had lived there, strange people had gatherings in the house in the middle of night. None of this really explained what was going on in the condo, however. It wasn't some big climactic revelation like you see on TV when they discover an Indian burial ground or some such thing.

The priest asked Anna's mother if she had done anything to the house when they had moved in, or if she had noticed anything odd about the house itself, besides the phenomena. Her mother recalled a small metal plaque that had been hung in the threshold of the front door. It had been in a language she was not familiar with. I had seen the plaque too when they had first moved in. It was about the size of a credit card and the letters were in relief. Anna's mother produced the plaque and the priest identified it as a Hebrew blessing. He spent some time in the house and eventually ""diagnosed"" the condo as being infested with something like nine separate Demons. He then replaced the plaque inside the door frame and within a week, the condo was exorcised by the Catholic Church. I don't know what happened during this time. Only her mother was present when the exorcism took place. Anna stayed with her grandmother.

The exorcism was successful for the most part. No more major incidents occurred in the house, though it still had that ugly aura about it. Also, the bad smells and unnatural shadows lingered on. They moved from the condo less then a year later. To this day, Anna doesn't like to talk about what happened when we were kids. I can't say I blame her either.

The Abandoned Rest Home,"North Carolina, United States",Ouija Board / Seances,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Ouija Board / Seances :: The Abandoned Rest Home

T his story is my first experience in becoming a ghost hunter. It was a cold night in February of this year. My brother-in-law tells me of a place he calls ""Ashe Manor..."" He tells me about how it used to be a nice rest home, but is abandoned now.  He tells me about what happened when his girlfriend took him there to experience some 'paranormal activity' - a piano played when no one was touching it.

So, we go to this place and I start asking if there is a presence around that would like itself to be known and also asked other provoking questions too.  We brought an old Ouija Board with us. We asked it who was haunting this building.  The board gave us answers that we later found in file cabinets about a woman who died there named Betty Davis. She died of eating a bad fawn hamburger that made her very ill and supposedly killed her.  We found her room, sat on her bed and talked with her through the board. She was friendly through the board.

After playing Ouija (I promise I don't use this anymore!) we were getting ready to leave because it was getting dark. Noises were here and there, but nothing really unusual other than the creaks of the walls and such... Until my husband says, ""This place isn't haunted. Let's leave... We wasted our time.""  The moment he spoke the last word of that sentence, a loud bang on the wall happened right behind him. We all three heard it and I asked the presence if I could take a picture of it. The only picture that supports paranormal activity is a picture  I took of my brother-in-law near Davis' bed. It looks like a woman looking at him through a purple cup.

We went back to this place once more.  The place was wrecked.  We figured it had been inhabited by people who party by the look of all the beer bottles around.  The feeling at ""Ashe Manor"" this time was negative.  We all felt the negative energy and decided to leave this place alone. I say, ""To the next destination!""

The Shadows in my Room,"Alaska, United States",Apparitions / Voices / Touches,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Apparitions / Voices / Touches :: The Shadows in my Room

I 've had a few experiences ever since I moved to my current house, though not all of them have occurred here. I'm Christian, so I don't believe in ghosts as much as I believe in demons, but sometimes I catch myself doubting that fact in itself.

A few years ago (possibly about two or three, but I can't remember) the blanket I had over my window was taken down in preparation for my blinds to be fixed and actual curtains to be put in place. One night while my window was unblocked, I woke up and sat up in bed and saw a dark figure of a woman standing at the end of my bed, looking out the window. Almost as soon as I sat up, the woman looked at me. I couldn't see any definite features except for the bright yellow/gold eyes she had that I focused in on instantly, but I could definitely tell she was solid because the light was shining on her. Then, almost as immediately as I had stood up, I fell back against my pillows and fell asleep, all while the woman starred at me. The next thing I remembered was my mom opening my door and telling me that I had to wake up.

I didn't experience anything else until a year ago, when I had a dream that I was in my school cafeteria and saw a dark boy sitting off by himself. I didn't notice at the time, but he resembled the woman who was at my window greatly. I sat down next to him and started to talk to him, and when I asked him his name, he smiled at me and wrote on a piece of paper his name, Tye. To this day, I still remember the elegant way his scrawlly hand writing looked on the paper. The next thing I knew, I was walking down the hall when I saw a painting of a shadow with gold eyes that I instantly knew was Tye. I then ran back to the cafeteria where I found all of the lights off and everyone cowering on the floor, all trying to get away from the noises that came from the ceiling. All I could do is look up and think about how I knew it was Tye. I woke up a second later, also to my mom telling me to get up.

Ever since then, I've only talked about these shadows three times; once to my mom while we were watching a Sylvia Brown special on Montel (though I only told her about the woman), then to a close friend while we were at camp, and then to another friend in her room. My first friend joked about how I would probably meet Tye some day and we'd fall in love, but that night I heard voices after lights out. I can't help but wonder if there's something about these shadows that is real, and I'm both curious and scared of this.

My Personal Ghost?,Canada,A Haunted Life,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: A Haunted Life :: My Personal Ghost?

I 'm not sure if all of this counts as proof of my ghost - I have thought maybe I was going crazy but at my old house we used to have a lot of weird experiences. The whole house felt bad to be honest. It was just this uneasy feeling, and a feeling of being watched and not in a good way.

I remember I got to choose which bedroom would be mine when we first went in, and instead of the bigger one I went to the small room at the end of the hall. It just felt nicer than the rest of the house. We had a lot of weird experiences there, a lot of them creepy. None of our pets would ever step foot in the basement, etc. But I'll write those later.

What I really want an opinion on is what I think is my ghost. In this bad house my room always felt safe. Nothing really bothered me past my front door and things I would lose would turn up in very obvious places when I spoke of them out loud. Now, I always joked about the ghosts in the house, and tried to be nice to them in an effort to have them not scare me.

When I moved out, while packing I had ran out of tape - somehow, when I stopped for supper - tape was put in plain sight on top of the last box I had packed. There was only me and my mom there, and she had spent time helping me look for more tape but said there was none. So being me, I said ""ok, thank you ghost - you've always been nice you can come with me if you want"".

Now, when I moved into my apartment both me and my boyfriend would see a shadow, only briefly, move through the hall once in a while and our cats would play with invisible friends as if they were playing with each other. Things would go missing and then turn up when I needed them just like in my old bedroom. Lots of times, but I don't want to take up too much space in this story.

We have since moved again, and once again while leaving (I think I might have a bit of a fondness for it) I said it could come with me. At our new place, the same stuff as usual. Finding things in weird but obvious places, shadows, Lights on and off etc.

What I want to know is, is it possible for the same ghost to follow me? I don't remember any experiences before moving into the bad house when I was about 13. And anyone I was close to had died way before then. I can't tell if it's a guy or a girl, or if they even knew me. It's just this weird sense that it doesn't mean harm. Even if it scares us sometimes with pranks. I'm now 20, so this has been an ongoing thing for many years, and my boyfriend now believes me due to things he's seen or heard and isn't much of a ghost fan.

Our House Became an Open Door,"Indiana, United States",Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: Our House Became an Open Door

A fter dealing with the unknown for years, we finally decided to get a hold of a local paranormal investigative team to check out what is going on in our home and with our children. I e-mailed several teams in the area and was put in contact with a man who was branching out from the team that had trained and nurtured him and we were all excited that he would be able to come out to the house so quickly. He is building his own clientele and we would be amongst his first.

We had thought ourselves lucky to have found a paranormal investigator who was eager to get into our home quickly and assess what was going on around us. I do not know who was more anxious, myself for thinking we would finally have concrete answers (whether it be that we were experiencing mass hallucinations or if there was something here did not matter, I wanted answers) to what we have been living through for years, or our daughter who wanted proof that she is not crazy. She needed that in black and white.

I wrote some friends with his information. I let them know that we were to have an investigation on the first weekend all of the family was off work. I told them of the new occurrences and invited them all to share in the experience from a far as they burned the fires of truth for us while this was going on. We felt that for every one's safety, and at the advice of my husband's Medicine Man, as we do not know what is going on, perhaps they should stay in their homes and provide their support from there.

A few red flags started going up all over the e-mail page on our computer, and in our home. My son said a man with shades on his eyes was going to come to the house and make things hard on us. A newer friend of mine (who is psychic and seems to be extremely knowledgeable, therefore her words carried a heavy weight.) said that it was odd that we were able to get an investigator so soon and that it often times takes months to get things rolling. I decided to do a bit more investigating on HIM to see if there was something else that we should be aware of.

In the meantime this man came to our home with an assistant. One more man was on the way, but he had to stop and pick up more film and was running behind, so the first two men started with out him. The investigator walked around outside the structure to get the feel of the place and to see if there was anything that could be causing the internal noises that are often heard. Finding nothing, but an old man sitting on the front porch, he headed inside.

It was amusing really, the neighborhood stood outdoors watching the parade of people following around this long haired, cowboy boot, bull rider hat with feather wearing man and his assistant. The neighborhood has watched us do some interesting things, and we seem to have the support of most of them. My next door neighbor actually came over when I was placing a circle of salt around the home as we were moving in and wanted to help. We try not to be obvious, but some things are just not easy to hide.

When we got indoors the investigator explained that he would like to do a walk through with just himself and his companion but that he wanted us all to do what we normally do and where we normally do it. So I began supper, my daughter went to her room, my son to his and my hubby hit the computer room. We were all engrossed in what we were doing, but still had a little time to watch the men as they walked through. The house is not big, so they had to pass us a few times.

In the children's wing of the home the television was flickering on and off about every five minutes and their portable radio was going through stations. My daughters closet door was almost vibrating. It was just shaking a bit, not opening or closing, just moving. My son's room had a blue light in the corner of the ceiling (that is the wall that connects to his sisters closet) that seemed to be either gradually growing in strength or decreasing. Doing what we normally do, my daughter asked whatever it was to please stop, she was trying to do her homework.

The third man finally showed up and I almost did not let him in. My son's warning was at the forefront of my mind as I looked at this young man on the other side of my sliding glass door. He was wearing sunglasses and a big cowboy hat. When the other two men walked in the dining room behind me, they told me he was with them and he was alright, so I did let him in.

On the computer my husband was going through the mail and was reading through the answers to my inquest about this man and his ""defect"" from his original team. The information was not comforting and if I would have had this information before they all arrived I would have cancelled, but it was too late for that, so we continued on.

When they left we were told that our place was active and when they came back they would bring the rest of the equipment and begin to shut a few doors and let those free that would go. They felt that perhaps a few would stay as they had a close connection to the children and it might be detrimental to them. What? How is that possible? An existence surrounded by peace or an existence stuck here on earth? Which of those choices would honestly be most detrimental?

Since they have left we have had what I can only describe as an explosion of activity. Musical toys go off with out warning, toys that are put away up in closets so that little hands can not reach them are out in the morning. Cell phones have messages on them from us (I mean they sound like they are our voices) that we did not send. My son sees a figure that is only visible from the waist down. Photographs that are taken in the home are not photo-albumable. The dryer opens and slams in the middle of the night. My husband has a little girl's hand softly placed on his forearm as he sleeps, and has heard her say ""I love you, Daddy..."" And most disturbingly, I have begun to see little shadows walking past my line of vision about three or four feet tall. Never having SEEN anything before, I knew my son was right and something not good happened with the visit of these three men.

We smudged our home. We blessed it, cleansed it, chanted over it and built more fires to ""smoke out"" the entities and then smudged the house again. The lady at the shop that we have been using knows us all by name now, and has begun recommending different things for us.

The main purpose of my telling this story is to warn those of us who do not have a background in investigating and have never seen an investigator at work. When these men came in, they also appear to have brought with them a band of lost souls. For some reason, the souls have stayed on here, and we have tried to release them, but we are still in that process. Please research the team you chose to come into your home. If you start to see the red flags, remember that the color red usually signifies ""Stop"". Do not let your eagerness to be a ""normal"" family blind you to what could happen and protect yourself and your family.

I haven't experienced this, or any paranormal activity (yet), but my grandfather had informed me of his paranormal experience not long ago, and finding this site helpful I decided to post his story.

I do not really know any specific details about this home, but I assume it is quite old since my grandfather used to live there with his mother and many siblings. Due to the amount of siblings my grandfather had had to sleep on a sofa or an armchair. He had been asleep one night when he was awoken by a soft crying noise, terrified he opened his eyes to see a small crying boy in one of the corners. It didn't seem to possess any obvious demonic features, and it looked like a real boy, (I assume my grandfather would have told me if it did) but I'm very sure my grandfather had just closed his eyes and was too frightened to open them again. (after all, I would have too!)

The strange thing is, it sounded much too real to be a dream, and when he woke up the next morning there was a puddle of water where the ""child"" had been. My grandfather being rather logical would have told me if there were any windows or rain the previous night, or any other alternative water sources which could have caused it.

He then told me that he had informed a priest about his experience, the priest had told him that it was the devil, and that the devil sometimes takes the form of a crying child. Is this true?

If you need any more specific details, I'll ask my grandfather for more, just comment and ask!

Any help or information regarding the form of the ""crying child"" would be very much appreciated, since I still ponder about this form. I am a catholic, but I'm very open minded, so don't hesitate to show your opinion! :-)

Headless Priest,Philippines,Apparitions / Voices / Touches,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Apparitions / Voices / Touches :: Headless Priest

W hen I was still living in the Philippines, I went to a private school. I believe that most elders used to scare us little kids about how most of the schools in the Philippines was either, a cemetery or a hospital before it became a school. Basically, it's like telling us that most schools are haunted.

I actually, believed it when the elders told me this, because even when I was still a little kid and when I started going to school, I started seeing things that other people can't see.

Here's the layout of my school in first grade. When you enter the gate, the door is always open and right when you come in, is a big stage. (We pray everyday before we start doing our school work there that's why.)

Well, one day after school, me and my friend were sitting at the steps of the stage because both of our rides didn't come yet. There was no one else but us in the building because most of the teachers were in a room having a meeting. While we were sitting there, nothing to do... We started talking about random things until it got to the point where we started talking about ghosts. Oh yeah, in the back of the school is a catholic church by the way.

All of a sudden something passed by the big door. At first, me and my friends didn't really notice what it was because we were too busy with our conversation. Then all of a sudden, a big wind just hit us. But it was a sunny day. And then when we looked by the door, I saw a man who was dressed like a priest. It was headless, but the mad was holding its own head. I thought I was hallucinating but when I looked at my friend he himself looked really scared. I told him I don't want to talk about ghosts anymore because I'm scared enough already. But he didn't speak a word until ten minutes later.

When he was calmed down, he whispered to me, ""did you see anything passed by the door? Something that's not really usual to you?"". I was shocked. I told him I saw it too. I was thinking what if someone was pulling pranks on us but I don't really think so.

When you get out of the building through the door, If you look in your right is our cafeteria. Me and my friend were so anxious about what we saw we decided to ask the cafeteria lady. But when we asked her, she just looked startled and jokingly, asked us if me and my friend were insane or on drugs, for us to be talking nonsense. So it was only me and my friend who was there.

Oh yeah, there's more stuff that happened to us at this school, this wasn't the first time that I experienced something like this or my friends.

First Grade Experiences,Philippines,Apparitions / Voices / Touches,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Apparitions / Voices / Touches :: First Grade Experiences

i f you have read my other story, Headless Priest , all of the following even occurred at the same school. If you're wondering, I'm just a teenager, but I'm already experiencing all this weird stuff.

This one time, me and my best friend Diane were arguing because of our lunches, then my friend just started yelling out our names and telling us to go to the field. We saw him digging in the ground so we asked him what he's trying to do. He then showed us this tooth. It was a huge fang I believe.

When the teacher saw us, and the tooth, she told us to throw that tooth away because it's somewhat a vampire fang. All of us started laughing because I really believe there's no such thing. So then my friend who dug the tooth, threw it really high. But then his hand just started bleeding out of no where. There were a lot of blood coming out but when he got sent to the nurses' office, he didn't have one mark on his hand. Weird right?

Another time were, my school is separated into two buildings, one is for the elementary and the other one is for high school. Some of the high school boys used to tease me ""white lady"" because I had light skin before. At first, I didn't really care about it, but then it gotten really annoying so I decide to tell my teacher. When we hit lunch she called the 3 boys that kept teasing me and she called us in her class. She then, told us a story about how the same thing happened to one of her students before, and how when the lady died, she haunted the boys that kept teasing her. I really got scared.

When we went back to our lunch, the boys went to the bathroom. Ten minutes later they were screaming and running towards me apologizing. So I asked them what's wrong... They said that when they were in the bathroom, they saw a white lady appear in the mirror. I didn't really believed them at first because I thought they were just trying to scare me because of the fact that I told on them and the scary story that our teacher told us. But they didn't look like they were messing with me. They really looked scared.

There's more, I just really have to go because of school. I'll right a part two of my other experiences later.

Following Ghost,"Minnesota, United States",Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: Following Ghost

I am telling my story of what happened in my room, of the ghost that was following my friend. She is ""sensitive"" and can sense if there is a ghost or no ghost around us. She didn't know that there was a ghost following her, but my mom could sense a joking around ghost following her. So, when my friend spent the night over at my apartment, she found this light-up ball and she was playing with it. She set it down by my stereo speaker (where I have a crystal sitting on to protect my room) and a couple minutes later the ball was on the crystal (no one can touch them or evil spirits can come in). So, I was flipping out on my friend and she was saying that she swear that she didn't put the ball on there. And I was like ""ok whatever I can have my mom bless it again in the morning"".

Then, like, an hour or two goes by and my friend says she just saw a dark shadow in the mirror. Before this all happened I had a demonic spirit trying to hurt me, so I'm freaking out, saying that it's going to come back for me. And my friend is saying ""no it's not, calm down, everything is going to be ok"". I was like, ""ok I'm just going to go to sleep"".

My friend woke me up at five or four thirty in the morning, and she's telling me she couldn't sleep all night. Because she was hearing pacing on the roof. Starting the way the head of the bed was, then walking towards the closet disappearing and then she heard, after the closet pacing, thunder loud bangs by the closet. Then the drawers were opening and closing, then it sounded like someone hitting the wall. And felt a cold feeling in my room.

After she told me all that, we ran out of my room to go tell my mom what happened. She got some sage and sweet grass to burn and re-bless my room. After my mom blessed my room again, we couldn't go back to sleep. So, we just stayed up until me and my mom had to go to visit family because this happened on christmas eve.

Our House in Bound Brook,"New Jersey, United States",Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: Our House in Bound Brook

W hen my grandfather came home from WWII, he purchased land in Bound Brook, a small city in central New Jersey. He built his own house on an empty lot. This lot had only been home to an old barn, which he stripped down to nothing except for the stone basement, which he subsequently buried. The house was built in front of where the barn used to be, and the covered basement became the backyard.

The strange things started when I was five. Being a little girl, and very attached to my mother, I used to sleep in her bed almost every night. I woke up a lot during the night, most of the time because I thought I heard noises. When I would comment on this to my mother, she would tell me that our house was very old, and that it was probably just the house settling at night.

One night, I woke up due to another strange sound, which I can only describe as one heavy footstep. I thought maybe my grandfather had come up the stairs, since he still lived with us, so I sat up and looked expectantly at the door to my mother's room. Instead, I saw a strange man walk into my mother's doorway. He was dressed in overalls and a plain white shirt. We stared at each other for a moment before he spoke to me, in a clear, deep voice. He told me to get out, continuing to stare at me intensely. Since I was a child, I decided that if I stuck my head under the covers, he would obviously leave me alone. I stayed under the covers for a few moments and then raised my head, seeing that he had disappeared. Still scared, I woke my mother and told her exactly what had happened. She simply told me that I had a bad dream, and that I should forget all about it.

Years later, when I sixteen, I brought up the memory to my mother. She seemed uncomfortable about it, and I had to press her to get her own experience. Apparently, many nights she would feel someone get into bed with her and hold her. Thinking it was me, she would turn over to make sure that I was alright, and that I had not had a bad dream. Instead, she would find absolutely no one next to her. I asked her if she believed that I had seen her ""phantom bedmate"" and she finally told me that she believed I had, and it was much more than a bad dream.

Before he died, I asked my grandfather about the ghost that both my mother and I had encountered. My grandfather was not a very superstitious man, but he did not doubt that we had seen something. He told me that many times, in the backyard, he felt that there was someone there with him. He said that many times, when I was too little to remember, I would come running to him from the backyard, crying about ""something scary"" in the backyard, and refusing to go back there. It was then that he told me about the barn, and that he believed that whatever it was had come from there.

Up until the day we moved, I can still remember waking in the middle of the night to noises, and never feeling comfortable in the backyard. I can only hope that the people who live there now aren't bothered, and that someday whatever was in that barn will go away.

Footsteps in my Parents Room,"New Hampshire, United States",Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: Footsteps in my Parents Room

I t was a beautiful summer day until this happened. Sitting at home playing video games and watching t.v. nobody was home but me. What I experienced was very real. In the hour of 4, nobody had still come home. I was expecting my sister to be home any minute. That's when it happened. Footsteps in my parents room. My parents room is above the living room where I was playing games and watching t.v. I didn't notice the footsteps until I had turned the t.v. down. They were scary.

First they walked towards the door. Then back towards the window. So I went up to see if my parents were home. ""Impossible!"" I thought because no cars were home. When I got to the top of the stairs and checked the door it was locked. I knocked on the door and there was no answer. I kept hearing those footsteps downstairs. But at night they were up in the attic. There was actually one time I went up there and the footsteps were gone. But all the nails that were hanging out of the ceiling were now bent.

Another true story was when we were living in my uncle's house. My parents were gone and it was me my sister and her friend. We were sitting down watching a movie and my sister's friend had gotten up to get something to drink, we paused the movie and that's when we heard them. People downstairs in the basement shooting around on the pool table, when me and my sister got up to check nobody was down there. We never heard those sounds again but we were wary of them.

Strange Presence in College Dorm,"Michigan, United States",Psychic / Medium,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Psychic / Medium :: Strange Presence in College Dorm

I live in the dorms on campus at Eastern Michigan University, and, while strange things tend to happen to my roommate, I usually shrug them off. I was raised in a rather nontraditional, psychically-sensitive family, and was brought up to not fear the paranormal, but to respect it and still know how to protect myself from it using shields and simple incantations or rituals. This has always been more or less like second nature to me, and I've never felt truly threatened by any presences around me. Until recently.

Christmas break rolled around this year, and my roommate went home the day after her classes ended. I've slept alone in our room before, and I was leaving as well the next day, so it wasn't a big deal at all. When I went to bed that night, however, things felt somewhat different. I shrugged it off, figuring I was just overtired, and closed my eyes. As soon as I did, I got an exceedingly clear mental image of an older man standing a few feet away from my bed, glaring at me. This was disconcerting, but I just opened my eyes, counted a few sheep to get rid of the lingering image, and then tried once more to go to sleep. After all, it was probably just my imagination - I've seen similar mental images before, ranging from people I've never met in my life to elephants in tutus. Though this wasn't exactly a dancing pachyderm, it was hardly unusual.

But still, I couldn't sleep. I kept getting the feeling that there was something near the foot of my bed, standing in the doorway to my dorm room. This reminded me that I hadn't locked the door before laying down, so I reluctantly stood up to go lock it. I didn't want to walk through those few feet of space - it felt like there was something there that I didn't want anything to do with. I quickly locked up and dove back into bed, closing my eyes tightly. For several long moments, everything seemed okay again.

Several years ago, I began learning how to use my energy to gently influence things — pendulums for the most part, though on occasion, in crowded areas, I would use it to subtly keep people away from my personal space. I could form a barrier that would discourage people, on a subconscious level, from getting too close. I've always done this to some extent, when I was younger, but have only recently begun doing it on purpose. Learning how to do this has made me more aware of my aura, of the energy that surrounds me, and sometimes I can tell when someone is thinking very hard about me, just based off of the changes in my own energy.

I bring this up because I began to sense changes in my aura (I'm not a huge fan of this word, but it most clearly gets across my meaning). It felt like someone was playing with my energy, perhaps sucking it away. This has happened a time or two before, in my bedroom at home, but there, all I need to do is tell it rather forcefully to stop, and it does. I did that in my dorm room, and nothing happened. So I then put up that shield I've been using for so long, but still nothing happened. As I did this, I began to sense a sort of shape that went along with the bad feeling at the foot of my bed. Whatever it was, reminded me of the Velociraptors from Jurassic Park: it was non-human, and somewhat small, but still quite dangerous.

Finally I imagined a sort of energetic bomb going off, filling the room with bright white light, and the being seemed to vanish. I haven't noticed anything out of the ordinary so far now that we're back, but then again, it has only been two days. I'm hoping that whatever it was, it left for good.

The Old Lady and Her Little White Dog,"Michigan, United States",Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: The Old Lady and Her Little White Dog

M y parents bought a small two-story ranch just a few cities over from our old house (The House on Buckingham Street). I was just nine years old at the time, so I spent the remainder of my summer after the move in our backyard playing on the swing set or setting up my new bedroom. My parents had given me the entire upstairs - a light green room with beige carpeting, a big walk-in closet, and two attic doors - one by the landing and one across from my bed.

Like most children today, I had my own TV, which sat on top of my desk just across from the foot of my bed. For whatever reason, I enjoyed watching TV more than I should have, and had a bad habit of leaving it on when I went to bed. I was also very selective about which channels I watched. I hated the news. I didn't particularly care for older or more adult-oriented shows. I always switched between Nickelodeon, Disney, and Cartoon Network, and at night, I would usually fall asleep watching reruns of the Rugrats or Dexter's Laboratory or something. To be perfectly honest, I don't remember exactly what cartoons were on, but I do know that they were bonefied animated cartoons and very popular for the era, and that's all I ever bothered with.

Nothing particularly strange had happened in the house for the first couple of years. I heard my name being called occasionally, even while at school, but once I became fed up with constantly hearing, ""Brittany!"", I yelled for whatever it was to shut up already- that was the end of that. We still had our little Shi-tzu, Mickey, and decided to buy a little white Bicha-poo (Bichon-Frise and Poodle mix) to keep him company, whom we named Fritz. Mickey didn't particularly agree with our reasoning and tended to ignore little Fritz. When he was old enough, Fritz learned to climb the stairs and sometimes he would visit me in my bedroom, but that was a rare opportunity for him because of his size.

But I began to see Fritz in my room more than usual- or at least, I continued to see a little white dog sitting by my feet or sitting in the middle of my floor, and when I'd reach down to pet him, I'd grab at air and realize Fritz was never there. What was more strange is that after a matter of months I caught myself seeing the same little white dog out of the corner of my eye, but Fritz would always be outside or next door or in the basement. I tried to pass it off as nothing, and for awhile it worked. I only saw the dog in a couple of places- anywhere in my room, and in the middle of our living room. I simply assumed that I was so used to seeing Fritz that I simply imagined him around the house when he was gone. End of story.

But then things became a little less easy to ignore. It was night time and I had once again forgotten to turn off my TV before I went to bed- a classic stunt pulled by yours truly. I was awoken at around two in the morning to flashing lights and the sound of a grown man's voice. I opened my eyes to see the television was still on, and it wasn't Nickelodeon, Cartoon Network, or Disney. It was Turner Classic Movies.

Deciding that I must have rolled over onto the remote during my sleep, I turned the TV off and tried to get a bit of shut-eye. But I was awoken again, at almost three in the morning, to find that my TV was on once again, still playing Turner Classic Movies. Frustrated, I shut the TV off and placed the remote as far away from my bed as humanly possible. Finally, sleep!

Four in the morning. I had awoken once again to find that my TV was, in fact, on, but this time it wasn't Turner Classic Movies. Blaring from the TV was the voice of Lucy and I could see the little icon for ""Nick at Nite"" at the bottom of the screen. I actually liked I Love Lucy, but I didn't like that my TV kept turning on by itself throughout the night, usually to channels not meant for my viewing pleasure. I also didn't like that the remote was no longer on the other side of the room where I had put it, but laying neatly on the foot of my bed. I shut the TV off one last time and shoved the thing under my pillow. I'm glad to announce that my television set stayed off (or at least, it didn't wake me up, and the remote remained under my pillow).

At the time, even though I was puzzled by the incident, I ignored it to the best of my ability. I was still trying to convince myself that the little white dog was only a figment of my imagination- one that longed to see Fritz, I assumed, and that I must also sleep-walk. That was clearly the only (and the least frightening) solution to the problem.

About a year or so later, I had been listening to music and reading Wuthering Heights (I know I was only eleven, but I really did enjoy the book). Getting bored but not yet ready to sleep, I decided to pretend I was Catherine Earnshaw and that I was running from Heathcliffe (I wanted to stray from the storyline just a tad), and eventually changed my story completely to being a rock star. This got boring also. I found myself playing with a pair of sunglasses I found in my desk when I heard my mom's voice, loud, but calm, from the bottom of the stairs. She said, ""It's okay, Brittany. Everything will be okay. Don't worry. Everything will be okay"". As she was speaking, I started to walk to the landing, completely confused.

As soon as I peeked around the banister, the voice stopped. No one was there. I climbed down the stairs, ""Mom?"". I assumed she had gotten up to smoke a cigarette or something of the like, so I stood there for a bit, but she never came inside. Her bedroom being right next to where I was, I decided to take a peek, but her door was shut completely and upon opening it, she was fast asleep against the wall.

I mentioned the incident to her the next morning but she thought I was insane, so I dropped that one real quick. I never really came up with an explanation. I wasn't tired. I wasn't thinking about my mom. I wasn't sad. I decided to shove it to the back of my mind for awhile.

Another year passed and my best friend at the time, Dana, had gotten a Ouija board. I had never used one before, but my mom said it was stupid and not to bother (she is usually very defensive regarding things she is afraid of), but Dana started to bring it to my house and eventually we made our own. We started to talk to a person named Lilac (supposing we actually did talk to anyone at all), and decided that she was evil. I don't really remember all the details, but I'm sure a lot of this stemmed from our imagination.

The only things that really stood out, however, was a dream I had that Lilac was walking down a dark street as a white glowing figure, and I was staring down on her from a balcony. It was warm outside and the setting seemed to come straight from Alladin, but I was caught off guard as she suddenly appeared beside me on the balcony and she grabbed me around the neck with the intention of choking me to death. A few days later, as I walking down the stairs, I felt pressure on my back, as if being pushed. I fell down a few steps until my elbow caught the banister. I stayed out of my room for awhile.

I'm not sure if I had imagined that or any of the other experiences. But I do know that the summer before we moved out of that house, I was visiting with a friend who lived down the street from me, and her grandfather was telling me about the history of all the houses on our street.

Because we lived in a suburb, just about every house was built the same as the one next to it, and he was one of the first people to purchase a home there. Then he said, ""Yeah I remember that an old woman once lived in your house, before the family that sold it to you. I can't really remember for sure but I think she had a little white dog...""

The House in the Woods,"Connecticut, United States",Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: The House in the Woods

M y wife and I had been searching for our dream home for almost a year, finally one warm April afternoon we found it. The house was located in a small town near Haddam Ct. Our dream home was miles away from anyone, a long drive down a private dirt road about a mile and a half long through the woods brought us there. There it stood in the clearing, the 11 room three story home was a grand sight. Although, after being vacant for a number of years it needed some attention, the grass was brown, a rusty old chrysler sat in the driveway and there was a murky old pond around the back.

The house had been occupied up until 3 years ago when the owner entered a nursing home, she had passed away a few months ago. We purchased the house from her niece who was heart broken to see it go after being in the family for over 60 years.

We moved in three weeks later. The first day quickly turned to night, it was quiet almost too quiet. My wife was in the kitchen cleaning up after dinner, it was almost 10:00 pm. I went out in the yard to have a cigarette, I heard something moving around in the woods, I thought it might be a possum or something, but for some reason it made me feel very uncomfortable, a feeling came over me that I can't explain, I felt as if I were being watched. I quickly returned to the house and a short while later decided to retire for the night.

I was awaken by a loud thud shortly after 2 am. I sat up in bed and listened, after a few minutes of silence, I heard what sounded like something being dragged across the floor above me. My wife was still asleep, I got out of bed and headed towards the stairs leading to the third floor, as I stood at the bottom of the stairs I could hear the floor boards above creaking. I slowly climbed the stairs, filled with fear my heart beat faster with ever step I took, my chest tightened and heaved with every breath. I was at the top of the stairs staring down the long hallway. The door to the room at the end of the hallway was partially open, I heard what sounded like whispering, paralyzed with fear I couldn't move, couldn't speak, I felt so cold. Suddenly the door flew open, still paralyzed, I found myself staring at a tall figure in a black hooded robe. I suffered a violent headache, my heart felt as if it were going to explode and then everything went black.

I awoke hours later in the hospital, suffering from a fractured skull, 2 broken ribs and a shattered knee. It seems that I passed out and fell down the stairs, all the noise woke my wife who found me at the bottom of the stairs. I told my wife what had transpired on the third floor, she seemed to look at me with a bit of disbelief. I pleaded with her not to go back, there was something very evil there. She blamed the whole ordeal on my habit of sleepwalking, which by the way I haven't done in several years.

After a short stay in the hospital it was time to go home. I reluctantly returned to the house and my wife had helped to convince me that I must have been sleepwalking during a nightmare.

All seemed peaceful, everything was unpacked and I settled on the sofa for some rest. My wife seemed content in the new house and she told me that she set up her sewing/reading room on the third floor and that nothing unusual happened up there, it was just a dream and I needed to get over it.

Over the next few weeks my wife seemed to change, she became very quick tempered and verbally abusive, she has even gone into some very violent tirades and broken things for little or no reason. I still hear noises and feel as if there is something around us, but when I mention this to her she becomes enraged. She spends most of her time in her sewing/reading room and most nights seems to sleep there. She has become quiet and withdrawn, rarely leaving the house and only for long walks in the woods when she does.

She has cut all contacts with family and friends and hasn't ventured off the property in months. The only joy she seems to get is when she feeds the stray dog that comes by every evening, that dog seems to be the only concern to her these days. Our marriage has become very strained and I don't come home very often, I spend most nights at a friends house. I have barely begun to tell most of my story and will be posting it in several chapters. But, my main hope is to convince my wife to leave this wretched house.

My Closet,"Louisiana, United States",Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: My Closet

M y Closet scares the ever loving heck out of me. I'm always scared when I open the door or step inside to make my choices. I put my dresser in there so that I could have a little more room in my bedroom since my closet is a walk-in it wasn't a problem. Well my fear started when a few years ago a boy in my hometown killed himself and the way he did it was he hung himself.

Friends of mine were close to him and I had gone to church with him. We weren't friends or anything but I mean I knew who he was. One day I climbed up on the top of my dresser, seeing as I had to get something down from the shelves that are almost to the ceiling, and all of a sudden I felt as if there was a hand around my throat and I couldn't breathe. I had tears in my eyes and everything as I came down. My cousin was there at the time and she was scared because she saw the look on my face. I didn't know what to do with myself. I was scared and I just looked up to where I had been a few minutes ago and there was nothing weird about it at all. I didn't know what to make of it.

I don't know if it is the fact that that boy had just lost his life... I mean he had been on my mind but I only knew who he was. Or was it something else, something that might have wanted to harm me?! Please let me know what you think about it.

Screaming Kid,"Texas, United States",Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: Screaming Kid

T his happened about 40 years ago in San Antonio, Texas. It was about 5:30 in the afternoon and my parents had gone grocery shopping, along with my brothers and sisters. I did not feel like going so I decided to stay home.

I was on the phone talking to my best friend, when this kid came in through the front door, stood in front of me and just started to scream. I dropped the phone and as I got up the kid ran outside, I tried to chase after him, I was surprised to see the screen door was latched through the inside. I was totally freaked out, I picked up the phone and told my friend Rudy what had just happened and he said he had also heard the scream through the phone. Needless to say I waited outside until my parents came home and relayed the story to them. I described the kid as maybe being about 5 to 6 years old and had Asian features.

My mother told me that on several occasions our neighbor had mentioned to her that she would see a little boy sitting on our front porch, but thought nothing of it thinking it was a relative. That was the first and last time I ever saw this kid.

My parents sold that house to my older sister about 15 years ago and she had it as a rental home but could not keep renters. She eventually sold the house to her son Charles, my nephew.

Charles must have been living there for about six months when I got a call from him asking if I would be available to help him move, I said yes, and asked him why he was moving.

He told me one night he was in bed and heard what sounded like a ball being being bounced around, he got up but saw nothing.

A couple of nights later he was awaken to someone screaming, as he stood up in bed he saw this kid standing at the foot of the bed screaming and after a few seconds just vanished into thin air.

Now when I experienced this at age 13, my sister was 18 years old and unmarried so Charles had not been born yet, and I don't recall ever mentioning what I saw 40 years ago to Charles or anyone else.

I asked Charles if he could describe this kid, he said maybe six years old and he looked Chinese or Japanese but he couldn't be sure as it all happened so fast, but there was no way he was staying in that house.

The house has been sold since then and I have been tempted to go by and ask whoever is living there if they have experienced anything out of the ordinary but I don't want to alarm or scare anyone.

My Would Be Brother and Late Cousin,Canada,Family / Friends Visits,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Family / Friends Visits :: My Would Be Brother and Late Cousin

H ere are 2 stories about my Brother (Paul Tyler Smith) and my cousin (Talicia Campbell). My Would be brother. In 2005 I was told that I was having a brother. But in the stage of birth Paul died. In 2007 I awoke in need of the washroom so I got up and went. As I left the bathroom I heard pitter patter of a child around 2-3 and I saw a little boy running around the house. I asked him who he was and he said ""I am your brother"". After he said that, I ran up and hugged him and 5 seconds later he started crying and for about 10 seconds I was hearing a real high pitched scream so I let him go and covered my ear. As I did that he started to dissolve and by this time I started getting scared and tried getting him back because I was really looking foreword to him and ever since then, I never left my room before 6 am and after 12 midnight.

My late Cousin. In 2005 my cousin Talicia Campbell died by being ran over by a train. About a week later I heard a knock on the door. Someone said ""Hi Cody"" and it sounded like Talicia but I knew she was gone. So I thought I was just hearing things so I went back to watching TV. Then I heard footsteps of someone around 16. And I looked where it was coming from. I saw my cousin walking into my parents room (this was before they split). I again thought I was hallucinating. I went to my parents bedroom and saw the blanket with a lumpish thing like someone was sleeping there (my parents were both at work at the time). And I lifted the blanket up and saw nothing. I looked in the mirror and saw a shadowy figure lying down. Then it moved as if it just woke up and saw me then left.

My Child Talks with a Stranger,"North Carolina, United States",Children Who See Spirits,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Children Who See Spirits :: My Child Talks with a Stranger

M y name is Andrea and I am a single mother of a two year old little girl. I moved into my home eight years ago while engaged to my now ex-husband. Elderly neighbors explained to me that our community was originally built in the 50's. The houses were intended for War Veterans returning to the states to have affordable housing.

I had lived in the home a little over a year and decided that I would love to have a small dog for companionship while my husband worked late. It wasn't long after the 8 month old pup started barking viciously down the hallway facing the door which is now my daughters room. The hair on the back of her neck would stand up and she would shake uncontrollably. The bedroom at this time only served as a guest room and storage for extra clothes. The dog who would never leave my side anywhere I went in the house, refused to enter this room. I could never understand why? I knew that some dogs just have funny little ""quirks"" about them and just wrote it off as such.

Years passed and I never gave my little dog Clea's behavior much attention. However, one night in particular I was watching T.V. with my little pug sitting on my lap. She started shaking and I looked down at her and every hair on the back of her neck was standing up.

She coward on my lap and begin licking her lips in submissive behavior. I ""baby talked"" her trying to relax her while trying to look and see what had upset her so badly. I turned my head and saw nothing. Clea jumped out of my lap onto the back of our couch and began barking ferociously to the point she bit her tongue. I have to admit this scared my terribly. Who or what was doing this to my dog? What does she see that I can't! I paced the house nervously until my husband arrived home. He could tell that I was very upset but laughed at me when I told him of our encounter. He stated ""you girls have been up to late watching crazy movies"". This occurred again on several occasions after that night even with him present. He never gave it a second thought and would scald our dog every time she behaved this way.

In the summer of 2004 I was informed by my doctor that I was pregnant. My husband at this time was having an affair that I was not aware of until I was 7 months pregnant. We had a horrible fight that night over his adulterous behavior. I made him leave that night, I couldn't bare to see his face. Minutes after he left the driveway I began crying hysterically on my couch. My dog Clea was lying beside me when she began the curled lip growling again. I look up and the pendants over my bar were swinging in small circles. My nerves were already shot and words began coming out of my mouth that I would never say if I was in a calm state. ""If you are here to hurt me go ahead and get it over with, can't you see I am in enough pain!"" The pendants immediately stopped moving and my little dog chased whatever it was down the hallway until she came to the door and then ran back to me. The incidents seemed to stop completely after that night.

The birth of my daughter took my mind off of all that had happened. The room that my little dog hated was now a sweet nursery for my new baby girl. But, my little baby did not care for the room either. She would cry every time I would lay her down in her crib. I ended buying a bassinnette for my room and she would sleep all night long, except waking up for feedings. As she grew older she would go into the room to get toys and books. At times she would look up toward the ceiling and reach her arms up as if someone was there. This scared me. What and who is in this room and why! Needless to say my daughter sleeps with me.

My sister who is a pharmacist assistant watched my daughter for me one day while I was running errands. She heard my daughter talking to someone and went to investigate. Her aunt asked her who are you talking to little-bit? My daughter responded, him and pointed beside of her. ""He plays with me and he lives in this room"". My sister who was an MP in the Navy grabbed my daughters arm and left my house with all of the lights on and unlocked!

The latest incident and the very reason I am writing this story is because of what happened just two days ago. My cousin and I were sitting in the living room with her son who is two months older than my daughter. My little girl was in her room and began yelling and screaming at the top of her lungs. She ran into the living room to show us her arm. It was red and whelped! I remained calm and asked her what happened. She said mom, ""He told me to stay out of my closet and that I couldn't have my blue scarf""! I asked her who are you talking about your cousin has been in her with us? No mommy the man that lives in my room, he said I can't have my scarf because I wrapped it around my neck to tight last time and you put me in time out. My heart felt like it was in my throat! This man in her room understood what went on in our household! He heard me telling my daughter to never wrap things around her neck that she could strangle herself! My cousin became just as upset as me and would not let her son play in the room. They left shortly after this happened.

The next day she and her son returned, I am a nurse's assistant and she had to come by to get her weekly shot. Her son went into the playroom and we could hear him talking. She jumped up and ran down my hallway. There was her son standing in the middle of the room laughing and talking as if someone were ""picking"" with him looking in the opposite direction of us. Again she left with an odd look on her face. She called me later that night to tell me of her son's experience at my house. He wanted to come back and play with the man at my house!

I have to admit that I am a little scared. Who or what is in that room and why? He doesn't seem to be evil or really bother us. My daughter is afraid of the dark now when she never has been in the past. Is it because she can see him in the dark and it startles her? How can two children who are less than three years old give the same description of a man that we can't see. They are too little to make this up. My little dog who I am  sad to say has passed on knew he has been here. I am currently trying to locate the original owners of this house to find out who he might be. Wish me luck...

It's Wasn't my Mom,"Texas, United States",Old Hags / Night Attacks / Sleep Paralysis,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Old Hags / Night Attacks / Sleep Paralysis :: It's Wasn't my Mom

I woke up one Thursday unable to go back to sleep. I didn't bother to check the time because I was sure that it was almost time for school. Facing my wall I laid in my bed waiting for my mom to come in and wake me up for school. Suddenly, I heard my door open. I was sure it was my door because my door is made of metal and makes a big clanking noise when you touch it. Footsteps neared my bed, but I didn't turn around because I was sure it was my mom.

Then I felt someone sit on my bed, I could feel the person's weight on my bed and their body on my legs. I closed my eyes tight and hoped that my mom would let me sleep a little longer... But she did not say anything. After about one minute of sitting there the person got up. The weight lifted off and I heard more footsteps and finally my door closing again. I went back to sleep and when I woke, it was because my mom had come to wake me.

I asked her about the night... If she had come in... She said she hadn't gotten up all night, still confused I asked my dad; he had not gotten up either. So then I knew that something else was in my room that night. Still, my cousin spent the night a few weeks later he slept on the living room couch.

In the morning he told us that he felt someone sit on the couch while he lay awake in the middle of the night. Unlike me, he turned to see what it was. He said he saw a dark silhouette sitting on the couch. He wrapped himself in the covers and hoped to sleep again. Freaky!

The Visits of Den Den,"Oklahoma, United States",Children Who See Spirits,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Children Who See Spirits :: The Visits of Den Den

M e and my wife Judy are living in a house we are buying. We have been here for about 4 years. We have 6 grand kids. The one that I'm telling about is Chloe. One day while her and her brother were staying with us I heard Chloe in the play room talking with someone. Her brother was out riding her bike and her grandma was at work. I asked who she was talking to. She told me Den Den. Now I just dismissed this as her imaginary friend or something. You know how 4 year olds are. Well I told her OK and went back to what I was doing.

Later that night her and her brother were going to bed, they kissed me and their grandma goodnight and walked to their room to go to bed. I heard Chloe tell Den Den good night. I just laughed and told her grandma what happened earlier.

Well about an hour later grandma went to bed. I stayed up watching T.V. About an hour later I heard footsteps coming down the hall and the bathroom door close. I thought grandma had got up and went in there. I waited for her to come in the living room. Twenty minutes passed and she never came out, so I went to look. The bathroom door was still closed and my wife was sound asleep in bed. Where my chair sits in the living room I can't see down the hall. But I know the sound of someone walking down the hall.

On another occasion my wife was taking a nap on the bed. I again was in my chair in the living room. I heard a loud click from down the hall and her the fan next to the bed quit running. My wife woke when the fan stopped and yelled for me. I thought the breaker had blown. I checked the breaker box which is in the bedroom. Noting was tripped. As I was walking out of the bedroom I noticed the switch on the wall that controls all the outlets on the wall the fan was on was turned off. Now this switch is rather stiff and can't be flipped easily, besides me and my wife were the only ones home.

The switch has been turned off on one other occasion. But it seems these thing happen after Chloe has been here. I haven't heard her talking to Den Den in a while but she told her daddy about him.

I Heard People Walking,Australia,Apparitions / Voices / Touches,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Apparitions / Voices / Touches :: I Heard People Walking

T his is my second story, my first was Ghost Shouting Out . Well I suggest you read my first story, if not you won't really know much about me, the only thing I can say there is a white face next to my face in my aura when I look in the mirror. This happened the night that I wrote my story.

I was lying In my bed around 11:00 when I heard people talking in my living room. I kept hearing people and I suddenly went to investigate. As soon as I got to the living room no one was there. Now I was terrified for this being my second paranormal thing to happen, I decided to go back to bed, I kept trying but still heard people talking in my living room. I kept getting up to go investigate and yet again found nothing.

It was now 1:00am and I was slowly dozing off when I heard someone walking in the hallway and my heart started thumping because the footsteps came right outside my open door. I could not see the hall, I had to step out of my room to see it. Now I went and stood near my sisters door and told her everything, she didn't believe me and I went to watch a movie.

It was 2:00am now and I went to try and go back to sleep, yet again I heard someone walking in the hallway but I forgot about it and fell asleep. In the morning I woke up at about 11:00am and my printer light was flashing. I didn't think anything of it and by 5:00pm that day my sister came back from work and said, ""I heard footsteps in the hall as well and I thought it was you but you were asleep"".

This is terrifying but when I fall asleep I think of doing something fun, Thank you for reading.

A  Client's Vision,"Indiana, United States",Misc,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Misc :: A  Client's Vision

I work as a In Home Companion for a reputable retirement community. Our main goal is to allow our clients the opportunity to live within their own homes, or the home of a family member and not be forced into the ""system"" and ultimately into nursing homes. We go into the homes and either clean, cook, visit or just read our clients mail to them, anything that they can no longer do on their own. In keeping with our confidentiality practice, I will name my client Sophie.

I had not met Sophie before the night that I was hired to sit with her until her daughter and son-in-law came home from a concert. This was the first time in years that the daughter had taken time out for herself, so it was a bit difficult herding her out the door in the first place. It is often difficult for the primary caregiver to think that it is alright to leave their loved one in the hands of someone else, even if they are two steps away from a nervous breakdown. The responsibility gene kicks in and they feel, in general, that their own sanity is a small price to pay for the comfort of their ward.

We had an uneventful evening. I made Sophie a small meal and we just talked, and at her request, I read to her out of the Holy Bible. Shortly afterward we began a discussion that should make it on this site, but I can not bring myself to do that. Sophie was ninety-seven and the history that she lived was a magnet to me. I could not stop asking questions in between rest periods. She was amazing and her mind was as sharp as any I have had the fortune of testing.

Sophie told me that when the family brought her the list of candidates for the babysitting of that night, she set the list on her stomach as she lay in bed, placed her hand over the names, closed her eyes and just blanked out her thoughts until a name came to her. What she came up with was a last name. But it was not my last name.

The family called my manager and asked for a caregiver with the name that Sophie chose. They apologized to my manager and explained that Sophie would not let anyone but the person who had that name stay in her house alone with her. My manager and the family were understandably upset as there was no one of that name on the payroll. The daughter really needed a time out, so they tried to come up with a different solution, and thought to deceive Sophie into thinking one of the caregivers had that name.

The next day, my manager told me that I would not be going to Sophie's house and explained why. She mentioned the name and I just stared at her. My application only shows my married name. The name that Sophie had in her mind was none other than my maiden name.

Near the end of the evening together, I went to make her a light snack and get a drink ready for her bedside table. I was out of her sight for approximately twenty minutes, just peeking in to make sure everything was still good. As I stood in Sophie's doorway to ask if she would like anything else before bed, she asked me why I walked out on her earlier. I knew I had been in the kitchen and so I asked her what she meant.

Minutes before I was to walk back into her bedroom a light colored clothed individual was visiting with her in the room. In my job I wear a very light green scrub suit, so I thought perhaps her mind had wandered back a few more minutes than usual and thought to tell her that I did not walk out, and I was sorry if I had in the middle of a conversation.

I prepared her night clothes and took her in for the nightly bathroom process and returned her to her room. I then took the dog out for a short walk. When I got back in the home I checked in on Sophie and she again asked why I left in the middle of a conversation. I was at a loss. I had no idea what was going on and tried to calm Sophie down by telling her that a lot was on my mind and I thought the conversation was over and apologized. As I was outside the home, I knew it was not me that she saw, but could come up with no explanation.

I thought perhaps she was stressed as this was the first time in a while someone else was caring for her instead of her daughter. I stood in her doorway and asked if I should perhaps turn on the overhead lights instead of leaving just the Christmas lights on. She loved the glow that the lights gave off and only wanted those lights all over the home on.

Sophie then shuddered so violently I thought she was having a seizure. She whipped her head to the left so that she was no longer looking at me, but towards the outside window. I ran to her side and grabbed her hand. She refused to look at me, or even turn her head my way. I asked her what was wrong, what could I do to help? All she did was lift up her right arm, point her finger out the room into the hall and said ""What do you see out there?"".

I chilled. Shivers went up and down the entire length of my body and I struggled with myself to actually turn around. I closed my eyes, looked down at Sophie and all of my Motherly instincts kicked in. I was going to protect this little lady if it was the last thing I was able to do. I wanted to call my family to tell them I loved them all, I wanted to right all the wrongs of the day, but I did NOT want to look out that door and see that someone had come in while I was out walking Sophie's dog.

Hanging above her ""down"" stairs was an Autumn wreath with dried flowers and grasses, beautiful really, but that was all I saw. She told me to look in the wreath. I did, nothing. I handed her glasses to her and asked if it was still there, and yes it was. I asked for a description. Her hand tightened in mine and she said ""He looks lovely. More like a country sunset makes you feel than anything else wondrous..."" I thought, Well, crud, what is it?

She fell asleep shortly thereafter with me holding her hand and staying by her side while glancing out in the hall repeatedly. As her breathing became heavier I said out loud: ""If you are here to scare Sophie, I have to ask you to leave. We do not want you here. If you are here to take Sophie, I am afraid I can not stop you, but please do it in peace...""

The next morning my manager called and let me know that Sophie had passed on several hours after I left her home. She had died in her sleep with a smile on her lips and a content sigh. I have often wondered, since then, what drew her to me and how did she know my name having never met me? Most importantly I wonder if I was what she needed that night, and not only who she wanted.

Strange Knocks 2,"Florida, United States",Poltergeists / Physical Manifestations,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Poltergeists / Physical Manifestations :: Strange Knocks 2

I t's been a few weeks now and I have updates on what's been going on. The knocking has slowed down a lot but I have a new thing going on. A few days after christmas for whatever reason a fuse blew and knocked the power out to half of my house, now where the stuff is going on is the side that was not affected. So we fix the fuse and later I'm in the kitchen cooking supper, and the microwave turned on by itself. Well I thought it had to do with the power earlier that day but thinking about it, the kitchen was not affected, and I just blew it off as a fluke.

Then about 5:00am I hear it going off so I get up and look, the light was on, well I can't explain that away so I went back to bed. This keeps going on for a day or two between 4 and 5 am, so I told my husband about 2 weeks later what was going on and he blows it off like nothing, until my niece tana woke us up on friday morning to ask why the microwave was going off, I looked at Tim and told him to explain what happened, and he could not find a logical explanation for it.

So for now at night I leave the door to the microwave open. Really I don't know if it is part of what's been going on or if it is just a malfunction with the microwave, but it's never happened before. I am just curious if anyone has a good guess on this?

The Row Boat,"Connecticut, United States",Family / Friends Visits,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Family / Friends Visits :: The Row Boat

T his true account was told to me by my late great-grandmother Estelle Drakeford. This is a true story. My great-grandmother's parents both past when she was in 5th grade. All seven children were split up and sent to different relatives on the East coast to live. My great-grandmother by that time was 14 and married.

One night while she was sleeping, she told me her door opened and in came like a cloud of fog of some sort. Then a boat appeared and inside the boat rowing was her mother. The woman said ""Estelle, your little sister Janie is in trouble. You take all your money from the bank and send for her"". Then just like that she was gone.

Now listening to my great-grandmother I had chills running down my spine because by the look in her eyes I knew this was true.

My great-grandmother said the next day she took all her money and sent for her sister but it was too late. Her sister was already deaf. The relative my great-aunt Janie was sent to beat her over the head with a broom so many times that her ear drum was shattered.

I tell this story to people because if my great-grandmother would have dismissed this sighting of her mother as a dream, my aunt could be dead right now. If you ever get a vision, or a feeling, or just something that you yourself cannot explain, then its probably worth checking into.

I myself have experienced something similar too this but I guess you well have too wait until I write it. Thanks for reading.

"Marietta, Georgia Ghost","Georgia, United States",Apparitions / Voices / Touches,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Apparitions / Voices / Touches :: Marietta, Georgia Ghost

A ugust 5, 1997. I was driving home one night with my wife and baby son in the car. We were going through Marietta trying to get home to Fair Oaks, having only lived in the area for a week or so. I figured out where I should turn, and I made a left and went past six or seven large houses on my side of the road, and on the far side I couldn't see much but trees and then possibly a glimpse of what I then realized must be a cemetery.

As we were coming up to being level with the entrance to the cemetery, I saw a small figure stood in the middle of the road. My instant reaction was to hit the brakes, but I wasn't fast enough and shut my eyes quickly, thinking that I was about to run over someone.

I heard nothing. I was expecting a thump, or a scream, or at least some indication that I had hit something. I stopped to car, awaking my wife, who questioned why I had stopped. I told her that I saw someone, and she said nothing. I got out the car and went to the rough spot where I thought the person was stood. I gave the house next to me a quick glance and saw lights on inside, so I decided it was best to get going again.

I drove in silence, and my wife continued to question me about what happened. I told her that I saw someone quite short stood in the road. She obviously thought I was tired and when we finally got home I fell straight asleep. That night I dreamed.

My dream was almost exactly the same experience I had. My wife wasn't in the car, but my son was. I turned onto the exact same road where I had seen the ghost (I always call it a ghost seems as it can't have been real). I drove exactly where I had been earlier, but this time I saw just a snippet of the person I hit. I think it was a girl, I saw pastel pink clothing with lines in the fabric, and it was quite loose and baggy but not too big. But her face was different. I saw one flash - not even a second - steely grey eyes but they were very round and innocent, and she had a large forehead. I think her hair was blonde but it was very messy and I didn't really see it. Then I saw her again and her eyes looked brown - rounder and fuller. Then I close my eyes (in the dream obviously) and that was it. I got out the car and saw my wife lying in the road - what I saw has stayed with me a long time - she was wearing her work clothes, and quite a long, black coat. Her face was covered with her hair and her eyes were closed. She was smiling, but then she almost dissolved - like an aspirin does in water, from the edges inward. Then I heard a child's voice, and it said something like ""I want to be...ROURKE!"" Rourke is the only word I can think of that quite fits what he or she said (it sounded like a girl).

I woke up the next morning feeling a lot better for some reason, but I never told my wife about that dream. I guess she forgot about that night too, so I never brought it up again.

I went back to the cemetery the next day and found it almost deserted - just an old man sat under a tree on a small bench, so I moved on. I found nothing of interest in there, so I turned around and went home again after about ten steps. I haven't really thought much about my experience since, but I always think I saw a ghost.

Animals that Have Passed,"Louisiana, United States",Pets / Animals,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Pets / Animals :: Animals that Have Passed

T his isn't a scary story at all! I actually look forward to these things, every now and then you can feel the brush of what would feel like a dog or cat snuggling up to your legs. All you have to do is just look down and reach down there and it stops. But I think it's real cute. In the house before we moved in, the previous owners dog died there and I THINK is buried in the back yard. And then in July, bless my little girls soul, my puppy Nicco died there. She was very old and had lived a long good life. But it's sweet I think she came back to still live with us. At least I hope so because I would LOVE that!

She use to sleep with me at night and sometimes when I move my legs around I can feel a spot in the bed that is indented where I can't move my legs over and I have to pick it up and go around. When she was alive she use to make me lay on my back and she use to sleep between my legs or she would snuggle up real close to the top of my body and we would both sleep on our sides.

Her and I were really close, I had been having her since I was 2 years old. She was the sweetest dog ever and fun! Poor baby couldn't walk very well towards the end of her life, and every now and then you hear little doggie footsteps and you just look at where they are coming from and just smile because I know my baby girl is home to stay.

We also had a cat Kitty Mervin that got hit by a car on one of the near by streets. It was a cat that we took in after one of my friends moms told her that she couldn't keep it. So we took her, she was a sweet cat, but like some cats, she got real moody and never wanted anything to do with anyone. Needless to say sometimes you can hear cats fighting outside, and don't get me wrong there are lots of cats around my house, but when you go outside to stop them because we think that we hear them on the back deck there is nothing there.

Sometimes I wonder if it's her or I just think that I might be hearing them from somewhere else. Also the cat I have now will sit in certain spots and not move and just stare at a certain area. Like he sits outside my bathroom door and just looks into the dark room straight ahead. Sometimes he freaks me out because he gets all scared and just sits there. Punkin and Kitty Mervin didn't really get along, ok well not at all.

I really don't know what to think of it all. Help me if you can, please! :)

Grandma Needs Help,"Texas, United States",Misc,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Misc :: Grandma Needs Help

M y grandma was very ill as an old lady. She had diabetes and was always in pain. Other than that, she would go to the hospital very often because she needed pills and treatment. I remember going to the hospital almost every weekend with my cousins and sister to help watch my grandma and translate for her if she had something to tell the doctor and nurses.

The memory that stayed with me the most until now was during my grandma's last stay at the hospital, which was also her last couple of months she had left that no one knew. I was alone with my grandma and my younger sister had went to go get a snack to eat. My grandma was making a fuss and then started to say, ""Come help me doctor..."" I looked at the door and no one was there. I started to get freaked out and told her there was no one there, but she insisted there was. Then she started to pull on her IV to get it out. I held her hand to get her to stop and before I knew it, the IV came out. The weird thing was that she did not even pulled the IV hard enough to get it out. I got worried so I called the nurses, and then I looked at where she was talking to and said, ""Help my grandma...""

When the nurses came they strapped my grandma down to put the IV back, and by then my younger sister was already back. My grandma was struggling and did not want the IV in her. When things couldn't get worse, I started to laugh SO hard out of nowhere and began to get light-headed and dizzy. I know I shouldn't had laugh after seeing my grandma being tied like a crazy person, but it was almost as if something came over me. And when my grandma saw me laughing, she looked at me very strange almost as if I was someone else.

Thinking back to that day, it still creeps me out; especially the look on my grandma's eyes when she saw me laughing so cruelly. She had never look at me like that before and never did again. I still wonder who my grandma saw that day and what came over me to make me do that...

Shadow Spirits and Black Animals,"Texas, United States",Misc,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Misc :: Shadow Spirits and Black Animals

O ne Summer, my parents and I went to San Antonio, Texas to get away from people and problems. We decided to go to the Riverside Mall and look around. It seemed like a normal day, nothing out of the ordinary. But then we went outside to walk along the ""river..."" Among a small group of pigeons was the strangest pigeon I've ever seen! The pigeon was completely black! I stared at it as we walked past, and it stared back. Some of the other pigeons flew away in fright, but the black pigeon didn't budge.

That night, we went back to the Riverwalk for dinner. The river water looked pitch black in the darkness, and I had no way of knowing how deep the water was. I'm not very good at swimming at all, and I'm terrified of drowning, so I kept a wary eye on the water. On the river's edge was another black pigeon, staring and watching as I passed by.

It reminded me of a time, years ago, when I was in elementary school. My mom was going to drop me off at school, and we were almost there. I stared out the window toward some houses. A fluffy black cat was trotting across people's yards, staring at me and keeping pace with the car. My mom was driving slowly, of course. I glanced away for a mere moment, and when I looked back out the window, the cat had vanished.

Some time after our trip to San Antonio, my mother's parents moved in with us. While I was on the computer, someone's shadow shifted over the right side of the computer screen. When I looked directly at the shadow, it quickly moved into another shadow to disappear, and I turned around to look behind me. No one was there. The next day, I overheard my mom complaining to her mom about seeing a shadow out of the corner of her eye.

She said ""I used to see them all the time when I was little, and sometimes they came as a black animal! You two must have brought them with you!""

Several days later, when I got home from school and my mom got home from work, my grandma told us that she had done the laundry and left the basket of clean clothes on the couch in the den. Technically, the den and the kitchen are the same room, but we divided them into two rooms with an imaginary line. Grandpa Derrel and grandma were sitting in the kitchen, when grandma saw a human-shaped shadow out of the corner of her eye. The next thing they knew, the clothes basket flew off of the couch and across the den.

My friend Carol was living with us, too. I had to share my room with her. She swears she saw a shadow out of the corner of her eye and that it tried to punch her in the face. I called the shadows ""shadow spirits,"" and when my grandparents moved out, we stopped seeing the shadow spirits.

Schwartz House,"Texas, United States",Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: Schwartz House

I haven't written to this site in awhile but it's slow at work so here we go. When my father was a small child in Ft Worth, TX his family lived on the ""North-side"" area of town, which was at the time a middle class area with a high Hispanic population. My dad was a typical kid of his times and played outdoors from morning until night. My family has a tendency to have experiences with the paranormal and most of the family stories started at the ""Schwartz house"" my father lived in from the time he was small until my Grandparents sold it in the early 1990's.

My grandparents raised a large Hispanic family, five children; and both worked. My aunts and uncles would be at home alone without adults a lot of the time, mostly causing trouble. I've always been told stories about the ""Schwartz House"" from most of my Aunt's and Uncles because the entire family experienced the weirdness. My Father in particular is adamant about a story that happened when he was approx six or seven years old.

It had been late in the evening and the family was getting ready for the next day and heading to bed. My father had a little league baseball game the next day and he had forgotten his cleats in the living-room area of the house, which had already been darkened. My grandmother was in the kitchen area of the house doing the dishes. This was the late 1950's early 1960's and dishwashers were not in the picture of affordability yet.

My father walked into the living-room of the house and he swears to this day that he saw a beautiful pair of female hands and forearms glowing in the darkness. The hands gestured as if opening a book and then faded into the darkness. My dad being freaked out like you read about ran like a mad man to his mother in the kitchen. My grandmother who was and is a tough old bird, despite being less than five feet tall, walked into the living-room and checked things out for her baby and told him there was nothing there.

Dad says that the hands were the most beautiful hands he had ever seen. He remembers the nails being perfectly shaped and the skin being almost luminescent and pale. He never saw the hands again but he did experience other things at that house during his childhood.

My Uncle Reaching Out to Us,"Massachusetts, United States",Family / Friends Visits,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Family / Friends Visits :: My Uncle Reaching Out to Us

M y mom has always just had feels about things. She's intuitive and just always is right (not just in the motherly sense). She sees shadows and mists and even people. She comes from a big family and none of her siblings have been close ever since a matriarchal grandmother died in 1997.

Even before my gram's death, her siblings had a hard time especially the black sheep of the clan, my uncle Gene. My mother and Gene were very close being the two youngest. Gene followed in his father's footsteps doing construction by day and being a firefighter by night. He was so proud to make this comeback and fighting his addictions after time in rehab. He was proud to be an uncle. He was a big kid himself being a prankster of all sorts, played piano while we danced and sang with him, taught us songs, sang ""oldies"" to us that he loved, believed in ghosts and told us stories, and pretty much took us all over boston.

We moved to maine in 1998 making it difficult to see family in general but he still sent christmas, birthday, anniversary cards every year and visited when he could. Gene was always there for you, just the kind of guy you want to have around.

Unfortunately his addictions came back in recent years and he stopped talking and being close with all of us including my mom. It devastated her. The last time I talked to him was christmas and he was mad at me for not calling him and telling him about college. He didn't sent us birthday cards that spring, so my mom called to make sure he was okay. He never called back. While I made plans to move into my new apartment, my mom one day turned to me and said, ""Something is wrong. I just know it us. I think something's wrong with Gene"". Now, as I was saying my mom feels stuff and sees spirits but she gave a look my mother does get and in a tone I'd never heard from my mother in the years I've known her.

On July 3, 2007 I came home from work to my mom bewilder. She said something is wrong with Gene and we needed to go to boston. My mom and I started on our three hour trip. All the songs it seemed on the radio were songs that either my uncle played or sang or went to concerts with my mom. Just a weird trip.

Right as we came onto the tobin bridge in boston jim croce ""time in a bottle"" came on. It was 8:21pm. My mom looked at me. When the song was over I started to look at my phone. It my cousin was calling. He told us to take our time and he didn't want to talk with my mom. I didn't tell my mother. She looked at me and said why doesn't he want to talk to me. I ignored her question.

My dad called seconds later and told me to tell my mom to pull over. She heard him through the phone and started to cry and yell and question even as we were in the busy traffic. My uncle had died at 8:21 pm. He had accidentally overdosed. It broke all of our hearts. The song ""time in a bottle"" eerily struck a chord for my mother and I and my favorite uncle. My mom instantly said that this song has to have been a message. I have not heard the song randomly since.

The week after everything was said and done, I headed back to maine in my new apartment. I was ready to deal with the death the way any college kid would. I was ready to drink and cry and forget. I went up to my new room and looked around. The first thing I thought of was, I need a drink. The second thing was, at least I was moved in and everything in my room was clean.

I left my room to go to the room across the hall for a second. I came back to find my desk chair sitting and facing my bed. I thought, maybe it was there so I asked my roommates. They said they hadn't been in my room. I looked at the chair again. The way it was position was almost like a parent or elder going to lecture a child in their bed. I took the hint and didn't drink (well as much) that night.

That week a butterfly had shown up in the fire station that my uncle had worked at. It hung around the lockers and the guys living room. It didn't leave until someone said, ""listen geno, your work here is done. It's okay now"". My uncle's childhood friend worked with him and was a fellow firefighter. They went for coffee every morning or took turns. Out of habit, he bought two coffees one morning and brought it to the station. A couple of the guys saw him come in and put the coffees down on the table. And then all of a sudden one of the coffees lifted up and hovered for a second and flew to the floor. It was on a steady surface, there was no wind, and he wasn't directly next to it. No one could explain.

This past month we were moving stuff out of my uncle's house when the keys to the moving truck went missing. We looked everywhere. My dad said they were in his pocket last he knew. The only places my dad had been were on the porch and in the kitchen. We spent an hour looking for them. We looked in the attic closet only to find the keys. My dad had been no where near that!

My aunt and cousin had lived with gene and have both been visited by him in dreams lately and he talks to my cousin and smiles at my aunt. They are the only two in the family that were on rocky terms with gene before he passed away and for him to visit them has given them some peace in his sudden death.

I know this story was long and drawn out but maybe others have similar experiences and could shed some light.

Perverted Ghost,"Texas, United States",Succubus / Incubus / Sexual Ghosts,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Succubus / Incubus / Sexual Ghosts :: Perverted Ghost

M y level of boredom at work today is high. So I have taken to writing down old family ghost stories. My Aunt by marriage grew up in the same neighborhood as my father; growing up in the ""North-side"" of Ft Worth, TX during the 1960's. While she was growing up, her and her family, had a pervert ghost that regularly caused problems in the bathroom of the house.

They took to calling him ""Charlie"" but I don't really know why. My aunt would tell me about how she and her sisters would be taking showers in the bathroom and all of the sudden the shower curtain would open quickly and a cold breeze would invade the shower no matter how hot the water.

My aunt and her sisters were afraid at first but after time they just got annoyed by ""Charlie"". They would yell at him that they were cold and he needed to get out of the bathroom and stop being a pervert! Knowing my aunt several four letter words were probably also yelled. ""Charlie"" would ""apologize"" by closing the shower curtain and warming up the shower.

My aunt and her family never found out who or what ""Charlie"" was but he never hurt anybody and he would stop if you asked him to stop whatever he was doing. My aunt said that she just thought he liked getting an eyeful of teenage girls! Which was probably true, I'm sure ""Charlie"" was upset when my aunt's family moved away!

Stalked in the Forests,"Texas, United States",Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: Stalked in the Forests

E very fifth grader gets the chance to spend a week in Camp Tyler in the middle of a forest. People say that Camp Tyler is haunted, but I didn't believe them. I went to Camp Tyler in the middle of Fall. One day, while everyone else was getting ready to ride the zipline, I sat in a spot several feet away from everyone else. I had chickened out of riding the zipline. I felt as though someone was watching me, so I looked around, but no one was so much as looking at me.

One night in Camp Tyler, we had gone out to watch owls, and we were on our way back to the cabins. We stopped, and one of the camp counselors mimicked the sound of a nocturnal bird that was nearby. I saw a partially transparent white figure standing among the trees, but no one else seemed to notice it.

My best friend Jeremi and I were exploring a forest in his neighborhood. Jeremi stopped to check out some paw prints on the ground, and I heard something jump from a tree branch above me. I looked up, and by the looks of it, whatever had leapt from the branch had been larger than a squirrel because the thick branch was shaking and waving slightly. My breathing became shaky. ""Jeremi let's get back to your house,"" I said, looking at Jeremi. I had begun to feel as though someone was watching me. Jeremi stood up. ""Uh oh,"" he said, looking around, ""I don't know where we are anymore.""

Suddenly, the hair along my spine stood on end. ""Jeremi?"" I said, starting to sweat from fear. Jeremi looked at me. ""Do you feel someone watching you too?"" he asked quietly. I nodded. Jeremi and I glanced over our shoulders, because it felt like they were behind us. We followed a deep dried-up creek bed. The invisible person followed us.

At one point, Jeremi stopped and signaled for me to stop, too. He listened closely to a hole in the left wall of the dried creek bed. I listened, too, and heard rattling. ""The only explanation for that noise is a rattle snake!"" Jeremi exclaimed quietly, jumping back, ""Be careful! There's one here so there are most likely others!"" Jeremi and I continued our journey to find a way out of the forest.

Climbing over tree roots, pushing our way past vines, and watching out for snakes, the invisible person continued to follow us. Every once and a while, we'd hear them step on a leaf behind us. It felt like they were right behind only me instead of both of us. I felt cold, and I was still sweating from fear.

When Jeremi and I found our way out of the forest, we were a long way away from his house. In fact, we were right beside Golden Road. We walked along the curb until we reached a train track, and we turned the corner and followed it. I sensed that the invisible stalker was still there, and my heart sank. ""Who's following us?"" I thought, glancing over my shoulder. No one was there.

Soon, we reached a road and turned, walking along the road. ""We're close... I think. I recognize this neighborhood,"" said Jeremi, leading the way. I still kind of felt the stalker behind us and muttered, ""Good."" It was getting close to sunset. We heard the sound of a leaf getting stepped on behind us. Jeremi and I both jumped and turned in midair, startled. There was no one there. Jeremi and I exchanged glances, turned, and ran for it.

When we stopped to catch our breath, my whole body was shaking. Jeremi started walking again, but I couldn't move. I felt something touch my back and the invisible stalker's cold breath on the side of my neck. A surge of fear flowed through me, and I ran to catch up with Jeremi. Eventually, we found our way to his house with no more incidents.

Several weeks later, I went with Jeremi and his mom to his grandparents' house. We explored the forest there, but then, we eventually got bored. Jeremi sat on a dead, fallen tree and began digging into it, tearing it apart. I stood on a stronger, less-rotten part of the trunk, and we talked for a while.

Then, I felt a sharp, stabbing pain on the back of my neck. Looking up, I saw a dark figure standing in the distance, seeming to stare in our direction. My breath seemed to get caught in my throat, and I glanced at Jeremi to see if he saw the dark figure, but he didn't. He was too busy tearing into the dead tree. When I looked back at where the figure had been, it had vanished.

First Time Experience,Ireland,Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: First Time Experience

I t is popular belief that 13 is an unlucky number, well for me it is 8. 8 years old, just made a real best friend. I'm the winner of almost every squares game (its an irish game, but won't go into the rules. Yet if you're interested ask me and I'll tell you).

Life was great, I wasn't wasting a minute of it and my best friend Stephen had just invited me to stay for two nights in his house. It was actually perfect timing, because my parents were off to see a neil diamond concert in the UK. So off I went to Stephenès house down beside a mental home called the Grange Gorman. This actually scared me. I asked his parents if the patients could escape?, and they said no. Being the inquisitive child I asked, ""how do you know""? Simple answer was because they both worked there. Good enough for me. Little did I realize that my nightmare was already around me.

First night was like any other (except for the fact that I wasn't in my family home), we ate popcorn, talked about computer games (main console at the time was a commodore 64), fought and wrestled each other, and drank way too much cidona and coke for our little bodies to cope with. Stephen headed to the toilet while I held on for dear life and played my game, until I heard footsteps behind me. ""Right my turn!"" I proclaimed while turning around, expecting to see Stephen, but unfortunately no one was there and the steps I heard had stopped. If I knew then that floorboards warped, and the wood creaked because of this I wouldn't have stood where I was, scared as I was.

The bathroom door opened, spilling light into the hallway and the sound of the flushing toilet echoed out also. Stephen emerged and asked if I was ok. I didn't answer. I was still trying to decide if a shadow (I thought I saw) could be darker than a black unlit hallway. I shrugged my shoulders in response to his question and was brought rudely back to reality as pain shot through me and I remembered that nature was calling. Nothing else happened that night.

Second night, almost the same as the first, except we didn't have as much popcorn coke or cidona, but the commodore 64 was in full swing. At about midnight I was peckish, and I asked my best friend if I could get something to eat from the kitchen. Of course it wasn't a problem. I asked Stephen if he wanted anything brought back to him, and he said no. I walked into the hall and down the stairs, treading carefully so as not to wake anyone up. I reached my destination through the darkness and entered. The light from the moon lit up the room in an eerie silver. The black and white tiles which decorated the floor shone, and there, in the centre of the room was my goal, the fridge.

I walked over, my body shivering because the tiles were cold, and opened the fridge door. Immediately I was blinded by the fridge light. My eyes took a few minutes to adjust, and when they finally did, the kitchen door closed itself. I turned, blinded by the light of the fridge, and scared as looked into the darkness. The moonlight also seemed to have vanished. My body felt like it was floating and the back of my neck was starting to feel warm.

Then I heard my name, ""ROB""! It was Stephen. He called again, ""ROB""! But I couldn't answer. I'd lost my voice to fear. I remember crying. My mind was filling up with horrible images. Especially from the night before, the darker than dark shadow. ""ROB""! Stephen again. Gathering courage I took three steps toward the door but stopped because I heard my name again, from behind. My stomach sank. Tears blurred my vision and my heart was pounding (after this night I knew what fear was) ""Rob""! Barely a whisper, but not from a voice I knew. ""Hey Rob""! It mocked. I wanted to run but couldn't.

Then everything felt like it was over, my life, my dreams, everything, because a cold hand reached out and gripped my shoulder, tightly. Once again the man spoke this time in my ear, then slowly his face came around from my shoulder and went directly in front of mine, and smiled at me. Then it was over. Just like that. But, I remembered never taking my eyes off of the door, even when I saw through the ghost. I know that that's what gets me the most. The fact of seeing through someone. I left that night and stayed with my grandparents who only lived four minutes walk from my home in cabra.

I have told this story to certain people, who have had experiences. And every time I tell it, it makes it easier to cope with. So please read and re read. There is a second part of this which happened a decade later, and in that story I'll describe the stranger from this one (I've seen him three times) but they are other stories.

My only question is has anyone else seen the same ghost more than once? And is this, regular?

By the way I must say something else, Stephens' family had to move out of that home because of this ghost. They too had experiences, names being called and so on. They moved across the road where they now happily live, but that house is still there, empty. No one moves in.

The Ouija Board,"California, United States",Ouija Board / Seances,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Ouija Board / Seances :: The Ouija Board

I always wanted to use the ouija board. Because I felt that maybe it might actually work since I've always felt connected with spirits, also because of how spooky it was to find it. My friends mom and dad found the ouija board buried about 4 feet under a house they were remolding.

Me and my friend tried it every time I spent the night at her house. Just hoping that one time it would work. We'd light up candles. And all this other spiritual stuff. But it never did... Until one night.

It was my birthday and a couple of my closets friends were staying the night. I had alix bring it over. Because I thought that maybe it would work better with more people.

It was late at night. And we all stuck 2 fingers on the pointer. It was me 3 of my friends my sister and my brother. I was the speaker or whatever you call it. So I was asking all the questions. I asked it if anybody would like to talk to us. After trying for so long that night it moved. It went to yes. Not to fast. We were all so amazed. We never actually thought it was going to work. I knew none of us could be moving it. All our fingers were on so lightly. And just the way it moved didn't seem to be us.

I asked it a lot of questions and it answered them. I can't remember them all though. Then I asked if I knew it. It said yes. My brother died in 2001. So I thought it might be him. I asked if it was kenny. It went straight to yes. And my siblings burst into tears. We told it we loved him and missed him. And asked how heaven was and stuff.

Then I ran to my dad because I was excited to tell him that we were talking to kenny. He's never believed in spirits or ghost or anything of that. I just wanted to prove to him it was true. He said we were moving it. So I told my dad to ask a question that none of us would know the answer to so that we couldn't answer it. And he asked what was the name of the guy who you brought home to beat me up. It took a while and then it moved to a couple of letters and spelled out a name. My dad said it was wrong.

We knew we weren't moving it so it couldn't be us. And then I realized we weren't talking to my brother. I don't know if we ever were. I felt betrayed. And I thought that whatever we were talking to was evil. For even saying it was my brother.

Then I said this isn't kenny is it. And it went straight to no. That scared us. We asked if it knew any of us and it said yes. We asked who? And it said ashley. And ashley asked if it was her grandpa. And it went to yes really quick. We asked it how many kids her grandpa had and we didn't say the answer out loud because we figured it was only saying the things we said that's how it answered all the ones about kenny. And it said the wrong number.

I said this isn't her grandpa is it? And it went to no. And I felt a cold chill. And we stopped playing with it at that point.

I think who or whatever we were talking to that night is still in my house. The lights flicker. And doors open and close. And my room is the worst of all. Its always so cold. And I have horrible nightmares in there now. And lights NEVER work in there. They always break right away. We even had a guy come over and try to fix my ceiling light. And right after he did it broke again.

I feel a presence in my house. It scares me at times. Feels like I'm being watched. I don't know what it is. But it freaks me out.

Unfriendly Follower,Australia,A Haunted Life,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: A Haunted Life :: Unfriendly Follower

F irst of all I'd like to start by saying, I don't believe in ghosts. I live in a small mining town called blackwater. My friends and I are considered to be outcasts due to the way we dress and the genre of music we listen to. Most people call us goths or emo.

One friday, after school we decided to go to the memorial to speak with ""ghosts"" as a joke. When we arrived it was just after sunset. We sat, speaking to our deceased friends. Nothing happened, I did not experience any strange or unknown presence. This did not come as a surprise to me. My closest friend justin, received a call from his brother telling him he was supposed to be home now. We all headed to his place as that is where we were staying for the night. As we left, I laughed. Justin said ""you can come stay at my house, I don't want to be lonely"" as a joke to the ""ghost"". We all laughed, knowing nothing was going to happen.

When we got to his house, his mother was angry that we had arrived home so late. As a punishment for this, she sent us all home except for me, I was very close to his family and I was never punished for anything.

Later that night after we had enjoyed our dinner we decided to play halo against each other using system link (that way we could play in separate rooms to prevent screen peaking). I went into the guest room. This is when strange things began to happen. The tv I was using turned off and I couldn't turn it back on. I went into justin's room to tell him, he said that he will use the guest room. When he turned the tv on, he had no trouble with it. I didn't take any notice of it and spent hours playing halo with him.

When we got bored, both of us sat on his balcony. I had as glass of coke placed near the center of a table. While I was talking to justin he told me to move my glass away from the edge of the table. When I looked I notice that the glass was close to falling off the table. I then moved it closer to the middle and continued to talk. Our conversation was interrupted by a loud smash. Justin went inside and come back out with a dustpan and brush, he looked at me and said I told you to move your glass. I explained to him that I did but he replied ""you don't have to lie it's okay, it's just a glass man"". I just smiled and said okay man.

Then I was beginning to feel tired. I laid on the couch and dozed off watching rage. While I was asleep I had a dream that made me feel uneasy. In my dream I could see nothing, I could hear a firm voice telling me to leave. This voice reminded me of an angry father getting angry with his child.

When I woke up justin's brother was standing over me. When I asked him what was wrong he said, ""while I was sleeping, I heard someone telling me to leave, I woke up and could still hear it, so I came to see if it was you"". Me being ignorant, said it must have been, I laughed and said I always talk in my sleep.

After that night, strange things would happen whenever I would go to justin's house. Recently, I told him what had happened and that I was feeling uncomfortable, he said ""oh yeah that ghost is my best buddy, I told him to do this stuff"" I just laughed. Then he said ""ghost, go home with petty I don't want you anymore"".(petty is what my friends call me because I'm short). I just laughed.

That was about four days ago and I have been having random nightmares every time I fall asleep. I wake up with the urge to vomit. I have been to the doctors and have been told there is nothing wrong with me. Now my entire family thinks I'm vomiting on purpose to keep my weight down. I don't know what to do and I'm starting to freak out. And it's kind of hard to tell people a ghost is giving me trouble. What should I do?

How It All Started,Norway,Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: How It All Started

W hen I was around 3-5 years old, I moved too this new house on the country side. I was really young and looking for fun all the time, and lucky for me the neighbor boy next door was at the same age as me (I'm just going to call him Mike) and had the same interests as me at that time.

One day Mike started to talk about this house on one of the fields that was close to the forest. He said that it was really old and possibly ghosts lived there. At this time, I had no clue what a ghost was so I was curious and tagged along. When we had sneaked through the cow fence and the houses, we arrived close enough to the house so that I could start too see what's inside the windows by detail. It was really old, it was grey with a fainted red color on it and some broken windows and a lot of webs in the windows.

As I looked on one of the 2nd floor windows, I noticed a woman looking out at us. She was really pale and had curly hair and a white dress, and she looked like she was hiding behind one of the curtains.

I quickly asked him ""Are you sure no one lives there?"" he responded quickly ""Psst! Of course, who would live like that?"" I didn't respond and looked up again towards where I had seen the woman, and she was gone.

When we reached the house we only looked inside the windows as the old furniture and chairs that had been placed on the tables.

We went on the backside and he ran over the window with a big open crack, and he put his arm in trying to reach something. ""What are you doing?"" I asked him, ""There's a hat there, I want it!"" I just hurried over and peeked inside. It was a bowler hat; it was dirty and didn't look any pleasant to wear on your head.

He didn't get it out of the crack, since it was too small and got really angry and I just said ""Let's just look on the other side of the house then, maybe we can reach something there?"" so we ran around and I noticed this plank on the wall that was loose.

I quickly pushed it and it cracked, I just threw it on the ground and noticed the gray ash inside the wall, I just called for him and he ran over and saw the pile of ash. ""What's this?"" he responded and started to take his hands into it, like if he was digging after something.

He managed to get something and he pulled it out, and it was a bone. I freaked out and just stood there looking at the bone, it didn't look like an animal bone since it was as long as half of my arm and he just smiled and looked at it. ""Aren't you scared?"" I asked him, ""No, should I? This is cool I've always wanted a bone."" I quickly snatched it from his hands and placed it into the pile of dust and I heard the neighbor dogs started to bark towards us.

""Oh my god! We have to get out of here before they spot us!"" (The owner of the old house lives close enough to see if a person is in front of the house) he said and started to run home, and I just ran after him.

Some days later I started to wake up at night, I didn't know why but I did it almost every night. And every time I heard someone walk in the hallway outside my room, so I always hid under the blanket until I fell asleep again.

Not long after this I decided to go out in the hallway to see if it was one of the cats walking around, but when I came out there no cats was to be found, and I quickly looked up the stairs and saw the lights were on and I some a shadow of a person walking by. I hurried up in hope to see if it was my mother being up at night again, but the living room was all dark and I just freaked out and ran into my parent's bedroom and I woke up my parents and told them what I just saw. And as normally parents say, they said I was dreaming. So I went downstairs and just went back to sleep.

Ok this was just some of the things happening, I've had many more then these experiences with the thing called ""ghosts/spirits"", but I will try to get them up later.

I also still live in the house, and I'm not the only one that have had things happening around the house.

Haunted Houses and Vivid Dreams,United Kingdom,Misc,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Misc :: Haunted Houses and Vivid Dreams

F ollowing up from my first story about the house I live in that was built in 1860 that has 3 ghosts, I want to talk about other strange things that happen in the house that I believe may have something to do with the house or more so, what's in it. 3 of us live in separate flats within the house and we've all admitted that since we got settled in there we've all had weird dreams, some scary, some funny, some eccentric too.

They are all really vivid, the ones I have are mainly silly or eccentric and we normally have a laugh about them the next morning when we get up and talk about it but my boyfriend gets really bad dreams and often sleepwalks.

There has been an occasion where he has got up in the night, left his flat, gone down the stairs and hidden his wallet in the cardboard recycling bag, we spent the whole of the next day looking for it.

Another time he dreamt that the wall out the front of the house had been stolen, when he woke up he said to me ""I hope they catch the little gits who took it"", I said ""What?"", he told me the wall had been taken, he was really freaked out when he looked out and saw it was still there.

The worst one was recently when we were sleeping apart because I was ill, at about 2am I got a call from a withheld number on my mobile so I rang my boyfriend as I gathered it could only be him at that time of night, when he answered it was clear I had woken him (OOPS), I told him a was really uneasy sleeping as there were strange noises keeping me up and I asked if I could go up and get in his bed with him, he said no and told me he'd had some bad news that night, he told me how he'd had a call from his best friends girlfriend who was very upset and telling him that his friend had passed away from a heart attack 4 days earlier, he even told me when the funeral was going to be and that they were going to do an autopsy. I gave my condolences and went back to bed.

The next day I was going through my recent calls and there were 2 numbers with no names, one was my friends and the other was my boyfriends friends number (he'd been trying to call him on new years eve as he was worried) but I didn't know which was which, so I rang one at random, when he answered I asked if it was Andrew and he went ""No, Colin"" (My boyfriends ""dead"" friend).

I told my boyfriend later who I'd spoken to and he was gobsmacked, he really thought his friend was dead. He'd dreamt his friend had passed and even discussed it with his friends partner, on the land line. He could have told everyone about his death when all along he had just had a vivid dream.

We're always having these dreams, some are OTT, what do you guys think? It's never been like this until we moved into that old house.

Gettysburg Ghost,"Pennsylvania, United States",Ghost Tours & Haunted Hotels,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Ghost Tours & Haunted Hotels :: Gettysburg Ghost

I n 2003 I had retired (after a mere three years) from public school teaching in Brooklyn, New York. I was 26 years old and had no real idea what yet to do with my life in terms of a career. Instead of going to law school like everyone else, I decided I would do something a little less ordinary and a little more exciting than forging a career. I decided out of the blue really, that I would go home to Ohio for awhile. This idea quickly blossomed into a trek of sorts as the plan became to bicycle from my apartment in Brooklyn to my parents' house in Columbus, Ohio. No problem. All I had to do was procure a bicycle and go west until things began to look familiar...

Long story short: I bought a bike and saddle bags, loaded up my gear, trained for a week and then headed west into New Jersey in early October. I averaged about 60 miles or so a day depending on the terrain and quickly realized I had bitten off more than I could chew. I rolled into town one evening after having chewed through 80 miles of western Pennsylvanian countryside so dehydrated I felt as though I was severely hung over. I couldn't even eat. I sat in my hotel room and drank gatorade for hours. I realized it was a long trip and I would need to take things easier if I was going to make the 400+ miles back to the Ohio River Valley. I decided to break-up my trip with days of rest.

Sometime at the end of my first week on the road, a Friday, I glided into Gettysburg, Pennsylvania, the site of the epic battle of the same name that would turn the tide of the Civil War in favor of the Union. I thought this would be a good place to hold up for a few days and rest while seeing the sites. It was early in the afternoon and I had called friends the previous day asking them to meet me in Gettysburg for the weekend. They complied and we split a hotel room. We had a nice time playing around the battlefield and just hanging out that night and the following Saturday. At the end of the next day, my friends drove back to New York City and I got a new motel room up the road about 3 miles from the town.

That night, since I was again on my own, I decided to go on one of the many ""ghost tours"" Gettysburg has to offer. Mine visited different ""haunted"" sites around the town and battlefield and ended at the Farnsworth Inn--one of the reportedly most haunted hotels in America. The tour went down into the basement where the tour guide related the history of the inn.

The Farnsworth Inn served as a hospital (as did nearly every building in town, evidently) in July, 1863. My tour group consisted of about 10 people--a family of 3, a few couples, and myself, the single guy carrying around a bike helmet and lock. The basement was about 20 feet wide by 30 feet long laid out with a small stage in front where the tour guide stood and spoke, telling a few more ghost stories about the inn itself. There was a series of folding chairs set-up in about ten rows of 20 chairs each with an aisle in the middle. Almost everyone sat in or near the first 4 rows. I selected the first chair from the aisle in about the 6th row or so and prepared to listen to the tour guide tell us about deceased soldiers who supposedly still haunted the hotel.

Before she began the stories, however, she had a disclaimer for us. She told us not to be alarmed if anyone felt a touch or a presence while in the basement and to please not jump up and scream and/or run out of the basement because, not only did it alarm others, but it is an old place with cramped doorways and steep stairs and people have hurt themselves trying to flee in the past. Made sense to me. No sooner had the words passed her lips than I felt someone's hand come down to rest on my left shoulder between my shoulder and my neck--right on my left-most part of my trapezius muscle and give me a gentle, but certainly deliberate, squeeze. My first thought was simply, somebody wants me to move so they can see the stage. As soon as I felt this pressure on my shoulder, I said, ""Oh, excuse me..."" and shifted to the right to provide a view while turning around to smile and say sorry. But as my head rotated back over my left shoulder, I could clearly see that, not only was there nobody sitting in the seat behind me, but that there was not one person in the back of the room at all. I was the the last person in the seats and everyone else in the room was seated in front of me. I did not scream, I did not even bother to tell the tour guide what had occurred as I was sure she experiences that kind of thing all the time.

However, when the tour was over, I had to get back on my bike and pedal 3 miles through the dark countryside back to my motel. Suffice to say, I was scared the whole time I would see a detachment of phantom soldiers on patrol or something. My legs were burning upon screeching into the driveway of my motel. It took me an hour to calm down and stop sweating. Man, it is DARK in the countryside at night, and I still had about 300 miles of it left to go...

The Antique Store Basement,"Illinois, United States",Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: The Antique Store Basement

I know that it is difficult to believe a ghost story that you haven't experienced yourself but I can only relate my experience to the best of my abilities; it was so intense that I feel compelled to share it.

I have in the past had some experiences with the paranormal but never one quite as scary as my experience in the antique store basement located in small northern Illinois town. It was a nice summer day and I was looking at the antiques with my mom in a store that I later found was once a hardware store. We both went down the stairs to the basement. As I was walking I felt extremely dizzy and could not avoid the strange idea of my head smashing into the pavement I was walking on. We were making our way to the back of the basement and my eyes were drawn to the corners of the ceiling, as if I was watching something move back and forth between them. I had another odd thought of a tiger pacing back and forth, its shoulder blades moving swiftly above its stooped head. I was ignoring these thoughts as we got to the end of the room. I suddenly heard a man's deep voice slowly work up to a savage scream, ""Get out, get OUT, GET OUT!, GET OUUUUUT!, GET OOOUUUUUUT!"" It sounded like a man going insane with anger and grief. It was a voice that is best described as tormented.

The hairs stood up on the back of my neck and chills ran up and down my back. I noticed then that there was NO ONE but us in the basement and turned to my mom to quietly suggest that we leave. Before I heard a response I turned to see my mother literally running away through the basement and up the stairs! I could not stop myself from yelling, ""Wait for me! Don't leave me alone! Wait! Wait!"".

Needless to say we walked straight out of the store and started a long and silent trip home. Weirdly enough we didn't talk about why we ran away like lunatics and the moment was nearly forgotten. Until two weeks later when I finally had to bring it up to her. Neither of us are very comfortable with it but my late grandmother, mother, and myself seem to have somewhat psychic abilities. As I said earlier, I have experienced a few things before with and without my mother so it was odd for me to not bring it up earlier. Without telling her any details I asked her if she happened to hear anybody yelling that day. She stopped what she was doing and answered yes. I asked her to repeat what she heard and it was exactly what I had heard that day! Even the crazed tone and rising anger with each ""get out"" was precisely as I had heard it!

She still refuses to say any more about that day and I'm left to wonder alone what I had experienced and why. I was so curious that I tried to look up the history of the town, which was very sparse. I did find that a man named George had shot himself in the head around the time that the store was in use but I couldn't confirm anything for sure. I continue to have paranormal experiences but nothing comes close to the surprise and terror I had experienced that day.

I had just come home from school, and I was walking up my stairs to my apartment. In my uncle's window, you can see his living room. As I was walking up and I had happened to look in those windows. My cousins are young and have this rocking horse. It was rocking back and forth. I sat there and watched as it kept moving... Then it stopped.

After a few minutes of wondering what I just saw, I heard and saw their bedroom door slam shut. And that is just one of the little stories I have. This house is very odd. Where I live there is no living room. Just a hallway,bathroom, kitchen, and mine and my dads rooms. But in that one hallway, there are 8 doors. I can't explain it but through out the whole house there are 25 doors (4 bedrooms, 2 bathrooms, 5 walk in closets). I don't get it. I think it's a portal or something. There is such an eerie feeling to the whole house.

One day my niece was sitting on my bed (she is 2 years old), I was sitting right next to her as she said ""do you see the man?"" I was totally amazed at what she had said. That very same day, she was sitting in the hallway playing with her toy horses and looked up at the ceiling and said ""will you please go away?"" she started to cry and my door slammed shut. I will never know what went on that day, but to this day she will not play or be alone in my room.

Followed by a Dark Figure,Canada,Psychic / Medium,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Psychic / Medium :: Followed by a Dark Figure

T here is a fair amount of psychic ability that seems to run through the women of my family. Ever since I was a child I would have small bursts of psychic experiences like deja vu, dreams that would come true and just knowing things before they happened. However when I hit puberty this all changed.

I started to feel as though I were being watched, it was a thick panicking feeling that I would be overwhelmed with suddenly. I mentioned my experiences and feelings to my mother and she would always tell me to ""pray it away"". My mother has many experiences of her own but does not see her ability as a gift and prays to God to take it away. I tried this and it seemed to help for a while, then one day it got much, much worse.

One day, in the middle of the afternoon, I was home alone. I walked into the living room and I was stopped in my tracks. The living room was empty, but looming in my mind was this tall black figure standing in front of the couch. The only way I can properly explain it would be to say that he was invisible to the naked eye but I could see him with my mind.

Ever since that day he's always been near. I can see him with my mind if he's in the house, but when he's not I can tell how far away he is by the ""thick"" or ""heavy"" feeling he gives me. The closer he is the thicker or heavier the feeling is, and if he's in the house I see him. I have gotten somewhat used to his shocking appearance but he frightened me so much at first. He is very, very tall and sickly thin. He's all black and has very long fingers, they almost look like claws. His arms are long too, everything about him is long... Arms, legs, face, fingers everything. He doesn't have regular feet either... His feet are hooked and he stands on his toes. He looks as though if I were to touch him he would feel like sand, very rough.

I think what scares me the most about him is that I don't know what he wants. Whenever I see him he is just standing there, I never actually see him walking or moving, and he never talks. I can't see any facial features either so I can't even begin to tell what he is feeling. I get the feeling that he wants something from me though... In times of pain, sickness, or stress he gets closer to me. When I'm stronger I can keep him out of the house, but when I'm sick, hurt or tired he's right there in the room with me. I still have other more mild psychic experiences like deja vu. I have that a lot actually. But I don't understand what this means. I'm afraid.

I Saw my First Ghost,"Rhode Island, United States",Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: I Saw my First Ghost

I submitted a story not too long ago about my grandma on my dad's side and her supposedly haunted house . This story is about my grandma on my mom's side of the family, and no doubt, her house is definitely haunted!

When my mom was younger, she moved from Portugal to the US, into Rhode Island and settled into the house which my grandma still lives in. My mom tells me the house was always weird and she'd always hear things.

At night, she would be in her bedroom on the second floor and hear someone walking up the stairs. But nobody ever emerged onto the second floor, all she heard were footsteps. In the basement, when you put your ear to the wall, you could hear someone heavily breathing through the concrete.

I always knew the house was a bit off and sort of creepy, but until the past summer, I now know someone definitely haunts the house, and I had the experience of seeing my first ghost.

Me and my younger sister Victoria decided to sleep over my grandma's house one day over the summer. School was starting in a few weeks so I think it was towards the end of August when this happened. We slept fine through the night but I opted to keep the television on while we fell asleep because we were both nervous about sleeping with the lights off in her house.

The next morning we ate breakfast, watched some tv, and I decided to go upstairs and gather my things because my grandma had to go to work in an hour so we were leaving soon. I grabbed my backpack and set it on the bed. I was looking down at the bed as I put my stuff inside it, but I could see the doorway out of the corner of my eye.

This is one of the creepiest things that I've ever experienced. As I was glancing down at my bad, I saw a very pale woman with white hair in a white nightgown stagger by the doorway. Then I heard the light switch in the other room being flicked up and down for about 10 seconds. Then it stopped and I waited for someone to emerge from the room. I thought maybe it was my grandma or sister. This still gives me the chills when I think about it; I stepped into the other room and looked around and NOBODY WAS THERE. I looked around all on the second floor (it's not that big-- a bathroom, 2 bedrooms, and a small living room with the door to the attic). Nobody was there at all, it was just me! I got freaked out as I clumsily stuffed the rest of my stuff in my bag and ran downstairs. I didn't go back up there that day.

I told my mom about it after and she translated it to my grandma (she's Portuguese and not too good with English, nor can I speak Portuguese). She got creeped out. My mom told me that when her great-grandma was still living and quite often fell down the stairs (she lived with them), that often it felt as though someone pushed her hard.

A few months ago I was in the backyard and out of the corner of my eye I saw a little girl in a blue dress run by and go behind the bushes. When I looked, nobody was there. My cousins and siblings were there, but none of them wore a blue dress.

I'd really like to see the history of this house, but I don't know how I do that.

Ghost in my Ancestral House,Philippines,Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: Ghost in my Ancestral House

O ur ancestral house is located in Malolos, Bulacan. It is the seat of the first congress of the Philippine Revolutionary Government of Gen. Aguinaldo during the revolution against the Spanish Government. And our ancestral house is obviously one of the oldest in our city. Currently, the city government has proclaimed that our house is one of the last surviving old house that has retained its original structure in our municipality.

Let me tell you one of my ghostly experience in this house. When I was 12yrs old, my family came to visit my grandmothers house during summer. One summer day, my father is tending the garden, my mom is with my aunt and with yaya doing the laundry under the stairs of our azotea (balcony). My two sibling were already playing at the garden. I over slept and woke up late that day at about 9:45am.

I proceeded to the long table where there are some breakfast left overs. So I grab a chair and started eating tocilog (fried garlic rice, sunny-side eggs and a tocino). While I was eating, somebody just passed by at my back. She walks so slow and without a noise just like my aunt. The vision in my peripherals shows a white blurry female figure and she just passed by behind me. Thinking it was my aunt, I asked to be served vinegar ""auntie can you give me some vinegar, please?"". She didn't answered so I glanced to where she came from until I am facing the direction of the big sala (living room).

To my surprise, nobody was there and I am virtually alone. I felt chilly air at that moment and strands of hair at the back of my neck all stood up. I remember that I left the table, run towards the balcony and went downstairs stepping 2 or 3 steps at a time and shouting ""may multo! May multo!""(there's a ghost! There's a ghost!). And there I saw my aunt doing laundry with my mom and yaya.

It was comical and yet spooky. That is my first encounter with the ghost who is residing in our ancestral house. It is believed that that is the ghost of an old woman that has been adopted by my grandparents. She is said to have no known relatives so my grandparents took her and made her yaya for my father, my uncle and my aunt when they were still small. My father told me that she died in our house in her quarters because of old age.

Knock! Knock! Whos's There?,Philippines,Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: Knock! Knock! Whos's There?

T his is an another incident at the ancestral house . It is Christmas vacation and the old house is lively again with laughter and noises. It was Christmas holiday of 1986 and my family of four, my father, mom, my brother and sister and myself just arrived 3:30pm. In the old house. My uncle with his wife and three children arrived at 4pm.

My whole family are all inside the master bedroom watching tv while my uncle's family were in the other room fixing their things. The yaya at that time was in the kitchen preparing some dinner for all of us. While still watching tv programs we heard 3 knocks and my mom quickly answered, ""who is it? Come in"". Nobody answered so we just brushed it off and continued watching tv.

The next moment we heard three knock again. My mom asked who it was but nobody was answering. So my father told my mom maybe it was yaya who was just shy to answer. So my mom went outside but nobody was in front of the door. She opened the door so wide so all of us saw that nobody was outside. My mom went to the other room to ask if they were the ones who was knocking, but they said that they were busy unpacking their things. So she went to the kitchen and asked our yaya if she happens to be out in our room and was the one knocking our door. Our yaya was confused and said that she never went to our room to knock because she was busy preparing our dinner.

Who could that be? Our door is a solid wood made of kamagong. It needs some force so that your knock could be heard inside the room. If nobody from us knocked at our door at that time, then who could it be? Then my father said that it could be the ghost of the old lady who died there a long time ago so all of us offered a prayer for her.

The House on Cambridge 3,"Ohio, United States",Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: The House on Cambridge 3

T his is yet another installment in what has become The Cambridge Series of ghost recollections. In truth, so many distinct things occurred in our house, it all becomes rather hazy in terms of sequence in time, however, this happened around 1992 when my littlest sister was going into kindergarten.

Just to recap: my parents bought a late 19th century Victorian home in Columbus, Ohio in the early 1990s. They moved in with me and my two brothers and two sisters and seemingly supernatural things began happening to my one brother and both parents almost immediately.

However, eventually, all but one member of the family would be affected. This vignette is about my youngest sister, who shall be referred to as ""O...""

When we moved into our house, O was about 4 or 5 years old. Unlike most young kids, she loved to sleep and would often not rise until after 10 AM or so. One morning, after having lived in the house for about a year or so, my mother heard O calling for help from her bedroom. My mother went to check and see what was the matter. As she began to open the door, she felt resistance from the other side. It was O on the other side struggling with something. After a bit of jostling, my mom opened the door to see O standing in front of it balancing a large framed picture, partly sitting on the ground. It was the picture from above her bed. This picture is a painting framed in an old, heavy, oak frame with nice glass. It is about 3 feet by 2 feet and must weigh about 30 pounds--much too large and heavy for a kindergardener to move on her own. My mother asked her what she was doing with it on the ground and how she got it off the wall in the first place. O replied that when she awoke, it was leaning against her door. O's door opens INto her room, so anyone who would have taken it off the wall would not have been able to easily lean it against the door as they exited that same doorway. Not only that, but it would have been difficult to manage taking the picture off the wall without waking the child sleeping beneath it. Confused, but knowing what was probably going on and not wanting to scare O, Mom simply placed it back on the wall and that was that.

Or so she thought. The very next morning, O awoke again, only to find the same picture missing from the wall above her bed. As she went to open her door, she felt a pressure on the other side. Peeking around the ajar door, she saw the picture leaning against the outside of her own door. Again, she called for Mom to help her move the picture and exit her room. Again, Mom knew this was yet another supernatural action and wanted to feign non chalance in order to spare her youngest child undue fear. Our mother placed the picture back on the wall above O's bed for the second time in as many days.

Of course, you all know what happened on the third morning. O awoke, late again, and opened her door. She left her room and began walking down the hallway to the stairs to the kitchen, to where everyone in the family regularly gravitated. O slowly padded down the back staircase into the kitchen, her blanket trailing behind her like a sleepy snake. She said to my mother, ""Mom, my picture is gone again..."" Alarmed, Mom went upstairs to investigate. There, about 15 feet down the hall, she found the picture, this time leaning against the banister of the stairs. At this point, she was expecting it and again brushed it off. It's not easy to fool a child, but the gears in their minds switch rapidly and are usually easily distracted. To this day, O had no recollection of this encounter.

Acceptance of Paranormal Activity,"Massachusetts, United States",Psychic / Medium,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Psychic / Medium :: Acceptance of Paranormal Activity

I will never in my life forget the night that I first laid eyes on the ghost that inhabits my bedroom. I had just moved my bedroom from the third floor of our house down to the basement because my older brother moved into his own place and the basement boasted more room for myself and a lot more privacy.

I was soundly sleeping and anyone would tell you, I sleep like a rock and it takes A LOT to wake me up. Suddenly my eyes shot open. I wasn't at all groggy or ""out of it"" as people usually are when they suddenly awaken in the middle of the night. I was very awake and very aware. The first thing I saw were the bright red lights of my alarm clock that read 3:15am. I peered over slowly across my room and that's when I saw it. She was standing at the foot of my bed. An older woman, short and on the heavy side. She was wearing a shall and holding it over her shoulders, her hair was pulled back neatly in a tight bun. She looked like the ""old italian grandmother"" type. She had the most serious look to her face, not mean or angry-just serious. Her entire figure was a grey/white color but I could distinctly make out her facial features and I will never in my life forget her face.

I was so shocked that I couldn't move. I literally could not convey any emotion whether it be horror, happiness, or sadness. It was as if I was frozen with shock and even stranger, I didn't feel scared. After probably 15-20 seconds of complete eye contact I was able to slam my eyelids shut and when I reopened my eyes she was gone. Somehow I managed to fall back asleep that night and I soon understood that the ghost wasn't a dark spirit because she never made me feel scared.

Since this experience, I've had many, many other strange things happen in my bedroom, but I have never seen the ghost again. Pictures will fall of the wall in the middle of the night, candles or odd objects will literally be flung across my bedroom, the door will slowly creak open and hit the wall with a thud at random times, jewelry will disappear and never be seen again (my girlfriends pair of gold earrings completely vanished, along with a few of my earrings and chains).

It's come to the point where I accept that I share my bedroom with a ghost. If she's screwing with me I simply say out loud ""Cut it out!"" or ""Stop it"", ""Go away"" and it usually works. I think of myself as having the gift of experiencing paranormal activity and as I've gotten older I've learned to accept it, to even cherish it because it's not an ability many people have. I know the instance I enter a new place whether spirits or energies are present.

One night me and my girlfriend were at my sister's house babysitting my niece when we suddenly BOTH heard the faint but clear as crystal whispers of children coming from the baby monitor (at the time my niece was only a couple months old and hadn't even started baby babbling). I ran up the stairs to my niece's bedroom thinking someone had broken into the house, only to find her soundly sleeping and the room to be deathly silent.

I'm convinced that someone was drowned in the 2nd floor bath tub of my home. When I was younger I used to love taking baths, but became completely horrified and envisioned a strangers hands holding me underwater whenever I would dunk my head under to rinse out shampoo. I think that spirits are attracted to me because my list of paranormal experiences can go on and on.

My mother told me she used to see the ghost of a woman walking back and forth from the bathroom (the visions of someone being drowned) and my bedroom when my bedroom was upstairs. One night as I was driving home from a friends house all alone, I peered over into the passenger seat and saw the faint figure of a little girl sitting right next to me. I slammed the car to a stop and had to get out and recollect myself afterwards.

Just last night I was at a friends house (where he also experiences paranormal activity regularly) and just sitting there, watching television, I said to myself ""I've never had any weird experiences here, I wonder why?"" and at that exact moment there was a loud bang on my friends bedroom door to where everyone in the room jumped in horror because nobody else was in the house.

As I said before, I've come to the point that where I accept the fact that the paranormal is attracted to me. I truly believe it's a gift rather than a burden. I've yet to experience any negative energy or had any negative paranormal experiences so that might change (lol) but for now I accept it and I think it's pretty cool.

My Ghosts,"Texas, United States",A Haunted Life,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: A Haunted Life :: My Ghosts

T his is my first time submitting a story, but definitely not my first paranormal experience. This actually occurred to my next door neighbor (I like to call her V8, it's a long story) as well as me. But since it's my computer, I get to tell the story.

V8 and I were sitting in my front yard and laughing at each other while snapping pictures with my new camera. It was really fun until we headed over to the old playground set that my brother and I had installed when I was littler. V8 started freezing up and looking over there until she finally told me she kept seeing this guy walking past the swing set. I asked her about it, and the more she said the more freaked out I got.

This isn't my first experience by far, but it's the first that I've had with someone else. And the person she was describing exactly described one of the people I'd seen flitting about my backyard before. He also perfectly described a person we'd thought we had made up. His name is Seth, he is 16, has long emo black hair and wears a gray hoodie and black jeans. He only appears in flashes, you can never see him long but I get the feeling he's letting us see him way more than normal. Because before he only appeared out of the corner of my eyes, and now I can see him for intervals that last seconds.

He has some certain patterns he always follows. He's always either sitting down, or walking from right to left. He never walks towards you, or from left to right, and one time while I was standing in my front yard I felt him tap my shoulder and no one was there. Seth also has a certain feeling that comes with him, it's this peaceful feeling. Whenever he's around, you feel totally at ease, no matter what. It feels like your heart is full... I don't know how to describe it better.

But we took a picture of my old playground equipment and at first saw nothing odd... Only at further inspection did V8 and I realize that there was a human's shadow going in the complete opposite direction than the other shadows were going right where Seth had been standing. And under further inspection we found the name ""Seth"" spelled out in the leaves and sticks in the background of the picture.

But Seth, as I said, is calming. You know he's not out to kill you, and you can really tell when he's around. Plus it only happens when it's sunny, Seth is just a sunny person I guess. One time I lost my camera battery and Seth found it for us, I asked for his help and there it was. Sitting somewhere I'd already looked a few seconds earlier. Seth is actually a nice guy, once you get to know him. He's only gotten mad at me once (which was a mess-up on my part).

I can't say the same for the most recent addition to the ghosts V8 and I have been seeing (there are 4, one from a LONG time ago that left and one that just came today). She's not actually doing anything... But... When I said Seth gives you a calming feeling when he's around; then for her it's the opposite. You all of a sudden feel paranoid, on edge, almost terrified; and then she shows up. I know I'm not imagining things because when she showed up at school today V8 noticed also.

Plus another girl in my class commented on the feeling she was getting. People might not notice Seth, but whoever this girl is, she gets noticed. The room started suddenly smelling weird, it made you dizzy, you get cold, you start getting a headache, and then you get that paranoid feeling. It didn't help when I saw her twice last night. She showed up in the mirror and when I turned around she wasn't there, I couldn't sleep. Then I heard this odd noise that I couldn't place (it was a bike. V8 told me a story about her siblings and her when she was littler seeing a bike with no one riding it and when she described the noise it made, it fit. I might also add that I only knew one ghost before V8 moved onto my street. And I was unaware he was even a ghost. I thought I had an overactive imagination), I lay in bed freaking out then I saw her flit through the hallway. Unlike Seth she has platinum (almost white) hair that's average/long length, and wears a white dress... I don't know if she was murdered and that's how she died or what, I want to get to know her, but she always leaves when I start actually acknowledging her.

Unlike some of the stories here, this didn't go away suddenly, there isn't a solution yet. As I said, all these ghosts have never actually done anything to harm me. The only instance I can remember was once something pushed V8 into the pool. And I was almost strangled while lying alone in bed once... I don't know what happened either of these times, but it's not the same feeling... I don't know what to think.

Second Encounter with the Same Entity,Ireland,A Haunted Life,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: A Haunted Life :: Second Encounter with the Same Entity

A s most of you have read already, I had my first encounter with a spirit (of malice as far as I'm concerned) when I was 8. Also I said that he appeared to me twice more. This story is the second time. A decade from my first experience I worked in a petrol station on the north circular road. My shift was the graveyard shift (I always liked were they got that expression from, same with saved by the bell).

I'd peel barcodes from expired newspapers, re-stock the shelves and then serve a handful of customers. But I mostly sat down reading a good book, listening to music and have a smoke (I've now quit). It wasn't too difficult a job. So, one night I'm sitting down at the window were I'd serve customers, book in hand (terry brooks' sword of shannara, my fave) which I'd read already but was re-reading, feet up on the until in front. Totally chilling out. What I was missing was one of my cigarettes. Picking up my box of smokes from the until shelf I realized I had none left. But no matter, for more were only behind me. I wouldn't have to move from my seat. Told you this was a handy job.

I placed my book in front of the camera screen, which had three cameras pointing out into the forecourt, and one looking down the aisle in front of my till. So, reaching behind me I picked up a packet of John player blue (my x brand) and went to pay.

Unfortunately I had to get up this time, because my wallet was in my jacket, in the staff room. I went and got it, paid for my smokes, took one out, lit it, and went to pick up my book, and froze. On the camera was a man standing in front of my till. (I must say before I continue, that up until this moment I had had other spirit encounters, yet I still froze, nay freeze every time I see the extraordinary) This was bad news for two reasons and a third to follow, one the front door was locked! Magnetically, nobody was in the shop, I'd checked earlier, or, could get in the shop. Two, it was him. The first ghost I'd ever seen, standing in front of my till. I stood, staring, transfixed to the screen for a few minutes. Eventually I looked up from the screen to where he should have been, but the area was empty. This would have been ok if it wasn't for the third thing, he was still on the camera when I looked back down. This continued for five minutes, and then he turned away from me and vanished.

I smoked every cigarette in that box and ten more in a row, just to relax myself. This time there was no voice or touching, but he left a mark. I could still feel his presence.

After this I never worked the late shift but did the afternoon shift instead for a few more months, then quit to work in a clothes shop.

T his is the continuation of my experiences from the house in the woods . It has now been over a month since we moved into the house. An almost crippling feeling of hopelessness, desperation and extreme sorrow washes over me whenever I am there. It feels as if I am doomed, as if God has abandoned me. I can't put into words the feeling that has come over me, it's like eternal darkness in my soul.

I hear voices coming from empty rooms. Things turn up missing on a regular basis only to appear at a later time in their original place. I heard what sounded like my kitchen being destroyed, glass breaking, things being thrown, cabinet doors slamming, but when I entered nothing was out of place.

I have started reading the bible aloud as I walk through the house. As I read the bible doors have slammed, windows have rattled, I have heard banging on the floors above me. On one occasion I heard a frightening voice say ""your God is ailing he can't help you"".

One evening I dozed off on the sofa while watching tv, I was jarred awake by the volume of the tv going to full blast. I opened my eyes and saw a young man standing over me. He looked to be in his early 20's, had filthy shoulder length brown hair and filthy clothes. As I lay there staring back at him he gave a smile that revealed the most disgusting brown teeth I have ever seen. He then walked toward the dining room. I arose and cautiously followed him, when I entered the dining room it was empty, but there was a putrid smell lingering in the air.

I started to notice why it seemed to be so quiet, although the house was surrounded by a large wooded area, I never heard birds chirping during the day, nor did I ever hear crickets at night. The only thing that seemed to live in the woods was the stray dog my wife adopted. She quickly befriended him and called him Shadow because of his jet black coat. Shadow is a large black haired male, a sheep dog I believe, he is a slow moving old boy who comes around for his free meal every evening. Shadow won't enter the house and never seems to come any closer than 10 feet from the back porch. Strangely enough he seems to have no fear of the woods and retreats there every night. I often hear Shadow howling incessantly in the woods at night. I don't know what it is about Shadow but I feel safe when he is around. I just wish I could get him into the house at night.

Over the past few weeks my wife has become severely withdrawn, she spends nearly all her time in the room on the third floor. I have heard her talking to someone up there, but when I mentioned it she became extremely defensive and said I am trying to make her sound insane. I tried to point out the change in her behavior and she became enraged, she started screaming, cursing, smashing dishes, and then stormed out of the house into the woods. It was well after midnight by the time she came back. We were able to sit down and talk, she admitted that there was several presences in the house and that she had been in contact with some. She said they needed us there and wanted her to bring me in. When I asked what she meant by that she became agitated and stormed up the stairs. She shouted from the top of the stairs he's getting stronger he will return. I wonder if something is using her, or if something has driven her insane.

"Third Time, Not Good Company",Ireland,A Haunted Life,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: A Haunted Life :: Third Time, Not Good Company

H ere is the final chapter in this story. If you've read First Time Experience and Second Encounter with the Same Entity you're up to date. This story ended after I saw him for the third time. I would guess it's because his hold on me got weaker, or maybe he stretched himself too thin reaching me for a third time. Who knows. All I know for certain is that this time he didn't scare me as bad as the last two times.

John Doyle's pub situated in Phibsboro, Cabra, is a nice place for a drink. It has recently changed management, but it retains a pleasant atmosphere. Except the third floor, when I worked there.

A bit of geography, the third floor separates itself with a staircase. On the opposite side of the staircase is the male toilets (third floor) and opposite this is the storage room. It contains plates and so forth, and it's only accessible through the second floor bar, through a door on the far left corner. A small hallway with staircase, leads up to it. There are stories of what has happened in the room, but they are not mine so I won't tell them. In my opinion though, from what I did hear about these stories, it's another spirit, or because of some many differences, made up.

We were just finished for the night. I'd stopped serving, and had gone downstairs to have a smoke, and a glass of coke, leaving my lounge girl upstairs with a few stragglers, and a few tables to clear.

Having finished my smoke I started to climb back upstairs to finish closing the bar, cashing up, re stocking the fridges, and because it was a saturday, scrubbing the floors. When I was knocked aside by two guys, with a look of absolute terror on their faces. I ran up the rest of the stairs to make sure Tracy was ok. She was standing at the bar entrance looking at the far corner door (always locked) her mouth open. This wasn't the first thing I noticed. You will all understand what I felt first. Cold spots. My body passed through one. It really made me shiver. At this point of my life I'm use to this feeling. Accustomed to hearing my name called, touched, and seeing people you know shouldn't be with you. I walked over to Tracy and asked ""What happened?"" She shrugged at first and then in a moment of clarity she said ""They knocked on the door, for a laugh I guess..."" she paused, it looked like she was struggling with belief and disbelief, ""then someone knocked back, NO!, kicked back"". Apparently the door had been pushed out with incredible force in answer to the inebriated fools knocking. She then sat down and cried. I soothed her, told her there was nothing to worry about (at this point temperature had returned to normal and I wasn't having images screaming through my mind) and poured her a nice bacardi and coke. I've never seen anyone drink as quick as Tracy did.

After she knocked back her drink she set off upstairs to clean the toilets. If I haven't made this clear I will now, the stairs for the toilets are located in the middle of the bar, away from the other door. I said I'd clean the gents and bring down the rubbish if she left it at the top of the stairs. Once she'd done this she could go home. So off she had gone leaving me alone on the second floor. There was nothing out of place, so I went up to the male toilets. After cleaning the big urinal tank that resides in all male toilets I went to clean the only cubicle it possessed.

Just before I entered I noticed the toilet door opening, reflected in the mirror, and I informed this person that we were closed for cleaning. The guys downstairs use to send people up to use the third floor toilets as a joke on me, so I wasn't surprised, and without turning around to confront this guy I went about cleaning.

I came out of the cubicle and looked about the empty room. Looking for anything I missed, which was nothing, I turned to clean the mirror and there he was, same smile, same maliciousness. He stood roughly 5'8"", with short hair, unshaved for a while it seemed, regular pair of slacks, and a blue faded shirt. His hands were balled up into fists. I was scared, but at 20 years of age, I'm not scared of these things for long. Too many encounters.

So with a bit of force I screamed at the mirror F%@k off! Nothing happened, he stayed were he was. I turned, looked at him, and walked towards him. Didn't confront him just walked past him, through the toilet door, picking up the rubbish, and listening to his laugh fade away. For the last time, but I didn't know this then.

When I was walking home that night, I started shaking. My mind was flooded with after images. I got home curled into my girlfriend at the time who knew straight away what was wrong (didn't know it was that guy, just knew I was after seeing something, same as when we were in cork together) and she made me a cup of tea, and asked about what happened. She was the best. That's the completed version of that entity. He hasn't been back since. I'm 27 now and I still visit the pub on occasion, but without encounters.

Ria's Strange Man Appears Again,United Kingdom,Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: Ria's Strange Man Appears Again

I f you haven't read my previous Strange Man stories then I'll fill you in. My middle sister Ria randomly sees the outline/shadow of a man in our house. Now she's the only family member to have seen him. There have been logical explanations such as burglars or random hallucinations but she is adamant it cannot be those solutions.

The most recent experience was on New Years Eve. Everybody was out celebrating. However my middle sister came home (leaving her boyfriend Craig back at a local nightclub) as she was tired and couldn't be bothered with the crowds of new years.

She was upstairs and just walked out of her room. Now her bedroom looks across the landing and down the stairs. So as she walked out she saw (in the dark) a man (no detail as it was dark) walk across the entry bottom of the stairs. She then shouted out ""Craig I thought you would of gone home afterwards?"" but there was no reply.

My sister is quite lazy so instead of going downstairs and checking the door/window locks (that apparently were locked) she rang Craig on her mobile phone. She asked him ""why are you downstairs, I thought you would have gone home? Come up here will ya"" Then Craig replied ""What are you on about, I am at my home, not yours?!""

On hearing this Ria refused to leave her room. Until the morning when everyone came home.

So whether this was another random burglar who steals nothing or her Strange man, who knows. My mum does have a theory though that it's my granddad as when he was alive he was always round our house doing D.I.Y.

Evil Angel,"South Dakota, United States",Children Who See Spirits,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Children Who See Spirits :: Evil Angel

M e and my family once lived in a small town called Red Shirt. We had a new house that was built when I was little. We would do a lot of things in the house when it was done. My cousins would come over to play, we would play in the basement. Playing ""Hide and Seek"", playing in the dark. Before my sister Cecelia had friends, my mother said that she would be in the basement, talking to herself and laughing. My mom was thinking that I was down there. But when it was lunch time, she would come up alone. This is when we were just little girls. And I came in from outside along with my brother Tim.

My sister said that she was playing with a angel in the basement. But the more she was playing with us outside, the more the angel become evil. Mad because my sister was making friends with others. And when my sister decided to go down and see the angel, the thing she was looking at was nothing like the angel. It had red eyes, and a scary voice, and it was in the dark. She tried to explain to him that she was outside with us but the more she tried to talk to him, the more he was mad. He tried to attack her but she ran up.

Nowadays when we try to go to sleep, you can hear someone coming up the stairs and going down them too. And every time we go down to wash clothes, we have a weird feeling. Once my mother tried to wash clothes, she saw something in the corner of the basement and she ran up. We decided to move.

After that my sister didn't talk to herself anymore. Now every time we go and see the house, we have a feeling that we're not welcome. My cousin and her mother moved in so we ask them if they hear anything at night but they say... ""No we don't but once in a well we hear footsteps. But that it""

The House on Cambridge 4,"Ohio, United States",Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: The House on Cambridge 4

T his is yet another installment in The House on Cambridge series. A little background on the situation: my parents bought a large Victorian home in Columbus, Ohio in the early 1990s. My mother and brother began experiencing paranormal ocurrences almost immediately. These vignettes deal with my stepfather coming to terms with what had been happening to his wife and son for almost a year. Until these episodes, he was not a ""believer...""

My stepfather is a highly rational, intelligent, practical man. He is a carpenter-turned-attorney. He was constantly doing renovation work to our house from about the first month we moved in until we moved out. Thanks to his ingenuity and work, my parents tripled the value of the house in the 14 years they lived there. Unfortunately, not everybody in the house liked the changes...

This string of incidents took place around 1994 after we'd been in the house for a few short years. My mother had seen and heard strange things since the first day she stepped into the house. My little brother quickly became a lightning rod for the supernatural and often complained to my parents in the middle of the night that he could not sleep because ""the lady is in my room..."" This lady often pulled at his sheets and on a few ocassions, even tickled him. My mother heard this lady walking around the landing and down the steps some nights at about 4:30 AM. Her noise was so distinct, my mother could even hear the sound of a heavy dress slipping down the steps after her as she descended the stairs.

Both she and my brother vocalized their concerns to my stepfather, but to little avail. If you haven't seen or felt a ""ghost,"" then you cannot possibly understand the emotion with which it floods you. I do not blame anyone who has not experienced this for not understanding. However, once you are stricken, your world turns upside down and there is no going back. My stepfather would soon make this transition.

One night, my stepfather was in bed reading while my mother tucked-in her brood of five children. He was lying in bed with his back to the wall. The doorway to their room was to his right and built into the same wall against which he was resting as he sat upright reading. The door was slightly ajar as my mother stepped through the doorway and into their room. As she took her second step into their room, my stepfather looked up to acknowledge her. When he looked up from his book towards her, he saw a milky white, whispy apparition trail her into the room at exceedingly close range and with some velocity. It was as if this thing was literally on my mother's heels. My stepfather could make out little except for her white hair and what appeared to be a white gown, hence, the ""white lady...""

She came into the room so fast and close to my mother, that she overtook her and flew past my mom and disappeared into the room before her. My mother's hair flew up and past her own face as if a gust of wind had blown into the back of her head. Upon witnessing this paranormal interactoin, my stepfather, who did NOT believe in ghosts one minute before sat up sharply in bed with his eyes widened. He gasped in alarm, ""What the hell was that?!"" To which Mom replied, ""You know damn well what I think it was...""

After that, my stepfather had no choice but to believe. Perhaps it was because he was now tuned-in to the possibility of a haunted house, perhaps it was just coincidence, but after this initial baptism, my stepfather had many other run-ins with entities unbound by commonly accepted rules of physics.

One night, while both he and his wife were fast asleep, he awoke unexpectedly. He felt as though something had woken him up. Startled, he peered into the darkness and his blood ran frigid at what he saw. There, hovering RIGHT over him in his bed, was a black cloud of what he can only describe as ""energy..."" It was large, looming, and not friendly. He sat up in bed and yelled out, ""What the hell's going on here?!?!"" At this, the hazy dark mass raised up a foot or so and slowly backed away from their bed across the room and receded into a foundation wall of the house. There was no other room on the other side of this wall as it formed the outside of our house.

His screaming of course awakened my mother and they discussed what had just transpired. My mother always insisted whatever was in the house never threatened her and that it was friendly. She liked to believe it was the spirit of a previous owner who liked to stop on the landing atop the stairs and peer out into the back yard to admire her garden. That's all well and good, but still pure conjecture. She may have never felt threatened, but that was not the case with my stepfather. He firmly believed that whatever he saw race into the room behind Mom and what appeared over their bed that night were separate entities. He also felt the looming cloud was indeed threatening and not friendly. He felt it better not to share this feeling with my mother.

After that, I would say that my stepfather was the tertiary witness to these ocurrences behind my brother and mother respectively. His encounters with the supernatural in that house would increase over the years to the point where he didn't even bother telling anyone about them. On several occasions, he saw a figure in the carriage house out back. This structure had once housed horses and a carriage when the house was first built in the very late 1890s. Now, it served as my stepfather's work space, full of table saws, welding equipment, etc. The second floor of this building had also once been home to the butler of the house. Now, this space was used as my stepfather's office out of which he ran his law practice. There are four windows in this room--two look out on the neighbors property, and two look out towards the main house. My stepfather would often walk from the main house down the path to the carriage house and up and into his office to work on cases at night. On several occasions, as he walked to his office, he would look up to see someone peering down at him from the second floor windows. He could not make out distinct facial features, but he knew from the shape of the head and torso that it was a man. He found this particularly unnerving, and for that reason, did not tell my mother about ""him"" until recently.

It is curious to me that, out of a family of seven, a few would have only positive encounters with the supernatural, one would have some negative ones, three would have sparse and indistinct experiences, and one would never have any at all. Do you see only what you want to see, or only what you are allowed to see?

Grandpa Said Goodbye,"California, United States",Family / Friends Visits,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Family / Friends Visits :: Grandpa Said Goodbye

A s a child I spent a great deal of time with my paternal grandparents. My grandpa was very religious and did his best to make sure we knew the Lord as well. He lived the later years of his life unable to leave his house. So when I could go visit him it was very special to me.

In 1998, he had a stroke and was hospitalized. We all went to see him, not knowing if he would survive, he was almost 80 years old. In the hospital, he kept asking his wife to come closer, he said he missed her so much and he loved her still. My grandmother found this very odd as she was sitting right next to him and never left his side. He kept saying ""Margaret I love you"", my grandmother's name was Beverly. He was seeing his first wife standing in the corner and was asking her to come to him. She died in 1975. I was the only grandchild that never got to meet her. He never stopped loving her. This hurt my grandmothers feelings very much. For his recovery he had to go to a convalescent home. He never did recover enough to go home.

I had just gotten off from working a twelve hour day and was very tired. I went to my bedroom and fell asleep, At that time I was 20 years old and not prone to flights of fancy, I have always been a very grounded person. I was asleep in my room with the door closed as I normally did, I was awakened by the door opening, (I lived alone just me and my dog and he can't open doors) and my room lighting up, I looked up and my grandpa was standing in the door way. Standing! He wasn't able to stand on his own since the stroke.

I looked up and said ""Hi grandpa"", He said ""I have to go home now. I just wanted to say I love you"" I remember thinking this was odd. He can't go home, he needs the care at the convalescent home, but I didn't say anything except that I loved him to. He said ""Goodbye, I love you"". To that I replied goodbye, I love you to. Then he was gone. I closed my door and went back to sleep.

About three hours later I was awakened to the the phone ringing. When I answered it, it was my dad and he was crying. He said that my grandpa had passed away a few hours ago. It took a few minutes for what he said to sink in, because I was still asleep. Then I told him that grandpa said was going home, so how could he have died? He just said ""What?"" I did not tell him of grandpa's visit, I did not want him to think I was crazy. I did not tell anyone that until about a year ago.

The Man Moved With Us,"California, United States",Children Who See Spirits,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Children Who See Spirits :: The Man Moved With Us

I n 2002, my husband committed suicide. Our son was 8 months old. We moved back to California to start our lives over again. I had to live with my parents, in their basement for a year until I could get back on my feet. My son was 18 months old when we got our own house. We were both excited, he finally had his own room, and we both could have a new start.

Within the first week, my son who had always slept in his own bed, insisted on sleeping with me. I thought it was just the new house, not being familiar yet. Over the next few weeks, I tried to get him to sleep in his room. If I laid down with him, he would fall asleep. The first time he saw the Man in his room I was terrified. He woke me up and told me the Man in his room won't let him sleep. I jumped out of bed, my first thought was what were my dogs doing letting a stranger in the house? I went into his room and found all three of my dogs growling, at what I could not see. I turned on all the lights and searched the house for the Man my son told me about. The only thing I found was my dogs still growling in my son's room. We both slept on the couch that night with the dog's at our feet.

Over the next year my son would still not sleep in his room. The Man terrified him. The dog's insisted on sleeping with us every night. I often felt uneasy in that house, it felt very heavy, that is the best way I can describe it. The dog's would often bark like they cornered something. On one occasion they even charged the sliding glass door from the outside trying to get in. I opened the door and they started chasing something in the house. They ran into my son's room then stopped and started growling.

My son slept with me every night we lived in that house. My son also had ""brothers"" while we lived there. He would play with them outside in the sand, he would play games in the house like hide-and-seek when it was raining. He told me that his three brothers wanted me to be their mommy also. Those brothers got him in a lot of trouble. Things would get broken, and moved and he would say his brothers did it. That they were trying to get him in trouble. Then he started to tell me that they were mean to him and always got mad at him. I asked him to ask them what there names were, he always said they would not tell him. At his point he was only 2 1/2 years old.

Two years later when I re-married and moved, all seamed quiet. Then little things started to happen. My son was afraid to sleep alone. He is now afraid of the dark. The dog's would bark for no reason. And the brothers showed up again. They were a point of distress for my husband. The ceiling fan in my son's room would move very slowly backwards when it was not set for backwards and was not turned on. I asked my son if he used something tall, like a broom, to spin it, he said no that the Man did it. The Man was back. Now he was older, I asked him what the Man looked like, he said just like a man, with brown hair.

Over the years I have thought it may be the spirit of his deceased father trying to contact him. I have often told him, if it is him bothering our son to leave him alone, he is scared. Then I tried telling my deceased husband if it is NOT him bothering our son to protect him, because he is scared. I'm still not sure which one it is.

Now our daughter wakes up at night saying that the Man won't let her sleep. My husband is not sure what to think. He is not sure what to believe. I have always believed in the paranormal, but he was raised strictly Catholic, and that stuff does not happen. I have smudged the house when I was the only one home. Everything seamed to quiet down, but not completely. I feel there is something here. I ask my spirit guide to help me, guide me and protect us.

The Hypnotist Ghost,"Wisconsin, United States",Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: The Hypnotist Ghost

T his story is about my very first, and so far most frightening, encounter with the paranormal. Before I begin on what I experienced that night with my two friends, let's call them Tracy and Samantha, background information is needed. Tracy and Samantha are twin sisters who live in a small house on the lake, located in the south-eastern area of Wisconsin. I had visited their house many times before, and on every trip I would have to pass by this very small cottage, which was actually the size of a shed. It was very obvious the cottage was abandoned since the windows were smashed out, and the door was boarded up.

One day while taking a walk with Tracy past the cottage, I looked over to her and said, ""Did someone actually live there? Look how small it is"". ""Yeah, a long time ago,"" Tracy replied to the best of her knowledge. She went on to tell me about a ""hypnotist ghost"" that actually lived in the house. Curious about the ghost, I asked her what she meant. She explained to me that a couple of years ago, a friend of hers, who lived in the neighborhood, was on her way over to the local bar to get some food after leaving Tracy's house. About three hours had passed by without any sign from her friend. Tracy and the girl's parents finally found her standing in front of the small cottage, staring into the window appearing to be ""hypnotized...""

Now, I know how much Tracy likes to exaggerate on some things (the three hours for example), but for some reason I believed that her friend actually did see something in the cottage that was able to catch her attention. My odd feelings for that house increased every time I had to drive by it, and since there was no other way to get to their house without going passed that cottage, I had to.

It wasn't until a Friday night in the summer of last year, that the story about the ghost in that cottage really made me believe. The twins and I, along with some other friends had gone to see a late movie. Since I picked the twins up, I was in charge of taking them home that night.

As my car pulled onto their road, I couldn't help but think about having to pass that creepy cottage again. As we neared the house, I looked over at Tracy who was sitting in the front seat (Samantha was sitting behind Tracy in the back) and say, ""Man, I really hate that house!"" Just as soon as I finished expressing my views on the cottage, I felt this weird jolt of some sort of energy pass through the right side of my body. To this day, I still can't fully describe the feeling, it was like an energy, but unique in some way. The feeling actually froze me for a few seconds until we were clear of the cottage. Pulling into the twins' driveway, I looked over at Tracy. ""I just got the weirdest feeling as we went by that house,"" I said. ""Yeah I felt that too! On the left side of my body!"" she replied. ""I felt it on my right!""

We sat in the car for a few seconds, trying to explain the feeling to each other. Meanwhile, Samantha was in the back seat looking at us like we were both crazy. When I asked her if she felt anything as we went by the house, she said nothing seemed strange to her.

The cottage was eventually knocked down later in the summer, and now I don't fear having to pass it on my way to their house. It was an experience I will never forget.

Childhood Experience,United Kingdom,Apparitions / Voices / Touches,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Apparitions / Voices / Touches :: Childhood Experience

I 'm not a person for flights of fancy, I'm educated and pretty rational, but this experience I had as a child I still often think of and wonder how anyone could rationally explain it...

It would have happened around 1976, making me 6yrs old at the time, and really it was a pretty nasty and frightening experience.

The bedroom I slept in at the time was a large one and I shared it with my older brother. There were two beds in the room, a double one and a small single one, and the beds were place side by side.

One night I was asleep and woken by what felt like a slap in the face. Waking up immediately I could see there was no one there, but looking across to the other side of the room, to the other side of the bed that my brother was asleep in, I could see a large, luminous white hand pointing straight up and almost touching the ceiling, its palm outstretched, and just there unmoving.

Obviously I was terrified and cried out, my mother came into the room and turned the light on and it vanished.

I have no doubt in my mind I saw what I saw, and also felt the slap in the face, this was in no way my imagination, I was staring straight at this thing for a good half minute.

Also, much later on as an adult I finally told my brother about it, and he went as white as a sheet and said he'd seen it too. But neither of us know whether it was the same night.

Haunted Trailer in Michigan,"Michigan, United States",Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: Haunted Trailer in Michigan

I n 1986 I was divorced with two small children under the age of 4. We stayed with my sister for a year until I could afford our own place.  Finally I found our dream home. It was a pretty three bedroom green and 14x70 feet with three bedrooms in it. Just right I thought for us so I bought it. This trailer was in Ypsilanti, Michigan. USA.

My children and I moved in around the end of November 1987. All seemed okay for a period of time. One weekend near the spring time of 1988 my children went to their dad's house for the weekend visit and I was there by myself I was awaken in the middle of the night with the water running full blast in the bathroom which was the room next to mine. I got up looked to see the water on and when I went to turn it off I noticed then it was on as far as it could be on. I could not figure out what made it do that. So thought nothing of the matter and went back to bed.

My sons came back home on Sunday. A few days later my oldest son Jimmy comes into the bedroom in the middle of the night telling me the water faucet was on did I forget to turn it off. I told him I did not have it on, and that I found it one night while they were gone. Which I should not of said as it frighten my son.

A week or so went by all calmed down my children were sleeping in their own rooms again when I heard my oldest son running down the hallway with his brother in tow, ""mama mama we are frighten can we sleep in here"". I asked them what was the matter and my oldest son Jimmy said ""the water was on mama again I went to turn it off and it just turned off while I watched it"" he said. After that happen my sons would not sleep in their own rooms until they were much older.

In early summer of 1988 I went to go into my son Jimmy's room and he told me to stop I would step on his friend. I looked around I didn't see anyone. I said where is your friend? He said by the door. I stepped back peered into the room I didn't see anything or feel anything. I told him okay I would not come in when his friend left let me know.

From 1988 until we moved in 1996 things that were unexplained kept happening in the trailer One night my son Jimmy was sitting in the kitchen behind me with a toy car that had a wire on it and was remote control. I took out the batteries and told him I have to get more before he could use it again. Suddenly the car started up right by my sons feet and went around and around in circles for a few times then settled down and was dead again. My son and I just looked in amazement but were not frighten.

My mom and her sister came over to watch a movie with us this was in the early 1990s. We were in the living room and all of a sudden the can opener came on it sounded as if a can was being opened only their was no one near it and we all turned around to see what was happening. My aunt asked if this happen often I told her not that, it was a first but other things have happen since the children and I were here. No one seemed frighten and we just continued watching the movie.

In late summer of 1993 my Mother passed away and I could not sleep for days after she died. I was laying in my bed wishing I could sleep, I then smelled lilacs like the perfume she use to buy from Avon for years when I was a child. I said ""Mom I love you and miss you thanks for coming"" after that I slept for hours. After my Mom died things in the trailer seemed to act up more often. People would walk half way down the hallway and the lights would come on when we got close to my bedroom they would go off. Some people never came back to my house after that. Sometimes I would nearly be to my bedroom and the hall lights go off and the bedroom lights would come on. I said ""Ok Mom you have frighten me stop that"" and the light would go back off and I felt fine.

Early in the fall of 1993 I could hear voices in the hallway, my children were in school I was the only one there in my bedroom. I stepped out into the hallway expecting to see someone there and yet seen no one. The water faucet came on full blast, I went into the bathroom and yelled ""ok stop this right now I am tired of this dam water coming on all the time stop it"" the water went off. And it never did come on again.

In July of 1992 this guy Camerlo came to live with my children and I. One day he came to where I worked and asked me ""Why didn't you tell me your place is haunted?"" I said what you talking about and he told me this: I was getting ready to take a shower. I turned off the stereo and tv I was walking down the hallway to the bathroom and I heard the stereo on so I went back to see why it was on, when I got to the living room the knob that said off was off but the stereo was on. He left the room went took his shower on his way back out of the bathroom he heard the tv on. When he got to the living room the knob was off, and the tv was on with a picture of a movie. He said he got frighten and left the house to come and tell me about it where I worked. I just laughed told him that happens and other stuff too.

In June 1996 my children and I were packing up to leave we were relocating elsewhere. I was coming up the hallway and my son Jimmy who was in the kitchen said ""STOP MOM"" I did and asked why, he said to me: ""as I came into the kitchen to get ready to eat breakfast I seen a little old lady from the waist up floating across the living room and going down the hallway towards you and I didn't want you to walk over her"". I didn't feel anything and my son said she just floated right through me. I asked him if he knew who it was he said: ""I don't know how I know this actually, Mom, but I know it was grandma and she looked like she was sad we are not going to live here no more.""

We had cats and when I be home alone with them, they would rare up at the end of the hallway slap at something I could not see their hair was on end, their eyes were big black saucers. This would last about a minute and then the cats would come down the hallway as if nothing had happen. I would often find my cats coward behind chairs in the morning when I got up and never could figure out what had frighten them.

The final good bye. The next morning my children and I would be moved out of the trailer and on our way to our new home far away from Ypsilanti, Michigan. That night I washed up went to stand in front of my door length mirror on the closet door. I stood their looking around thinking how much I loved living here with what ever was here living with us. What it was I had no idea yet I was only frighten a few times and what ever was in our trailer didn't ever hurt us at all. I kind of hated to leave the trailer as I knew what ever it was here would not travel with us would stay behind perhaps bother others who did live here next.

So as I was thinking of all this running through my mind and looking into my mirror, I thought I seen something from the corner of my eye, I looked to the right of me out the bedroom door which I could see easily the hallway I could not see anything, but felt there was something out there looking at me. I looked back into the mirror, looked down and when I looked back into the mirror over my left shoulder the reflection I could see was my Mom's face as if she were standing over my shoulder behind me looking into the mirror. I just kept looking it seemed like a long time I wanted to be held by her, she looked sad in the mirror I smiled she just looked the same. I turned around and there was not anyone there behind me. I looked around the room no one could the naked eye see. I looked back into the mirror she was gone forever.

We left the next day June 29, 1996. I went back for years by that trailer and always wonder if what ever was there when my children and I lived their was still lurking around doing their own thing. My son Jimmy went by last year where we lived in that trailer court. It's still there the trailer court, the trailer we lived in is no longer their however. And still I think of that haunted trailer with the memories etched into my mind where I raised my babies until teens and all that went on in there and yet we were never hurt, surprised and sometimes scared but not hurt.

Copies of Me,Philippines,Misc,"W hen I read a couple of stories in this site, specially the Doppelganger by bbyghurlx3, I've decided to share my story too. I've never seen anybody copied, instead, I was the one being copied twice.

First started when I was a kid, 9 years of age. My cousin has 2 sons, the eldest was 4 and the youngest is 2. There was an electrical interruption then (brownout) in our area so it is a hot night for them. My cousin decided to bring her sleeping kids down from the room to the sala where it is more cooler. She first brought down the youngest. And when she was about to enter the room again to get his eldest, she heard that her eldest son is awake and talking to somebody.

She was filled with fear entering the room. After some minutes of getting some guts, she finally managed to enter the room found her son sleeping again. She asked her son in the morning whom is he talking to last night and he answered with no double thoughts that it was me and and Tito Carlo (Carlo is my other cousin 7 years of age then, we were both called by him as Tito, Uncle in english). As my nephew grew up, he realizes that he is able to see what other can't see. He's third eye is open and he's getting used to it.

Second was when I was in college, we rented an apartment at Sta Mesa, Manila. This serves as our group workplace for our thesis. One night, my groupmate was suddenly awaken and saw me at the corner of their room seems texting in the middle of the night (he recognizes me because of the flash of, what he claims, cell phone light on my face). He was quite surprised because we sleep in separate room (each room consists of 4. We are all boys in the apartment). Since he's my friend and he knew me, he does not bother to wake hes roommates.

He just ask me ""Sinong tinetext mo pre, girlfriend mo? Tulog ka na..."" (Who are you texting, your girlfriend?. You might go to sleep as well). But he never heard any response and immediately got to sleep. In the morning when he woke up, he asked me what am I doing in their room late in the evening. I answered ""No I did not. I'm asleep all night in our room. I never entered your room last night..."". I was never been a sleepwalker or even a sleeptexter. In his disbelief he just say ""Wag kang magbiro ng ganyan, ikaw talaga yung kausap ko kagabi..."" (Dont play jokes on me like that, I'm sure that it was you I'm talking to last night). After several arguments, he finally believes that it was not 'me' whom he was talking to but the other 'me'.

Now that I'm 5 years working, so far there is no third incident yet, but, who knows. The Doppelganger at the apartment made me remember of the first Doppelganger I just then told myself ""Oh, it's Me, me and me again"".

The Devil's Face,Canada,Apparitions / Voices / Touches,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Apparitions / Voices / Touches :: The Devil's Face

I was downstairs in the rec room, half asleep on the couch, not yet asleep. When I closed my eyes, I seen the devil's face. I immediately opened them, ran to the window to let the light in (sun was starting to set) and seen his face outside the window. I ran upstairs and couldn't even talk to my parents about it for I was so terrified, I could not speak.

Once I regained my breathing and calmed down, about a half hour later, I told them what I had witnessed. My parents were speechless and tried to reassure me that I just had a bad dream. Yet I seen him when I was awake. There were no horns on his head. He had lots of thick hair and it was flowing upwards, dark and straight, and his eye were red. This was when we lived in Saskatoon, Saskatchewan. I was 13 years old.

Several times throughout my life, I have encountered him again but only in my dreams. Two other times, wearing a black top hat and long coat.

1) Levitating outside my window on the 2nd floor, and I knew he wanted me to open the window and let him in and I woke up. This was in Winnipeg, Manitoba. I was 18 years old.

2) In the other dream, I was walking along a path, coming from a barn of some sort and it's raining really hard. As I get closer to the cottage, I see my sister in the window reading a book by candle light. He is all of a sudden right beside me, walking with me and our thoughts are not said out loud. We stop and face each other and he pulls out a gun and shoots me 3 times in the hip. As I am going down, dying, I scream to my sister to get out of the cottage now! I wake up crying, scared and in pain. The right side of my hip was swollen and sore. It hurt for about 3 days and then the pain was gone. This happened in Winnipeg, Manitoba. I was 23 years old.

I've had one other experience about life and the universe, which I will share another time.

The Grocery Store Ghost,"Tennessee, United States",Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: The Grocery Store Ghost

I n August of 1994 I started working at a small mom and pop type grocery store in the small town where I live. After having worked there for little over a year, I was promoted to evening manager with the responsibility of making sure the store was cleaned and the register was cleared and counted, ready for the next day's business.

One evening in the spring of '96, I had an experience that I shall never forget. I had already locked up for the night (we closed at 9:00 pm), finished mopping and was in the office counting up the register when it started.

I first heard what sounded like a radio that was off-station turned up full blast. I left the office, thinking it was the intercom going haywire, but upon inspection found that it was turned off. I then proceeded to check out the stockroom and meat room. When I got at the meat room door that's when the moaning, wailing, crying and crazy laughing started, in addition the the static sound. I was starting to get a little spooked, not thinking spooks or anything but that maybe someone was inside the store trying to scare me or scare me off. I immediately went to the office and got the 357 magnum and made a thorough sweep of the store both inside and out and found absolutely nothing. Now I was scared, now I was thinking spooks.

All the time that I was checking, the sounds were still going on, I had isolated them to the meat room and I wanted someone else to hear them for my own sanity's sake. I called the day shift meat cutter and talked to his wife but he wasn't at home. By the time I hung the phone up and got back into the meat room the sounds stopped. I was standing in the meat room trying to comprehend what had just happened when, for the first time, I heard talking that I could understand. It was a man and a woman.

The woman said, ""Do you think he's had enough,"" to which the man replied, ""No, let's do it again..."" It then started up all over again, even louder.

Even though I was scared, I wasn't going to let it run me out before I finished doing my job. My employer, whom I considered a friend as well, was counting on me and I wasn't going to let him down. I went back to the office and finished up, in record time I might add.

About the time I finished, the noise stopped and the phone rung. It was the butcher wanting to know what was wrong, his wife told him that I sounded like I was scared to death. I told him that I would tell him the next day, that I was going home.

The next day I told the butcher what happened and asked him to not tell the boss. Well he told him anyway and the next thing I knew I was called in the office to recount the whole story again. Oh great, now the boss will think that his evening manager is loony tunes. To my surprise he believed me and made me promise that if it happened again, to call him. He told me that he had heard stuff there too but not on this big a scale.

I have seen and heard other things in my nearly thirteen years working at that store but this was by far the most upsetting.

Am I Haunted?,"Rhode Island, United States",A Haunted Life,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: A Haunted Life :: Am I Haunted?

I 'd like to share the strangest of the strange moments I've had here but first I need to explain this: I live in a 3rd story apartment building on the 1st floor. Before this became an apartment building, I believe the first floor was a laundromat and a store back in the day. Half was the laundromat, half was the store.

Back in '03 I had a pet rabbit named Alaska (RIP, buddy, I miss you). Due to the rules the landlord had set, he had to be kept in the basement. My grandfather built him a cute little house-looking thing for him to be kept in. One night I went downstairs to feed him. Keep in mind I've ALWAYS thought the basement was eerie. As I was was facing his cage and putting the bowl of water inside, a big shadow appeared behind me, as if a big, tall man were standing behind me. I turned around and nobody was there, but I got the distinct feeling that I was being watched. I basically dropped the water bowl and ran upstairs yelling for my mom. Ever since then I can't go down there alone.

Last year, my mom was doing the dishes in the kitchen. We don't have a dishwasher, so she would set the dishes in the plastic dish dryer next to the sink. We talked for a moment and I left the room for a second. When I came back my mom exclaimed, ""Did you do that?!"" I said ""Huh?"" and she pointed to where the wet dishes were drying. There was a glass placed perfectly straight and standing up on top of all the dishes. It wasn't there when I left the room and I was only gone for about 3 seconds. Not to mention the glass wasn't even wet...

My room has to be the room I feel most creeped out in. Once I was trying to get to sleep, and I sleep with the lights off. All of sudden I felt the urge to leave the room, almost like a gut feeling, but I couldn't get out of my bed, I was too scared. The feeling of someone peering at me was so intense, I was physically afraid to move or breathe. I opened my blinds to let the street light in (my lamp is across the room), thinking the light would help me feel better to move. That did nothing. I must have sat there on my bed for about fifteen minutes before I leapt out of my bed and out my room. I didn't sleep in there that night. I've never felt anything so intense!

Another time, I couldn't sleep. Literally. It was almost as if someone was trying to physically keep me awake. Every time I closed my eyes and almost drifted off to sleep my eyes would snap open in terror. It's like I was scared to sleep, like someone wouldn't let me. I finally fell asleep around five thirty in the morning.

Then there's all the little things, like seeing things in the corner of my eye, hearing doors open or close when I'm home alone, the feeling of being watched. Once when my sister wasn't home (we share a room) I heard someone breathing from her bed and heard the sheets rustle. Last week, I felt someone poking me in the shoulder when I was alone in my room. Over Christmas break, I had sleep paralysis three times. Sometimes (actually... quite often) I'll be looking at something and I'll see one or more contorted, angry faces.

I realize that when one is looking for something to happen, or creeps themselves out, they can make things happen or imagine it. These are the moments in which I know nothing was imagined, so I wanted to share them and get your opinions. Thanks so much.

Weird Encounter,"Florida, United States",Apparitions / Voices / Touches,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Apparitions / Voices / Touches :: Weird Encounter

W hen I was about 6 or 7 I was visiting one of parents friend which had a little boy. I was always uneasy at their home due to the fact that I knew her husband was what we cubans call a palero, it's a part of santero or santeria. Well that day his mom had came from cuba to visit him. I don't remember all the details, all I know was his mom went to take a shower and I really had to use the bathroom so I waited by the couch looking toward the bathroom door anxious, I really had to pee.

I see her open the bathroom door, she closes it behind her so I get up to go to the bathroom but when I try to open the door, it's locked, when I knock she says ""I'm in here"" I look toward the bedroom and see a shadow walk in the room put it this way I was going to sleep over there that night, I never spend the night ever again.

Until this day I can't understand why I this thing I saw looked like his mom. Another time my mom was visiting her sister. We were at this house she was staying in. I was sitting in the sofa when my mom screams for me I go to her and she tells me who was that colored lady dressed in red you were talking to. I told her I wasn't talking to anyone, she said ""well I saw here standing next to you, she look like she was talking to you"". My mom freaked and took me out of there I really didn't see nothing but my mom was so shook up I had to believe she really did see something.

The Cat in my Room,"Alaska, United States",Pets / Animals,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Pets / Animals :: The Cat in my Room

A couple months ago, before my latest birthday when I turned 14, I woke up in the middle of the night (not an uncommon thing for me). My door was shut, I was completely dark in my room, and I was right next to the wall. Nothing interesting had happened to me before bed, but when I woke up, I felt my heart stop for a second. Right in front of my face, a small cat was staring into my eyes. The cat was completely black, but he had a weird light outline so I could see him, and scraggly looking, like he just came off the street. His eyes were strangely large, and an amber/brown color.

As soon as I saw him, I took a swat at him, terrified out of my mind. I was even more frightened when my hand went through him. After that, he turned and quickly jumped to the edge of my bed and looked back at me one last time before he jumped to the floor. In my attempt to turn on my light, I hit my hand on my headboard, so I knew I wasn't dreaming. I got my light on, and there was no cat in my room. I already knew that it wasn't my pet black cat, Bo, since my door was closed, but I couldn't think of anything that could explain it. I stayed up for the next couple of minutes, trying to relax so I could get to sleep.

After that, I started to sleep with my door open and to go to bed before my mom so the light in the hall will be on. I haven't seen the cat since, but now my cat Bo comes in every other night and lays with me until I fall asleep. He usually will lay at the end of my bed and stare at my door, for no apparent reason. It's strange, but it also makes me feel better. This experience only seems to reinforce my belief that there's some sort of activity in my room.

Not Alone in New House,"North Carolina, United States",Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: Not Alone in New House

I 've always been able to sense the other side so to speak but what's going on now in my new house is just plain weird. I'm a big believer in reincarnation/past life - so I'm very open to the spiritual where my wife's view is more inside the box and doesn't believe very openly in ghosts. We've been in the house since late October '07. I of course immediately noticed cold spots, predominately in our bedroom accompanied by a smell of cigarette smoke (neither of us smoke).

The other night my 20mo son woke up crying around 3am. Being that my wife tends to the new born, I get up with the older one at night. Upon entering his room and lifting him out of his crib I noticed a dark figure about my wife's stature standing in the corner by the rocking chair. I thought my wife had followed me in because it was hard getting up to get my son so I was annoyed that she followed me in. I went and slept with my son on the couch. The next day I asked her why she followed me in. She proceeded to tell me that she hadn't. Granted I was half asleep but looking back, I should have known it wasn't her.

I was home with my son one night, he in bed me in the living room. I had the baby monitor in his room and the receiver with me. I heard my 20mo sirring and then a woman going, ""Shh shh shh"" ""Who loves you?"" ""I do"". I have never been so freaked out - I was wide awake. I went to his room to find him safe and sound, sleeping contently.

Most recently I had fallen asleep on the couch when I was awakened by what sounded to me like a rock hitting my living room window and a voice, I don't know how to explain this... It wasn't out loud but it was in my head, like a thought but not that of my own. The voice said, ""that woke 'em up!""

I work 2nd shift so two nights ago around 11:30 I had come home and was watching tv with my wife in the living room. We both heard a loud BANG come from my 20mo room. We both looked at each other and listened to see if he had woken but heard nothing so we played it off and continued watching tv. Well... 5 minutes later we hear this crazy carnival music coming from his room, I of course jump and creep down the hall to his room, peer in to see a jazz toy he has which stands on four legs lit up playing the music we have never heard it play before. Just as I peered in, it stopped. My wife was behind me in the doorway at this point so I walked in, got on my hands and knees to look at his toy to see if there was nay reason as to why it had gone off or to see if what we thought fell could have caused it. Nothing had fallen and just as I got on my hands and knees to look at the toy, it went off again in my face. I checked the toy out, nothing visibly wrong. We had actually just replaced the batteries a couple weeks prior. We also have a cd player which plays classical music for him in his room which after we left the room, decided to up its volume so much as to overcome the sound of the tv we were watching in the living room.

Two nights after that incident I came home and jokingly asked my wife if the ghosts were any bother to her while I was at work to which she responded with a NO. After ditting down I noticed a sound coming from the back of the house. I asked my wife if she had the humidifier in one of the kids room or what was left running. She said she didn't have anything running. I walked down the hall to investigate, opened the bathroom door down the hall and right before my eyes, the water was turned on full blast. I of course was a little ticked off because of the A.) the water bill! B.) we're in a drought and what a waste! To this, she got a little weirded out. She told me that she had been back there after the kids were put to bed no more than a couple hours prior and it was not on, nor did she even touch the sink.

So that is my story. I have spoken with (white buffalo) via e-mail about the situation and she thinks there are 3 beings in my home. Any other feed back?

Flashing Light,"Illinois, United States",Orbs / Lights / Mists,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Orbs / Lights / Mists :: Flashing Light

M y sister just moved into a new home, and I keep seeing this bright light. More of like a flashing star like object. I awoke and it was outside my niece's room in the middle of the hall way close to the ceiling, I figured maybe it's the smoke alarm, so I just watched and watched. For a while nothing. Then it would come quick.

The next morning, I went to see if a smoke alarm was there, and there wasn't. Just last night 01/20/2008, I awoke and went and sat on the couch in the dark. I seen this light again. Before I had seen it upstairs outside my niece Marissa's room. Now I was seeing it sort of in the same place but downstairs in the middle of the ceiling between the doors of one room and the other room. It was so bright and then flashed dimly. So I turned on the t.v. and waited. Well the tv was on and I was still seeing this mysterious light. Like a sparkle or something. Too fast to take a picture of. As if you had a big diamond ring on and you were to move your hand left and right slowly and how they shine quickly. But I was in pitch black both times, and I wear no jewelry.

I really don't know what it is, and even when I'm not looking at that spot I can see it flash in the corner of my eye. It will not move, it just stays in that same spot no matter what.

Earthbound in my Home,"North Carolina, United States",Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: Earthbound in my Home

T his experience happened while I was still living at home with my father. We were in this house from 1997 - 2001. Things started off fine, we were both comfortable in the house. Things started happening very slowly but picked up a very fast pace. It all started when I would be home alone, downstairs watching tv when I would hear the side door close and foot steps walking from the kitchen down the hall to my dads room. Thinking that maybe my dad had come home from lunch, I would mosey upstairs to greet him only to find the driveway vacant of any car and no one in the house.

I will also mention that my sister was living with my mom at the time and would spend Wed nights and every other weekend with my dad. We both had our own room. After the whole foot step thing started taking place my dad would make a random comment to me like, ""thanks for making your sisters bed..."" To which I would tell him that I never did make it. My sister is a slob and would leave for school not even touching her room.

On other occasions my dad would ask what I was doing in my sisters room because the sheets would be pulled back. Heck, why would I be in there when I had my own room?

Here is where it starts to get even more interesting... My dad works for a big company and sometimes has to travel out of state. Well, this time he was about to head to California for a week. To my surprise, he allowed me to stay at the house alone (I was 16 or 17). While my dad was gone, things started to get very weird. My buddy from up the street would stay at my place because we would often get in late.

One night during that week, we were sitting at the table talking before heading to a friends when he seemed transfixed on something. I asked him what he was looking at and he said that he kept seeing two balls of light whirling around the kitchen then shoot into the wall (orbs). We decided to head out after that.

Well, upon returning home a few hours later, pulling into the driveway we both froze and looked at each other. Every light was on in the house as well as every ceiling fan.

Jumping forward to the end of that week home alone. My dad gets home and asks me why I was in his room while he gone. I hadn't been and honestly, I thought he would have locked his door since it was shut and I had no reason to even go in there. The reason why he asked me this was because he had bought a pair of shoes and hadn't even taken them out of the box, just threw 'em in his closet. When he got home and went to his room, the shoes were not only out of the box but were laced up at the foot of his bed.

One day I was up the street at my friends and we got to talking about all of this in front of his mom and their elderly neighbor who often came over. Well, this woman who had lived in the neighborhood told me reluctantly that a few years back, a family living their which was comprised of a woman, her husband and daughter lived there. Apparently the woman had some mental issues. One day the father came home from work (this next part is graphic) to find his wife in the closet, with a dry cleaning bag wrapped around her head. She was dead when he arrived there.

I was of course a bit freaked by this news but figured as much that this was the explanation as to what was going on in the house. Never once did I feel threatened in the house except for twice.

One night I was laying in bed watching tv when all of a sudden there was this banging sound. It started on my dresser and made its way all the way around the room and stopped by my head. At that point, right in my ear, a deep animalistic breathing, almost growling sound started happening. I said a prayer and asked to be protected by the white light and it stopped.

This happened once more downstairs while I was at the computer. That deep animalistic breathing sound coming from outside the comp room in the basement. I was using AOL Instant Messenger talking to my friend up the road. I told him what had just happened on there because I was so freaked. Then it happened again! Right behind my head. At that point I jumped up, ran upstairs, out the door and straight to my buddies.

When I got there he opened the door with a puzzled look on his face. He asked me how I had gotten to his house so fast after just typing to him. He showed me the instant message that read from me, ""nah man, I'm just messing with you, everything's cool..."" I never typed that! That is my story. There are definitely more to follow. Thanks for your time.

Knock! Knock! Whos's There? 2,Philippines,Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: Knock! Knock! Whos's There? 2

W hat I am about to tell you happened in one day. It was in 1994 and I was in my 4th year in college. In that year, I am already living with my late grandparent's house. There was only two of us staying in the old house, the male helper and myself. Of course when it's weekends I spend most of my day in my girlfriend's house. I always go home in the middle of the night, sometimes much later. But one saturday night, I went home like 11:45pm because I need to watch late news for my thesis. I have with me a voice recorder and was recording the news.

After sometime, I heard knocks at my door. I thought it was the helper who was knocking just to check if I am already home or sometimes just to tell me that I have phone calls from my parents who are staying in Tarlac. I answered, ""narito na ako, naikandado ko na mga pinto..."" (I am already here, I have locked all the doors in the house.) But nobody acknowledged my response, so I just kept on doing the recording. After a moment there was a knock at my door again. So I asked this time if there was a call from my parents. But nobody was answering. I told to myself that the next time he will knock again I will immediately open the door. And so it happened. This time the knockings was a little louder. So what I did was the moment I heard the knockings I jumped off to my bed and grab the doorknob.

As I opened the door there was no one outside my room. The long hallway going to the dinning area was empty and dark. I called on to our helper as I was heading to his quarter just beside the dinning area. As I got to his place, I called on him once again and there he was just waking up from my call. I asked him if he was the one knocking my door but he said that he just woke up. Truly, he just woke up because if he was the one making a fool of me, he couldn't get back that fast to his bed and get inside to his ""kolambo""(mosquito net). When I got to his quarter, he was just waking and the kolambo was still neatly tucked in his bed mat. That is so mind boggling.

Annoyed, he asked me why I had aroused him from his sleep. I told him the story but does not want to believe because we were only two of us in the old house. Until I realized that I was still holding the voice recorder and played back what I have recorded. There it was he heard it crisp and clear. So, he grab a bolo and went around the house looking for some burglars that might have come in. I was just by the dinning area looking at him while he was doing a search. As he came back he told me that all the windows and doors were shut and there was no way someone could enter from the outside. That was the time he got afraid and told me what has happened to him that mid noon of the same day.

He said that while alone watching SST (a show hosted by Randy Santiago) beside the long dinning table, he saw one tablespoon swinging by itself. During that time, set of spoons, forks and cutleries were hanged in a carousel-like hangers. He said, that the weird thing about it was that only one tablespoon was swinging and the other utensils were just hanging. There was no wind coming from outside and he was all alone at that time. He said that he didn't mind what was happening and kept on watching the show. This time the spoon fell from the the hanger and it was still swinging until it fell to the floor. At that instance he got pretty scared, took the spoon from the floor, turned off the TV and went out towards the garden. I got so scared that night that I asked him to sleep inside my room.

I noticed that whenever the ghost in our house would let itself be felt, it would choose the moments that you are not scared or your mind was not thinking of scary stuffs.

There were lots of stories behind our old house. Stories we hear from our neighbors. I think that the ghost in our house has good intentions or just guarding our house. We lived in a not so good neighborhood. You know, were you will hear that some other house has been burglarized or victimized by ""akyat-bahay"". But since then until now, our house has been burglar-free. Nobody seems to dare to bust in our house especially at night. Even our own neighbors has been seeing white lady roaming our garden during the night, or sometimes coming down from the balcony stairs.

I realized that the ghost in our house, whoever it was is our house guardian and is giving luck to the house and it's inhabitant. To our resident ghost/ghosts, thank you for keeping us safe. And thanks to God who are always loving and caring.

College Imprint in Time,"Missouri, United States",Apparitions / Voices / Touches,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Apparitions / Voices / Touches :: College Imprint in Time

I live in a large fraternity house on our school's campus and next to it is this concrete walkway which connects the school's apartments and dorms and leads to all of the university buildings. This walkway is located about 75 yards up a hill from our house. It's heavily used, a lot of people walk on it, you know big deal, it's a concrete walkway. If you're walking perpendicular to the walkway, you can continue walking uphill for another 50 feet or so on a path that leads to a gas station.

During opening week of school this year I was walking up the hill to the gas station. As I reached the top, I noticed out of the corner of my eye three people walking on the sidewalk. They weren't there though. Imagine you're almost positive that you saw something but when you look directly at it, it isn't there.

Well here's where it gets weird... When I saw these people walking on the sidewalk, they appeared to me in flashes, like say if someone lit up a dark room with a strobe light only for a microsecond, and everything that it lit up was in black and white. There were three people and three 'flashes' and in each progressive flash the people moved about the walkway. Two of them were walking towards the tunnel that lead to the dorms to my right and the other one was walking towards campus to my left. They were wearing attire that looked to be from the forties and didn't seem to notice that I was there. The two that were walking to the right were a girl, which I didn't make out clearly and a guy wearing a letter jacket. They weren't holding hands, but had their arms locked the way that people did sometimes back then. The other girl was walking alone and had long curly/wavy hair that was flowing behind her, almost as though it was blowing in the wind.

In the first two 'flashes' they were walking in opposite directions yet in the third flash, the single girl had whipped around and was staring at the couple. The look on her face gave me the sense that the guy had broken up with her and was now walking around arms locked with some other girl.

Now I said this is where it gets weird earlier, but this is where it really gets weird. My buddy Alex Hopkins claims to have seen the exact same thing. It's weird because we were standing in different places and it was at different times, yet the people were in the same place in the same spot. Alex was standing a little bit further down the sidewalk and viewed the same thing.

When I told him what I saw, he was like ""I wish you didn't say that, because I saw the exact same thing..."" It's funny because we had both completely disregarded it. He went into detail about what he had seen versus what I had seen. Some of the minor details didn't match up. We couldn't agree on which direction the couple was walking... To or from the tunnel and I distinctly recalled the single girl's hair being blonde even though Alex told me what he saw was in black and white.

I think its more worthwhile to call into point the things we did agree on, like where we saw them walking, what they looked like, how many 'flashes' there were, their attire, and the look on the single girl's face. It's funny sometimes, the things we think we might have seen but aren't exactly sure of. I generally don't like to speak of some of the weird things I see sometimes, but I think I can feel a lot more at ease when someone else tells me the exact same story.

A Premonition of Death,"Washington, United States",Psychic / Medium,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Psychic / Medium :: A Premonition of Death

I have a long history of seeing a black apparition prior to someone's death, but I had never seen this figure prior to the death of someone close to me, until this instance.

Arriving to work one Friday morning, having just parked my car, I was busy gathering my belongings when I looked up and saw a dark apparition manifest directly in front of my vehicle. I could make out the gender and some facial details of this transparent being. Struck with fear, I could not look directly at it. I turned away not believing what I was seeing. I had never seen this figure at such a close distance. My heart raced as my mind searched for an explanation. When I got the nerve to look up, it was gone.

Knowing that I had previously seen this figure prior to someone's death, I tried to determine who it was that was about to die. My oldest brother Lou and his family were in town visiting, so I immediately jumped to the conclusion that it was he that would die.

On Saturday, I received a call from by my parents inviting me to have brunch with my brother's family prior to their departure the following day. Fearing that this would be my last opportunity to spend time with my oldest brother I agreed to join them.

On Sunday, I received a call from my best friend Dave, asking me to join him in testing his son's go-kart that he just received from the shop. He wanted to test it before allowing his son drive it. I explained to him that my brother was in town and that I had made some prior commitments. I promised that I would call him immediately afterward.

Upon arriving home after having brunch with my brother and his family, my wife explained that Dave had been in an accident and told me that Dave's wife wanted me to call as soon as I got home. My heart dropped and I feared the worst.

When I called Dave's wife, she explained that Dave had been in a horrible accident and feared that he would not survive. I raced to the hospital not believing what was happening. We waited at the hospital until late that night, only to hear that my best friend had passed away.

I wonder if I could have prevented Dave's accident if I would have guessed that he would be the one to pass away and not my brother?

The Cold Middle Room,"Kansas, United States",Old Hags / Night Attacks / Sleep Paralysis,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Old Hags / Night Attacks / Sleep Paralysis :: The Cold Middle Room

I moved to a small town at the age of 15. My mother had remarried to a very great man. Relocating in the middle of my sophomore year in high school was traumatic to say the least. A new town, new school, new job and the dreaded new ""house"", at 411 Clarke Street. Mind you, I lived in very small house, before moving into a two story brick house. This was ""great"" I thought, I finally got to have my own bedroom.

I picked the center bedroom upstairs between my sister's room to the right and my parent's bedroom to the left. My brother slept downstairs. We moved into this house in the middle of December in 1983. A large two story brick house, with four bedrooms, a living room, kitchen and 1 1/2 baths and basement.

When you walked in the front door you entered into the largest room in the house, the living room. At the south end of the living room was a closet, for storage. Although at this time of the year it was extremely cold outside, this closet was the coldest room in this house. This room remained freezing cold all year long. This type of cold, was a bone chilling, cold. I can still feel the sensation from that room after moving out over 20 years ago.

I remember my room, with plain tan paneled walls, and a single window and closet that connected mine and my sister's rooms together. Boring for the most. My bedroom was located upstairs, in the center of the house.

It was the summer of 1984, I had a black and white T.V., I can remember it was a Friday night, I had stayed home. Many of the kid's in our hometown always partied on the weekends. I chose to stay home this particular weekend. I can remember this quite vividly, because my Mom would get after me to ""quit sleeping all the time"" and ""go out and do something""!

I had fallen asleep with the light off in my room, watching MTV. I remember the light from the T.V., was quite bright as my room was the smallest bedroom in the house. The video playing on the T.V., was ""Sister Christian"" by NIGHTRANGER. I was awoken for some unknown reason. At this time I remember opening my eyes. I could not breathe, I could not move. Looming over my bed was the darkest, most massive, black unknown form, I ever encountered. I remember the air in the room was like a vacuum, there wasn't any air. I could not catch my breath. My body felt like it was strapped down on this bed. I knew at this time that I needed to move and, move fast.

I made myself set up in bed. I turned to the right setting on the edge of the bed, and began to have projectile vomiting of something red. Mind you, I had not had anything to eat, or drink that day before going bed, that had any type of red food coloring in it.

By this time, I was screaming and my MOM had ran in the room just ""freaking out"", wandering what was wrong with me. So, I had tried to explain my story to her. ""This woman"", if you can believe it, discounted my story and accused me of sneaking out of the house and going out to get drunk with my friend's.

Much to her dismay I had not left the house. My Sister was a witness for me on this, as she had been out that Friday night. I never slept in that room again. I moved to the bedroom downstairs the next day. I never even entered that room again. I graduated in 1986 and moved away.

Many strange occurrences continued to happen inside this home until I moved away in 1986. The house still remains there, although it has deteriorated some. Many stories from different people who weren't even born at that time, continue to come from this house.

I have moved back to the area and, my local beauty salon is next door. Each time I go to have my hair cut, I always look up to that bedroom window.

My beautician has told me a disturbing fact. When the town was founded, the local cemetery once existed where these houses now stand. The cemetery has since been excavated and all graves relocated outside of town. My old house and, my beauticians house set right in this general location.

My Sons Experience It Too,Canada,Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: My Sons Experience It Too

I have written a few stories about things that go on in my house. Lots of little experiences. Things don't only happen to me, my kids have seen and heard things as well. These things happened over the past summer, 07. I'd like to relate some of oldest son's experiences first. I'll tell you a little bit about him.

He has psychic abilities, it's the only way I can think to put it. He just rolls with it, he hasn't tried to develop it, it just comes out unexpectedly. This is something that we've experienced since he was able to talk, before that, only he knows, I guess. It happens so often that over these 16 years of his life we've totally dismissed coincidence. We would have to be blind not to. Well, the only relationship that has to this story is that I think it's why he has experienced more than my younger son.

Ben is always hearing things, when he does it's very specific and very clear. He relates his experiences with great detail. One night he was the only one still up, using the computer. He heard footsteps heading from the living room, through the kitchen and stop in the dining room. Thinking it was me, he went to see what I was doing out of bed. No one was there, everyone was still in bed. This is the exact reverse route of footsteps I have heard before. Ben's used to hearing and seeing things so he's pretty casual about things like that. He went back to the computer and our old cat, Willy, followed him into the room, sat down in front of the book shelf and proceeded to stare at the upper row of books. His eyes were fixed on one spot about 5 1/2 feet up off of the floor. Ben called his name 4 or 5 times but it was like Willy didn't want to look away. Ben said he knew he heard him, he did the little one ear twitch when he said his name. Finally he came over to Ben and up in his lap.

The exact experience happened to him on another night when he was up late watching T.V., the cat wasn't around for that one though.

My youngest son, McKenzie, doesn't hear the footsteps. He's had different experiences from Ben, more visual than auditory. Ben's second experience, while watching T.V., and these 3 I will tell of McKenzie's all happened within a matter of days. McKenzie woke up one morning after a night of vivid dreams (he has very detailed dreams), to find that he had a different blanket over him than the one he went to sleep with. My first thought was that he'd switched them in his sleep, although he's not known to sleepwalk or wake through the night. He enjoys his sleep, that one.

I wouldn't have given it much thought except 2 mornings later he woke up with 2 character pillows (the cats usually sleep on them) up on his bed. Since they are cat pillows that isn't something he would do. We weren't even sure they were in the bedroom to begin with. The following morning, when he woke up, his alarm clock was perched on the very edge of his bed, near his feet. He said it was so close to the edge that he couldn't believe it hadn't fallen off.

Both of them have seen doorknobs turn and heard the knob for the room off of the basement rattling. They've also heard footsteps upstairs when no one else is home. These things have happened when they've been together.

I have 2 specific experiences of my own that I might as well add. This is getting a bit long but they are similar to the others. In July, the boys were sleeping downstairs. McKenzie had a friend spending the night. The next morning I was up early, making coffee, and I heard someone coming up the basement stairs. After a minute I didn't hear anything else, (I was expecting bathroom sounds), so I went all around the main floor looking for somebody. There wasn't anyone else up yet.

One morning, just after the school year started, everyone was shipped off for the day and I was in the kitchen tidying up. I heard the computer keyboard clicking away, but I was the only one home. When I came to have a look, Windows was just at the log in screen and I didn't see anything out of place.

There may be explanations for some of these things but with the similarities and regularity of the things we've experienced, it seems too coincidental. The little things that go on, that aren't even worth mentioning, happen on a regular basis and often. We've gotten so used to the way things are that sometimes we hardly even give it any thought. It's just the way it is around here.

Nothing scary, just little everyday occurrences. My reminders that there's always someone around to keep me company.

Ghost Pets and Family,Canada,Pets / Animals,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Pets / Animals :: Ghost Pets and Family

J ust recently, I had to put my cat six to sleep, she was a beautiful Himalayan, but she was really old, and since I took her to the vet I was told I had to get her put down. It is so heart wrenching of a decision, she's dying anyways so it is to end her pain. After, I be at home, and I would still see her like she never left, moving around and to me she was telling me goodbye again. Now I barely see her, I think she moved on after letting me knows she's ok and I did the right thing.

I also was visited by her in my dreams and asking my late father to take good care of her. Another instance, few years ago, I have the same experience with my mom's dog too, it was my favourite dog. He was put to sleep to due to being old, and when I visit my mom, I see him under the table and such other spots he likes to be in. I am happy that I can still see them, mostly in dreams. I think that I see them because they want to let me know they are well on the other side.

Five years ago I lost my dad to a sudden heart attack, it hurt and I never got to say goodbye. So I went to the mall in that same year, and I swore that a guy walking down the stairs looked totally like my dad! I wanted to run out and hold him, but realizing that I don't want to make a fool of myself. Though it made me happy to ""see"" him in someone!

Little Boy Haunting my House,"New York, United States",Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: Little Boy Haunting my House

I suppose as a child, I never liked thrillers. I wasn't interested in ghost stories, and I wasn't interested in the paranormal. I grew up for the first 9 years of my life in a small trailer with my parents and siblings. We didn't have cable, so I rarely watched television. I also was not an avid reader, so I knew practically nothing about ghosts, or even what they were, really.

When I turned 12, we had been living in our new home for about 4 years. It was a new house, beautiful, and I adored it. I had also been getting strange feelings around the house, and it got to the point where I was scared to sleep with my door shut.  It would be little things - such as when I was on the computer, I would feel as if someone was hovering over my shoulder watching me. Or, I would be out playing on the swing set with my sister and I would think she was saying something, but she wasn't.

By the time I was 13, I had begun to see something like a child sitting in the corner of my bedroom. My friends would get freaked out, and one time my friend went home without even staying the night. I was beyond confused, and I had no idea what was happening.

A few months before my 14th birthday, I was down in our basement watching TV. Now, my basement isn't one of those creepy basements with all the weird feelings or anything. My basement is, well, just a basement. I began to get a strange feeling - almost like someone had touched my arm to get my attention - and when I looked around, I caught a glimpse of a small boy.

I only told my best friend, Alloy, about this. She admitted to me that she already knew about it. I was surprised, and she told me that she'd seen him before, sitting in one of the corners of my room but had thought it was nothing to worry about and she didn't want to scare me. She told me that he was a young boy, with blonde hair. We kept quiet about it for months, only talking to each other about our experience with the little boy we nicknamed ""Sammy"".

On my 14th birthday, however, I realized that something strange was going on. ""Sammy"" began to appear more and more often, always in my room, the basement, or the kitchen. I wasn't really scared, because so far nothing had happened to scare me. I got startled easily, but being startled isn't the same as being frightened.

I had a birthday party at my house that year, and there was a good 25 kids running around. The whole time I had a very strange feeling, and most of the party was spent in the living room. Alloy told me at one point during the party that she couldn't find one of the girls that had came.

Reluctantly, I left the living room to search around for her. I didn't want to leave everyone because I felt like a rude host. When I found the girl coming down the stairs, however, she had a large grin on her face and seemed completely at ease. The weird feeling left.

Several months later, I was at a slumber party with Alloy, the girl, and our friend Rae. We were all lounging around on the floor, sharing stories. At one point I complained about my sister, and mentioned how I was glad that I only had one brother and two sisters.

The girl, I'll call her Bee, looked startled, and inquired on if I had another brother. Alloy and I had exchanged looks, and told her no, the only brother I had was a year younger. Bee had gone pale, and frantically asked, ""Are you sure? You don't have a little brother?"" By now, Alloy and I had begun to fit the pieces together, and Alloy asked her to describe the boy.

Bee told us that he looked about 7 or 8, with blonde hair a shade darker than mine, with blue eyes that matched mine exactly. She told us he was in a pair of old overalls, and she had been talking to him during our party. Alloy and I remained quiet, and Rae looked confused. Rae told her, ""No, she doesn't have any little brother that age..."" Bee looked confused enough to cry, and I'd asked her what she talked to him about.

Bee told us that she had gone upstairs to use the bathroom, and on her way back downstairs, the little boy was sitting on the steps, watching her. She had sat beside him, and asked him how he was. He had smiled at her, and they both talked about his dinosaur toy, and that he was really happy that day. Bee has asked him if he was happy that it was my birthday, and he'd told her yes.

Bee had left to go get a drink when she walked by me, and wound up staying with the rest of us in the living room the entire time, and didn't see the boy again. She had assumed my father had put him to bed.

When Bee finished telling us about the little boy, Alloy and I told her about ""Sammy"" and that there was a possibility that she had come into contact with him.

Years later, I still catch glimpses of him around our house, but nothing to the extent where I can fully see him like Bee has. Alloy has seen him a couple times, but I normally only see him when I'm very depressed, or I call out for him.

All in all, I'm curious about why ""Sammy"" is hanging around our house. He doesn't seem to wish harm to anyone (besides one incident that happened last spring) so I can't help but wonder why he hasn't moved on.

In the Attic,"Alabama, United States",Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: In the Attic

W hen I was smaller, the attic to my house was used for storage and nothing special, really. I never went up there, hence there was no AC up there, nor a heater. But in the summer or 2005, my attic was redone, and now it is play a room for my sister and I. There are 2 TVs up there, a couch, and one window. There are also 2 closet doors for storage. They stay cold, dark, and dank all year round.

It all started in the attic when I turned off my video game, and the TV started thumping from inside, sounding like a heartbeat. (This still goes on, mind you.) and I just blew this off, and thought nothing of it.

The only next thing that really awakened me was my friend Kim and I were in one of the closets. We just opened the door, and turned on the light; soon after, we were standing on opposite sides of the closet space. We were standing still, and a picture slid off the box it was sitting on and onto the floor, with a loud thump. There were no drafts, no way Kim or me could've made that box or picture settle.

Soon after this, nothing went on for a while. But, one night as I was sitting up on my couch in the living room, I heard what sounded like footsteps running along my furnace in the hallway. I got up, went to walk down the hallway only to find nothing wrong. I turned around and headed for the living room again; however, when I was completely turned around, the attic door slammed and settled. The window was not open, because I rushed up there to check. I saw nothing.

There have been no other particular things going on besides this. And, this house is only 15 years old, built by my stepfather himself. The only other weird encounter I recall is being three years old in my parent's bed, seeing some kind of freaky animal crawling in my hallway, heading towards me. My parents say I was scared that night and that they had to slip the lights on 3 times before I would sleep.

Took More than Bargained For,"North Carolina, United States",Ouija Board / Seances,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Ouija Board / Seances :: Took More than Bargained For

T his story I feel might somewhat tie into the previous story that I posted which told of an experience while living with my father. There was old abandoned house almost right across the street from ours. You could tell that it had been involved in a fire at one point. Being young teenagers with nothing better to do, my friend from up the street and I would go over there and climb up in to the house. Everything was still in the place, like somebody had just up and left. We would walk through the house (dumb because it was listed condemned) none-the-less we would look through things. There were boxes of really interesting books and literature. This was not smart I know, but I took a few boxes home with me. I went through some of the boxes and forgot about them for a little while. In the meantime, the house was leveled and set for redevelopment.

After a few months my friend and I were bored and came across the boxes that I had taken form the house. In one of the boxes we discovered a mans birth and death certificate along with other achievements such as his pilots license and other family heirlooms. We both looked at each other and both pretty much said the same thing, ""oh crap!"" We knew at this point about the woman who had committed suicide in the home prior to us moving in but after discovering the objects in the box we thought that maybe this man was in my house too!

I was going to take the boxes back and burry them in the ground where the house had stood but before I could, my dad made a dump run one day and had taken all the boxes with him and chucked them.

Every time we would walk by that lot there was a very very noticeable drop in temp. Again being dumb we took a Ouija board to the lot to try and communicate with the man to apologize. (I would never ever use one now because I know the dangers) So, myself, my buddy from up the road and his brother, tried to contact him. We had a candle burning in a long cylinder glass next to us. While talking with the Ouija we kept getting the messages 'GO DIE' 'DIE ON THE SABBATH'. When we asked its name, it kept saying VEC and VOR. Then all of a sudden the flame from the candle which originally was a good 5 inches down into the glass shot up about 2 or 3 inches out of the glass.

We decided to call it quits at that point but before we left the lot my friends brother was asking me what the guy looked like and began describing what he said there was a man in the tree watching us with pure hatred in his eyes. He described to me the man that I had seen in the boxes from the property. He had not seen the pictures. We definitely booked it out of there quick!

To this day I don't know if it was the woman haunting my house or if I allowed the man in or if either one were to blame?

Stories that May Have a Deeper Meaning,"Florida, United States",Misc,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Misc :: Stories that May Have a Deeper Meaning

I 'm not saying my house is haunted. Because that would (most likely) be false. But I can put my finger on some weird things that have happened. My Dad has also only had one ""ghostly"" experience. Weird, too, because he is 53 and has had all the chances in the world to have a paranormal experience.

For example, when he was in the Army in Texas, he was out in the dessert, at night, where you could see anything in the sky. He never once saw a UFO. It was the perfect setting, too. But when he was 12 and he lived in Long Island, he and some friends went to a friend's house and played ball. Then they went inside, and headed down for the basement. They were the only ones there. When they reached the door to the basement, they heard a screeching sound of aluminum on the floor. They ran back up the stairs as fast as they could. They looked through the basement window (outside) and saw the chair had moved all the way across the room. When the parents came home, they took them down to the basement to show them the chair had moved. But guess what? The chair was back where it was in the first place. Nobody believed them.

My Mom's friend's birthday was recently. When she lived in Akron, Ohio, they were supposed to move to California, get married, and live together. But he left without her and got back together with his ex-wife. My Mom was upset, and never answered his phone calls.

One day, she decided to call him. Unfortunately, she found out he had died a couple years earlier. She was devastated. Around the time of his birthday, she found feathers around the house. We never find feathers around the house. And we have no pet birds. She also found coins. Ok, so maybe it was a coincidence? Well not exactly...

One morning she woke up to make coffee, and was about to take the cup out of the dishwasher, when she saw a penny. The cup was turned over, and the penny was sitting on the bottom of the cup. Explain that, please. Who would put a penny on a coffee cup? My Mom doesn't do it, she's busy all the time. My Dad is at work all day, and goes to bed early. My sister is literally, never home. And I didn't do it.

Lastly, I want to tell a story about my sister. She was about 14 or 13 when this happened. She had just started doing her own laundry. Keep in mind, she does not have a job, and my parents would not secretly do this to her. Like I said, they are busy. Every time my sister would do her laundry, she would find money in her pockets. Lots of money. I thought maybe she kept putting the same money in her pockets, and thinking she had found more. But that wasn't the case.

After awhile though, the money stopped coming. I don't know what happened after that.

I probably have more stories... I just cannot recall them right now. But when I remember them, I'll post them :)

Cellar Creeps,"New York, United States",Poltergeists / Physical Manifestations,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Poltergeists / Physical Manifestations :: Cellar Creeps

I live with my boyfriend at his parents house in new york. About a month ago a couple days before christmas my boyfriend and I were in our room watching t.v. His parents were asleep and his uncle who lives with us has his room down in the cellar. It was about two in the morning and my boyfriends uncle came and knocked on our bedroom door, when my boyfriend opened the door, his uncle told him he needed to talk to him so they went into the living room.

His uncle told him that he though my boyfriend was playing a joke on him because he heard something tapping on his door and then his room got really cold and all of a sudden his door burst open like someone kicked it. The cellar was pitch black so he could not see anything, he called out to see if my boyfriend was out there. Once he did that something started growling at him from the dark and it kept getting closer and closer. So he got scared and started to walk up the cellar stairs when between the cellar stairs something that looked like a man went walking across the cellar and into the wall.

After he found out it was not my boyfriend he freaked out. So my boyfriend decided to go downstairs with him to see what it could be. When he walked down the stairs his hair on his body stood up and he could see his breath, he felt like there was something in the cellar but could not see anything.

The next night we were all in the kitchen just talking and playing texas hold em when the garbage can picked up and got thrown across the room right in front of us. Then we heard all this crashing noise down in the cellar and the sound of someone running up the cellar stairs. There were things all over the basement knocked down and across the room and it was freezing cold again.

The whole family, including me, has been depressed and we feel like there is something negative in this house. We feel like we are constantly being watched the side door that goes into the garage opens and slams by itself.

I went in the cellar to do laundry one day and kept feeling like someone was standing behind me. Then about a week ago on 1/14/08 I awoke at about 5 am to the sound of someone banging on the walls outside my bedroom door down the hall way, when I opened the door nothing was there and everyone else was still asleep. I keep feeling like something bad is going to happen soon I will not even go into the cellar by myself anymore.

Please if you have any ideas on what to do to get rid of this presence please let me know. Thank you

Basement  Apartment,"Michigan, United States",Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: Basement  Apartment

T he early years of my marriage to my husband Jim we were looking for an apartment that was cheap and close to his work. This was 1971 in Ypsilanti. In the paper we found one that all he had to do was walk across the yard down the field and over the railroad track and he would be at work. The rent is what we liked the best, it was cheap.

We went to see the apartment. It was in the basement of an elderly ladies home. She took us down many steps to the basement and to the left of us was a door she unlocked and we all went in. The kitchen was small and the living room and the bedroom were actually one only with a curtain drawn across from wall to wall to have a bedroom there. In the apartment was two small windows and the whole apartment was not very big and it was quite dark even with the few lights on in there.

I asked where the bathroom was, she took us out of the door to the apartment down this long very dim hallway. To the right of us was another curtain and behind that was a shower stall, then went to another room with a curtain and that was the toilet and the small sink.

Across from the toilet was a door in which she took us in there and it was the utility room where she had a washer and dryer in there and many shelves and some big barrows sitting next to the washer. She told us we could wash our clothes and dry them or hang them up on the line that was hanging there as long as we kept the room clean. I told my husband that room was cold feeling to me, he said that was because it was the basement.

My husband looked at me and said ""We will take the apartment"". So the next day we packed up our things from our other apartment and took to our new apartment. We got all our things to the new apartment and then my husband, who worked the second shift, had to get ready for work. I told him I would have plenty to do unpacking and putting things away.

For days I would put our things away and we got a lamp for the living room so there would be more light in the apartment as it was to dim for me, that seemed to brighten up all the rooms since the apartment was so small, but we had no children and with the price we could not go wrong. We had no phone while we lived there but our landlady told us we could always come upstairs and use the one she had when we wanted to. We thanked her and went back to our new home in the basement.

One night my husband woke up and woke me up and asked if I heard that noise coming from the utility room? I said ""no what you talking about?"" He said it sounded like something being dragged across the floor. I said no I didn't hear anything. We stayed awake for a little while and nothing so fell back to sleep.

About a week later one night, I was not feeling well, so went to sleep, pulled the curtain back to let in the heat. I was woke up by a noise, I rolled over to look at the clock it was nearly 3am, it was long past time for my husband to be home. He was a drunk so I figured he was out at the bars. Maybe it was my imagination working that I heard something as I was very tired. I stayed awake waiting for my husband to come home and listening to all sorts of noises. I prayed a lot to the Lord to protect me until my man came home.

Some sounded like dragging, some sounded like banging on the wall next to the head of the bed. I got out of the bed and sat on the sofa pulled the curtain close. I wanted to go upstairs to use the phone, but to frightened to open the door. So I pulled a chair up under the door knob to keep what ever was out there in the hallway and the other room from getting in. I stayed awake until my husband, who was drunk, came in around 4am.

When he banged up against the door, my heart went so fast I could hardly breathe, then I heard him say ""Let me in"" I went and removed the chair and flung myself into his arms shaking. He didn't notice, he went to bed and I was next to him after the door was locked and the chair under the knob.

The next day we had a talk he said to me ""I told you something woke me up one night, now you will listen to what I say right?"" I said yes. We looked into the room where the washer and dryer was in the morning and didn't see anything out of place, no scratch marks on the floor, nothing was out of order in that room. We checked the bathroom and the shower room nothing out of order.

One night I was so cold and so frightened I had to go to the bathroom at the other end of the hallway, I held it as long as I could then I finally just had to open the door and go down the long dim hallway to the toilet. Did my business not wanting to look into the laundry room. I hurried back to my apartment and locked the door. I felt like something was watching me while I was in the bathroom.

Everything seem to calm down and so did we. My husband went to bed early, being drunk and all and I had to go to the bathroom and take a shower. I did the shower first and then went to the toilet, the laundry room door was open and the curtain to the toilet was open a bit. As I sat on the toilet and looked into that room my heart nearly stopped. I could see what appeared to be a man hanging from the neck in the laundry room just swinging around limp. I got off that toilet, went to the apartment shaking, too afraid to stay their flung open the door ran up the stairs and outside.

Our landlady came out wanting to know what all the noise was from, I told her that the basement was haunted, she laughed at me. Then she told me this story.

Her husband was a drunk, he spent a lot of time in the basement being drunk as she would not let him be upstairs. I asked if he slept in the little apartment when he was drunk? She said he might have, she did not chase after him. She said one day she went away and came back, had to do some laundry and went down stairs to find he hung himself in the laundry room and yes, I would be able to see the area where he hung himself when I was sitting on the toilet.

I asked her with a shaky voice. ""What did he stand on to do this with?"" She told me she found one of those old barrows that was next to the washer rolled over near him and so figured he use that to stand on. I told her of all the noises I heard since we lived there. The dragging, banging and like gasping. She told me she has heard all that too when she has been in the basement. I told her I seen him hanging there, he looked human form to me. She said she has seen him down there too and she just tells him to behave himself and goes on with her work. She told me he would not hurt me, he was dead. I told her I was not going to live in a place like this no more.

My husband and I had to live there for a little longer. The tv went out and the only thing I had that would make noise so I could not hear what was going on in the other room was the radio, which I played loud to drown out the other noises. One day I called my Mom and asked if we could stay with them upstairs and pay them the rent we paid here. She asked why and I told her and we moved out of the small apartment and we went to my Mom and Dads home.

Sometime after that I went back to talk to the landlady and asked her why she didn't tell us about that before we took the apartment. She said she should have but she needed the money and if she would have said anything no one would rent it. I never went back after that.

Whispers and Tall Shadows,South Africa,Apparitions / Voices / Touches,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Apparitions / Voices / Touches :: Whispers and Tall Shadows

I n my 30 years of life I have had various encounters with the paranormal. Some of them, however, are truly memorable. One story that comes to mind is the one I will relate to you now.

It was early in the 1990s when we moved into a double-storey block of flats in the mid-city area of Benoni. It was my second year of high school, and my best friend at that time lived in the same block, a floor below us.

It was during the school holidays that my parents decided to visit family in another province, but I just wanted to stay at home and enjoy some time with my friends. After much pleading and assurance that I was big enough to look after myself, my parents spoke with my friend's mom, who agreed to keep an eye on me while they were gone.

This particular encounter happened about four nights after my parents had left, and my friend and I were sitting in my bedroom, chatting about things boys our age usually spoke about. What our conversation was about escapes me, but the topic of the paranormal was not one of the things we discussed.

At about 2am my friend said he felt tired and decided it was time to go home.

I walked him to the front door, where we chatted for a few more minutes before he said goodnight and headed for the staircase. I waited until he reached the flight of stairs before I turned around to enter my flat.

At that moment someone whispered my name in my right ear, clear and sharp.

At first I thought that it was my friend, but as I turned to look I realized that he was already going down the last few steps towards his flat. There was nobody else around.

I started getting a bit frightened, but nevertheless tried to rationalize that this was simply the effects of a tired mind combined with an overactive imagination.

As you enter the flat, looking straight ahead would reveal the living room. To the left of the entrance was the kitchen, while to the right a hallway led to the bedrooms and bathrooms. My room light was the only one on that night, so everything was mostly dark when I stepped back inside.

I looked straight at the couch against the far wall. I could clearly see a dark shape sitting there. I could not make out any features. It turned its head towards me, then stood up. I immediately realized that it was much taller than any person I had ever seen. Its head touched the ceiling.

An even greater sense of terror came over me at this stage and I ran into my room, banging the door shut behind me.

At this point in time I knew whatever it was was definitely not friendly. It just felt 'wrong'.

There were two slight taps on my door, then about five seconds later there was a loud bang.

I spent the most of the rest of that night sitting on the edge of my bed, rocking back and forth from sheer terror until I eventually drifted off to sleep.

Just for interest sake, it turned out that my friend did not sleep well that night and he said he had really bad dreams as well.

Luckily the 'visitor' of that night never came again, and nothing strange ever happened in that flat afterwards either.

A few weeks later we decided to find out the history of the flats. We were rather disappointed to learn that the flats themselves were less than twenty years old, and that there were definitely no deaths, violent or otherwise, in our flat. Going further back also showed that the area was all just an open field before the flats were built.

And so this all still remains a mystery. It was undoubtedly the scariest experience of my life.

PS. I've made an observation from reading some of the other stories on this site. I wonder why it is that many spirits seem to want to communicate by either whispering in your ear our shouting at you from a few rooms away.

Disrespectful of the Dead,Greece,Misc,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Misc :: Disrespectful of the Dead

H aving lived most of my life on an island, I had the good fortune of being allowed to play outdoors even after sunset and do things a city-child wouldn't normally dream of. It's this sense of security that small places provide that make even the most protective parents less worried about and, of course, more tolerant towards a child's need for adventure.

For all the above, I spent all my restless childhood searching for buried treasures in the forests and cycling along the endless coasts of my Greek island looking for pirate ships( not that I found any).

And yet, from all my strange experiences, there's one which stands out to this very day, maybe because my blue coat is still hanging in my closet- in a far-away end.

Well, a good story-teller should start from the beginning so...

It was one of those days when a child wakes up feeling so energetic, almost naughty. I jumped out of bed, barely having the patience to have breakfast and ran to my bicycle while my poor mother was trying her best to remind me to be on time for lunch. Ten minutes later, and, having summoned the rest of the pack, we were cycling along the south coast of the harbour without a single plan in mind. We spent most of the morning and afternoon hours racing and teasing one another and then, tired as we were; we ""camped"" outside an old graveyard exchanging ghost stories from the past. Needless to say so much for lunch and our midday nap!

It must have been close to sun-set when Sophia (one of the oldest in the group) began telling a story that had supposedly taken place in that very abandoned graveyard. As the narration progressed, the less comfortable we all felt and every now and then we would turn round to check on the Iron Gate that stood as a barrier between us and the dead! I, personally, had the distinct feeling I was being watched but would hesitate to look closer in fear of ruining the reputation of being fearless!

Finally, the story ended with the dead bride claiming the life of her disloyal groom and my fearless friends having piled up in a corner, completely terrified! I could see Sophia feeling proud for the fright she had caused and, to this very day, I still wonder what came over me to so sarcastically utter ""Right! And then what? She jumped back to the grave with an everlasting smile on her face-one that passer-by wanderers can detect even today?""

That, of course, initiated a whole riot among the pack, and as I should have guessed, Sophia challenged me to go check it out if I dare...

Why, just tell me why one gets to say the wrong thing at the wrong time? And as if that wasn't enough, there goes another suggestion, ""and while you're at it, bring us some proof that you have actually been inside and not hidden behind the bushes or something...""

Right! Now I knew I was in deep trouble but I refused to let Sophia humiliate me and, despite my growing terror, I jumped over the old gate ignoring the chills I was feeling.

I can still hear my friends screaming, Sophia laughing and a voice in my head saying ""don't, don't"" but I walked on until I was far from sight and deep into the creepy wilderness. At that point, despite the foolishness of my youth, I felt awkward, knowing that I was trespassing. In my culture, we were taught to respect the dead and what I was doing was not respectful and yet, I would have rather died than have Sophia calling me a coward.

I recall walking among half-open or broken graves and I was overwhelmed by the feeling of abandonment when, all of a sudden, I detect an open grave-the tombstone was in pieces pilled up on the side of the hole. I stopped, whispered a prayer and tried to find my courage. I must have been there for quite a while because I suddenly realized it was gradually getting darker and darker, so, finally I stretched my arm in the interior until I touched something solid and pulled it out.

It was part of a human pelvis, worn off due to exposure to the sun and rain.

Being a little darker now and having accomplished my mission, I made my way for the gate once again but, to my surprise, everyone was gone but Sophia and Nickie. And they were obviously not happy with my success!

They inspected the bone and then said they would now have to go so they jumped back on their bikes and off they went leaving me baffled.

I was ready to throw the bone to the ground and run back behind them but, having realized I had been enough disrespectful for a day, I jumped back into the graveyard wishing to undo the wrong.

It took me ages to find the open grave again and when I did, I placed the bone back in and, this time in tears, set off for my way home feeling a taste of bitterness in my lips. ""I shouldn't have done that, I should have just kept quiet,"" I thought.

Some time later I reached home and letting the bike fall to the ground (little did I care at that point) I opened our front door and stepped in to face my mother's wrath! There also goes dinner as you would have guessed. The only thing I still clearly remember about the rest of the evening was my mum yelling about me having destroyed my coat, a muddy coat that resembled what I was wearing that same day flashing in front of my eyes, and then, my bedroom door hitting me where the sun don't shine as mum shut it behind me!

I didn't get any sleep that night going over and over the whole day but sometime during the early hours I managed to close my eyes and let go of my worries.

""Have I ever broke into your house and disturbed your sleep? Have I ever misplaced your clothes?"" The angry voice can still be heard in my head as I woke up from that terrible sleep soaking wet! At that, my door opened wide and my mum rushed in to hold me and tell me it had just been a dream. I fell asleep again.

It must have been ten in the morning when mum returned to my room to ask me what had happened to my coat. Thinking she was referring to the previous day I seemed reluctant to explain when I realized she meant that same morning.

""I washed the mud off last night and this morning... It was, I don't know, dusty again. Did you touch it again since last night?""

""No I didn't! But I did something stupid,"" I began saying as I broke into tears and went on to tell her about my little adventure and the disturbing dream I had.

She was unhappy about my revelation but then tried to sound firm while setting down some rules and, finally, reassuring that there was nothing to worry about as long as I did not do that again. That day I stayed indoors, not feeling up to anything.

The next morning though I was in for a rough awakening as mum came rushing into my room accompanied by my grandfather: ""Did you touch the coat at all-we need to know the truth?""

And again I refused to having done such thing when, to my terror grandpa asked me to get up and take him to the old cemetery. I cannot describe my state of mind at that moment but, since they both refused to take no for an answer, I got up, dressed and showed him the way. On our way there he insisted on making sure that the voice in my dream had not told me his name and finally stopped the effort.

All that's left to say is, we were circling the interior of that lonely place attempting to find the opening from where I took the bone and then, the spot where I misplaced it but, to no avail. The whole did was done in the cover of darkness and finally my grandpa decided that the only way to ease the dead was to bring a priest and get him to read a prayer, with me present, of course.

As for the coat, despite my mum's frequent requests to throw it away, you can still find it to this day (twenty-two years later) hanging in the far away corner of my closet under which I have to vacuum every now and then.

The Little Girl Ghost,"Minnesota, United States",Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: The Little Girl Ghost

T he story goes back to 1975 when my family; my mother, brother, sister and brand new niece; moved to a new home in south Minneapolis. We were forced to move for my mothers' health, she required a first floor bedroom.

Shortly after moving in our father, my mom's ex, moved in to help with the bills and built himself a room in the basement. Early on there were some odd occurrences, my father (an extremely early riser, 3 to 4 am) would hear a baby crying from the upstairs rooms where I sister was living with her new baby, however it was not the baby; she would be sound asleep.

On two occasions my sister woke in the middle of the night and looked over to the crib in the next room (it is an open floor plan with large archway doorways without doors) and notice a little girl standing next to the crib. She would simply blow it off and go back to sleep.

On one occasion a few years later my father, again the early riser, was standing in the doorway between the living room and dining room (a regular habit of his) he was looking out the picture window at the front of the house, just checking out the neighborhood. On this occasion he decided to look down next to him and there was a little girl standing next to him. He looked up and upon realizing what he saw he looked back and she was gone. By the time of this event my sister had married and moved out with her daughter.

Also, after my sister did move my dad said that the crying he heard from upstairs had become more frequent.

On to a couple of experiences of friends of the family that were quite odd. A few years after my sister moved out I took the upstairs area as my own, basically three rooms to myself. We decided to rent my old bedroom to a friend of mine who needed a place to stay.

One night he came home with his girlfriend and went directly to his room, my mom and I had been in the living room watching television. He came back a few minutes later and asked if I had been upstairs, when I said no he got a puzzled look on his face. He said as they pulled up out front that they looked to the upstairs windows and saw someone putting boards over the windows from the inside. Being as I was the one who had to sleep up there this made me a bit uncomfortable. When I finally went to bed (and I delayed it as long as possible) there was nothing out of place in the room, no boards on the window.

The other person to witness something odd from outside the house was my brother's girlfriend, they had come over for a family gathering and noted that when she pulled up, she too looked to the upstairs window and said there was a little girl standing in the window waving at them, there was no one upstairs at this time.

Now I can get to the personal experiences I had. The first was a couple of years before my mother and father passed away, the only people living in the house at the time were my parents and I. It was nearing Christmas and we had a metal wardrobe in what was once my bedroom, my mom had asked me to check for one of the gifts to make sure we didn't get a duplicate. I walked back to check and the cabinet was locked, I went to the kitchen to look for the key on key rack we kept inside the kitchen door. The would usually be kept here, it wasn't anywhere on the rack. I walked back to the bedroom to check if the key was in there, no luck. I went back to the rack one last time to make sure I didn't miss it, still not there. Finally as I was walking back to the bedroom I stepped on something sharp and metal, the key was there on the floor between the kitchen and the bedroom. This could be explained in many ways, the that room had just been vacuumed that day, the key would have been sucked up.

My last experience is the most odd, my wife to be and I were at the house cleaning up much of the debris left by my moving out, we had finished cleaning and were sitting at the dining room table we were leaving behind. We were sitting talking about my family and my recently deceased parents, I noted that the hall light was on and asked her to remind to turn it off before we left. This light is an old round florescent build with a pull chain. About an hour later were finally ready to leave and I remembered that I needed to turn off that light, however when I looked to hall the light was off and we had not moved from the table, we we're also alone in the house. I went and pulled the chain a couple of times to make sure the light worked and there were no problems. It was then we decided to leave as soon as possible.

I have not been in the house since 1991, but it remains in the family with my sister and husband living there now. They have not reported any new occurrences, but I keep asking.

H i I'm Melonlover, I have submitted some stories before, but I have more and in this story I will be going through everything that has happened to me in my house. So you may have heard one or two of these experiences before. Please read all of it and feel free to write a comment at the end. Before I start you will need to know that I am not and would not make this up.

It all started one day in year 4, it was just like any normal day in a normal week. I went to school, had tea, did homework and went to bed, except that night I decided to go to bed in my Mom's room. She has a double bed so there was plenty of room. I was upstairs in that room alone for a while because she had to finish of a few jobs downstairs. I was almost drifting of to sleep when I got this worried kind of feeling in my stomach, I could hear heavy breathing in my left ear. At first I thought I was imagining things, so I held my breath to see if it was me, but it most certainly was not! This made me paranoid to go in that room alone again, and my mom didn't believe me.

Another funny thing was that me and my mom were home alone and I was in the dining room and she was in the kitchen, they are quite close really. I was on the computer and suddenly there was like a bang upstairs, like as if someone stomped their foot or hit something. Then as soon as I had calmed down and thought it was nothing there was another bang right behind me! That's when I got really freaked out that I had to leave the room.

Another thing, I at first brushed of as nothing, was the little deep whispers in my ear. It first started a few years ago and I sort of forgot about it until I heard the second whisper last year 2007. Except I can never figure out what it is trying to say though it sounds like it wants to scare me. It's very faint.

One day when I came home from school I went in my living room to go and play on my laptop. I was just sitting there with the light on and they dimmed, went brighter and dimmed again. I thought this was weird and just assumed it was the bulb. Until I heard a sort of faint whisper kind of sound coming from the fireplace, I really can't describe it. Though it was like nothing I ever heard before.

You know the story at the top, well here is a follow on from that. About a year later from the breathing I thought the spirit had just left me alone and passed on. My mistake, because again I was alone in my mom's room and I was casually sitting on the bed, when I heard someone take a breath! I ran out the room and downstairs it got too far fetched for me I couldn't take it anymore.

I have never spoke or interacted with this spirit, and I don't know who it is. But it doesn't feel happy it feels as though it's messing with me or something. Because a little while ago I started to think could it be my granddad or maybe my neighbor? My granddad died a few years before I was born, and my neighbor who we were quite close to died when I was young. But I am positive it's not them because it doesn't feel like a really happy spirit.

Thank you for reading my story, I will keep you updated. Please sign and give me you word =). I will also post another story soon, love melonlover

A Deadly Dream,Canada,Misc,"W hen I was about 13 I had ran away from home and was staying with friends in saskatoon. Now I can't say they were ""good"" people as they all had their problems but for some reason they had befriended me and let me stay with them, amazing as they were all much older and could have gotten into lots of trouble about that.

Well, my best buddy and ""street brother"" was a guy called seadog, he had just turned 18, and gotten out of juvie. He was the kind of guy who always had a smile on his rugged face no matter what and looked out for me like a big brother would. Now at this time everyone was on drugs and going crazy and I ended up getting picked and put into a low security home for runaways.

Not even 3 days later I saw the header in the local star phoenix, ""3 caught in kidnapping plot, 2 still sought"" well the two they were looking for was saedog and his girl denny. Of course I took off looking for them to help get him out of town or whatever. The first place I stopped was at the apt, which still had crime scene tape across the battered door, it didn't take much to get it open and I went inside and retrieved my journal and the deck of tarot cards that had been a gift from seadog. He of course, wasn't there. But as it happens I got picked up outside by a cop who recognized me and much to my suprise, there in the back of the paddy wagon, was seadog, on the other side of the divider. His trademark smile was missing and he looked very sad, as I assured him all would be well and I would visit (of course!) we didn't have long to talk but in the time we did, he told me what had happened how he had walked in on a kidnapping in progress by the three ""friends"" and ended up being forced to stay. And now a long jail sentence was awaiting him.

Well they took him off to court and deposited me back at the home and that it would seem was that. But it wasn't. About 4 days later I fell asleep to the sound of rain on my window and the doors singing riders on the storm, and suddenly I was outside of seadogs prison cell, were he sat on a cot with a rope made from ripped and braided bed sheets hung from his hands. Tears were streaming down his cheeks and I tried to comfort him, but he didn't see me until he had hung himself, then it seemed he was looking right at me.

I woke and it was already morning, and I was kind of shook up about the dream but didn't think much of it until about 10 minute after I got I up a counselor came to my room saying I had a call.

The call was from charlotte, the planner of the whole kidnapping and my now ex good friend. She asked if I had heard about seadog, and I went off on her saying how could she, he was going to get so long in jail etc. She said ""honey I think you should sit down"" and then told me he had hung himself that night. The same night I had the dream and couldn't save him. That screwed me up for awhile and honestly I ran away and can't remember what I did for the next 4 months touring calgary and edmonton.

One day a wise woman told me I shouldn't feel guilty about it, if he had wanted to be saved he would have seen me, or sensed I was there and not done what he had. It wasn't my fault.

PS: Kids, it is never a good idea to run away from home, horrible things can happen and it doesn't fix anything. Take it from one who knows!

Three People in my House,"West Virginia, United States",Children Who See Spirits,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Children Who See Spirits :: Three People in my House

I 'm writing this because my sister has been acting weird. When I was sleeping one night I heard this shrill laughing from her room. So I went down the hall to see what it was and she was up with her light on talking to herself in the mirror. So I went back to bed and the next morning she was in her bed again. Before I went to school I asked her who she was talking to, she said she was talking to the girl in the mirror. So I was freaked out at first but then I did research on the house and there was three people that died here.

It was a little girl who I think she was talking to in the mirror, and a little boy and a father which is downstairs. I usually see the man downstairs sitting in an rocking chair next to the fireplace when it is lit. But I have never actually seen the girl or the boy.

So one day she was talking to herself in the mirror in her room again and asked her what was the ""little girls"" name was, she said it was nicole. I have always believed in ghosts and have seen them. The man's name downstairs is Tom. And the little girls name was nicole, but on the research, they did not mention the little boys name. So I set up a motion camera in her room and it takes pictures with motion. So when I looked at the film after school one day it had pictures of this clear tan figure of the shape of a little girl playing with the dora doll house, so I was startled at first but I always see ghosts everywhere and my mom also does.

Do you think she has the ability to see ghosts or is it an imaginary friend? Can you give me your opinion?

The Grocery Store Ghost  2,"Tennessee, United States",Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: The Grocery Store Ghost  2

A fter the incident described in part 1 , I never experienced anything of that magnitude again. I did however have a few more experiences that left me wondering. There were plenty of times that you could hear inexplicable noises. There were the ""classic crashes"" when nothing had fell. The sound that made me scratch my head the most, was the sound of the front door being unlocked after closing.

One evening about two years ago when I got to work, I went straight to the boss's office to tell him that I had received a summons for jury duty. After talking about the summons for a few minutes I started to leave when the boss says, ""Oh by the way why did you leave the shopping basket rack sitting in the middle of the floor last night..."" I insisted that I didn't move the rack at all. He said that it wasn't a big deal, he figured I moved it to sweep under it and had forgot to put it back. I told him that if I had of moved it to sweep, that I would have moved it back when I mopped. It was then when we both realized, it had to have been Susie. Susie was our pet name for whatever was in the store.

The other two times that I saw something was through the monitor in the office, both times after closing. The first thing I saw was a large black mass standing in the first aisle. It watching my part-time kid mopping the floor. I saw it in the office monitor as I was counting up the register. I was keeping an eye on the kid. He was new and we weren't sure about his honesty. The mass had a vague human shape, although you couldn't make out any arms or legs. You could make out a head but no facial features. I stepped out to see if I could actually see it but I couldn't. When I stepped back in the office and looked at the monitor you couldn't see it anymore. I never said anything to the kid about it. I didn't want to have to finish mopping.

The second time was right about the same time period. I had closed up and was in the office counting up. I had a habit of keeping an eye on the monitor, especially when I was there alone. We had a four-way system and on the outside camera feed I noticed a large blue orb. Now I'm not one to put much stock in orbs because there are too many things they can be. This one was different. It was about the size of a volleyball and it was solid blue. It floated around as if it was hunting for something. It lasted a good two to three minutes and it was gone. It didn't fly away or get out of camera range, it just vanished.

I quit the store in October of 2007 and I just miss two things, all the kids I made friends with and ""Susie...""

To my Lost Siblings,Australia,Ouija Board / Seances,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Ouija Board / Seances :: To my Lost Siblings

I was born on 5th May after a very difficult pregnancy and an even more difficulty labour that nearly caused both, my mother's and my life. Mum still narrates every minute of it, with tears in her eyes, every chance she gets and I know that she still suffers every time she does.

Grandma (when still alive) would wait until the very end of the story to add, ""who would have thought you would make it after all you've been through and having lost those two ones the previous year!""

From the moment I was old enough to understand the world around me, I felt very uncomfortable every time I heard about ""those ones"" but, seeing my mother torn, I didn't dare to ask anything further until I grew a little more and decided to confront both my mum and ""nona""

Nona spoke, mum just listened and nodded. ""The first time mummy had a baby in her tummy she lost it within a month. The second one, it was a boy. She lost that one when she was 4 months pregnant with it. But now, everything is ok cause you're here...""

""And where are those two?"" I would ask to hear,""they are safe in heaven where God is taking care of them for us...""

Needless to say that ""heaven"" sounded scary to a restless child who refused to understand why we couldn't visit and even scarier as I realized the meaning of death at still a young age.

I would casually ask nona if those who pass on remain as they were in life and she, not thinking anything of it, would go on to reply ""yes, of course"". Even worse, I would never let on that I was ok with me seeing my brother but how was I supposed to tell her that, since my other sibling was not fully formed, I was terrified in the thought of looking at an embryo. (It might sound funny to me now but not when I was 7 or 8). So I would constantly have this feeling of not sleeping alone in bed but as I grew even older I blamed my childhood drama for it. I still think it was that and nothing else.

Having joined an exchange-student program, at the age of twenty, I find myself studying in Australia at LaTrobe University. I spent most of my free time hanging out with two of my younger cousins, three australian friends (we are still close), and Ghaa (an african girl who claimed to have had powers!) She would often try to get me involved in their seances and I would always avoid it, partly because I doubted her gift and, partly because she made me a little uneasy; besides, I couldn't be absolutely sure she was a fake. Finally, I gave in and joined them one night.

The moment she began explaining the procedure I felt it was a mistake. The woman was talking about unborn spirits not dead relatives of any sort. She was talking about guardian spirits who were called upon for protection but you needed a strong prayer to, first, be protected from the guardian? What was all that? I said I wanted out but since we were in an isolated area and couldn't go anywhere alone, she warned me that if I stayed outside the circle, she couldn't protect me. For all that, I finally stayed.

The seances began with her speaking in african and singing and making weird faces and at that point I began shaking with terror. She served as a medium through which the second spirit spoke and answered questions and every now and then someone would fall in some kind of trance I wouldn't buy and so I managed to slowly relax since it was too dramatic for my liking!

Then Ghaa would ask someone to leave the circle claiming the spirit had enough and would place that someone in another circle next to ours with some more prayers and such.

I was beginning to get a little impatient because time was passing and they wouldn't finish the ""theatrical play"" when she suddenly turned to me saying ""the spirit now wants you"". I knew I could ask a question after the spirit allowed it according to Ghaa and I was absolutely determined, first, to avoid stupid questions such as who's to die next and, second, questions that she would know the answers to, from my cousins.

I asked my ""safe"" questions such as ""which country would be my next stop"" or ""will I ever return home"" but suddenly began to feel unwell; the kind of feeling you get as if you have butterflies in your stomach, the ache in your bones, like you've caught a cold and then a bit of cold sweating. Ghaa's voice was heard like from a distance and I felt distracted by something unknown. A little afterwards, I began feeling better but I had the distinct feeling that something had escaped my attention. I usually get the same feeling when I have had an extra drink and I know I must have said something more than I should have.

When I recovered from what I thought to be a little dizziness, I found my youngest cousin's hand on mine but the seances was in progress in spite of my little incident, and another one was asking the questions.

Finally, the gathering ended with all of us exhausted and me being distressed.

Back home I was continuously asked if I was feeling better and I regained my courage to ask about the events that took place during my questioning. I was sure I had missed something but I wasn't sure what.

Helen, the youngest told me I suddenly looked very upset and said a few times ""no, no, stop!"" I then supposedly said ""I'm on the 5th May, not June or January!""

Now May is the month I was born. I'm also sure June and January are the months my mother had both miscarriages. I don't and have not been able to remember myself saying any of these things, my cousins claim, as I am sure they couldn't have known from my mother.

I still try to think of it as pure coincidence but, just to be on the safe side that was the first and last time I ever participated in any such gatherings. I know that if my siblings are out there, they would have no reason to harm me so, if, I really mean if, this was the spirit talking, I now am sure it's not a benevolent one that I should ever encounter again!

The Woman In the Window,"Michigan, United States",Psychic / Medium,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Psychic / Medium :: The Woman In the Window

I grew up in small town in Michigan and as a little girl, me and my brothers played happily in our yard. Sometimes, we would swing on the bouncy neighbors fence and he would get angry and chase us away as the fence was bending and getting grotesquely lower and lower to the ground. Most of the time, we were good kids. The older man and his wife next door were quiet and often kept to themselves. They were nice elderly people. When I would see him coming and going, at times, I would run up to him and say, ""Hello, Mr., how is your Mrs..."" He would nod and say she was fine. He seemed strangely sad when he said it though. I just sensed something was wrong.

His Mrs., would often sit on the front porch when the weather was fair and sometimes I would run up to the porch and say to her, ""Hello, Mrs..."", and wave. She rarely spoke and would just nod her head in acknowledgement. She often wore a shawl and a long dark dress. Her hair was in a gray bun and I guessed that she was pretty old. I guess she caught a chill easily is why she always seemed to have a shawl. She liked to sit in her rocking chair by the window sometimes and rock back and forth. I would wave at her when I saw her.

They say I looked like Punky Brewster. I had freckles on my nose and a short choppy hair cut. I guess I was somewhat of a tomboy because I had six brothers and three of them were younger than I was. I guess I was around the age of six or seven years old.

Everything amused me when I was young. When I would walk outside, sometimes the wind would suddenly stir up and swoosh around me and the leaves in the yard would dance around me in a perfect circle. I would just laugh and turn in a counter clock wise circle as the leaves danced around me. The wind was my friend. The trees were my friends, the butterflies, ants and crickets were my friends. I had real friends and a large family but nature seemed to talk to me in a way that always caught my imagination.

It had been a long time since I had seen the Mr., and his Mrs. I faintly remember people walking in and out of his house dressed in black. I was collecting pretty rocks in the yard and that kept my attention.

One day, I saw the Mrs., again, sitting on the front porch, rocking back and forth, wearing a dark shawl and a long dark dress. Her hair was up in a gray bun, as usual. Something seemed different this time. It seemed like she was far, far away, like in another dimension. I waved at her and she looked at me but did not speak or nod as she usually did. I saw her several times that week. Sometimes rocking on the porch and sometimes sitting in the window rocking back and forth. I was preoccupied and so I would just wave at her when I saw her in the window and go back to my playing.

Later that day, I saw the Mr., coming home and walking sadly up to his house. I ran up to him and I said, ""Hello, Mr. I saw your Mrs., sitting on the porch and rocking in her rocking chair and in the window too... She was rocking back and forth..."" He looked at me strangely and shook his head no. I was insistent, I know what I saw. ""Yes. I imposed myself. I did see her..."" He looked at me and spoke calmly and said. ""My Mrs. is dead. She has been dead for a couple of weeks now...""

I was struck dumb. I did see her and I described to him what she was wearing. He looked strangely at me and sad and just walked slowly into his house. Shaking his head no.

It wasn't the last time that I saw her. I would see her every now and then and I always asked myself, every time I saw her. If she is dead, why can I see her? Shouldn't she be invisible? I wanted to speak to her but I was afraid. If she was really dead, why did she keep appearing as though she was still living?

I heard my mother talking to the neighbors and on the phone and she said she swears that she saw that woman sitting in the window, rocking in her rocking chair... The one who died. I never told mom, I saw her too. Mom would quiet down when she noticed us kids within hearing distance. My younger brothers said they didn't see her.

As I grew up, I never forgot her. I guess she and her husband had been together for so long that she couldn't leave him... Not right away. She had to visit him every now and then before she took her long journey to the other side.

I have often been visited by those who have died and passed over. Sometimes family members would make themselves known to me. My father and mother both visited me near the times of their deaths.

I have noticed that when people die, they don't go to the other side, right away. Sometimes they linger and say goodbye to those that they loved. Sometimes they get lost. Sometimes they live amongst us. I don't see them as often as I used to but every once in a while, I will see them. Sometimes, they look just as real as you and me. Sometimes, they hide in shadows, like when my father died, I sensed him standing in my closet, in the dark. My father use to spy on me trying to catch me doing something wrong. Or sometimes they float upon the ceilings, like my mother did when she visited me. They often don't mean us any harm, they often want to leave us with messages of encouragements. However, it is scary.

One day, I will die and when I think about visiting my close family and loved ones, I would like my last message to be this:

Something Black and Oppressive,United Kingdom,Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: Something Black and Oppressive

T his is a story I have been told by my dad, I know he would never lie to me or even exaggerate. These stories have also been backed up by my mum. Before my sister and I were born my parents had a small house in Attleborough, Norfolk that was opposite the zoo in which they were both employed.

My brother was about 2-3 years old and had grown up in that house, since my parents had moved in, my mum (who has always been sensitive to spirits etc) would refuse to go to the toilet by herself. It was a single room down a flight of stairs in the basement (I've seen pictures and it looks very spooky). It would always get very cold down there and lights would flicker on and off, the door would unlock and swing open and in the night it would become clogged and start flushing by itself and a long shadow would often stretch in front of the door for a few seconds after it would swing open... I can hear what you're thinking, dodgy plumbing and electrics, it is a basement jacksy after all... Not quite.

When my parents first moved (remember, it's opposite Banham Zoo) my mum was pregnant with their first, my brother, and they settled down in front of the television to watch the first TV showing of the Omen. Halfway through the film the lights start flickering and an almighty bang of what seemed to be an upstairs window led my dad upstairs to investigate. There was nothing, he came back downstairs and started watching the movie again. Suddenly another bang and they could clearly hear the howler monkeys screaming in hysterics and the wolves barking and howling... Seconds after they start the power goes off completely... They haven't watched the Omen since... I assure you, my brother isn't evil.

Finally, when my brother was 2-3 years old, my dad had put him down to bed. He was quite ill at this time with respiratory problems and scarring on his lungs, it didn't seem to be getting much better at the time. After going downstairs he turns to see a figure clearly walk from the landing into my brothers room. He grabs a blunt object and races upstairs only to find my brother sitting upright staring at the door. They move out 2 months later and whilst setting him down to bed for the first time in the new house, he sleepily says ""at least that man won't be in my room anymore keeping me awake"". My Brother doesn't remember this at all, only that he never slept well in that house and felt cold all the time... He gradually began to recover over the next year and except from asthma is very much well.

After moving out my parents discovered that the property was once a set of 3 houses together as one block of flats that was hit during the war then eventually divided up. When they were flats they were owned by some sort of Gangster boss who, after a dispute with one of the tenants, he was shot 3 times in the chest and found underneath the floorboards in the wreckage when the flats where bombed... My dad recons it was him and was definitely NOT a friendly spirit as the atmosphere always seemed black and oppressive

Phantom Shower,"New York, United States",Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: Phantom Shower

A s background, I live in a house that has had some paranormal activity since we moved in 4-1/2 years ago. My family experiences shadow people, voices and full apparitions. We've only captured orbs on cameras, but have picked up some EVPs. On top of this general activity that we experience, my 13-year-old daughter is a sensitive that regularly sees and speaks with spirits, both in our home and other locations. My family (husband, 13-yr-old daughter, 17-yr-old daughter) and I go on paranormal investigations as much as we have the opportunity, and it seems the more investigations we do, the more we open ourselves up to paranormal experiences in our home and elsewhere.

This is one of my experiences... One day recently I had the opportunity to veg around the house watching TV - not done very often! - and was laying on my bed with the bedroom door shut. The only other (living) person in the house was my 17-yr-old daughter. She was in her bedroom in the basement, at the other end of the house.

I heard someone go into the main bathroom, which was on the other side of my closet wall, and turn on the shower. The shower stayed on for 5 to 10 minutes, then shut off. I thought nothing of it at the time, thinking my daughter had stayed up late and was taking a late afternoon shower. Then I heard a child's voice say ""Mommy!"".

I got up off the bed and crossed the room, thinking it was my daughter wanting me to get her a towel out of the linen closet in the hallway, a frequent occurrence. I remember thinking to myself that my daughter's voice sounded more youthful than her age 17 voice, but attributed it to the door being shut, echoes from the small bathroom, etc... When I entered the hallway to open the closet door, I glanced at the bathroom door. I was puzzled because the door was full open and the lights were out!

I immediately knew that it wasn't my daughter who had taken a shower, and called out ""Mommy is here. Do you need something? Are you there?"" I paused and waited for a response, but none came. I also saw no one or heard no movement. After a couple of minutes I went down to my daughter's room and confirmed with her that she had not taken a shower and had not called my name. It was a cold day in late fall, so I know the windows were closed.

I never did determine the source of the voice, the child calling to mommy. Stupidly, I didn't even think at the time to look in the tub to see if it was wet. That would have been really freaky! My younger daughter has seen a little boy peaking up the stair way near the bathroom door. Maybe it was him taking a shower that afternoon. I wish he had waited around for the towel!

Ghosts in my House,United Kingdom,Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: Ghosts in my House

E ver since I was little I have seen these people in my house. The first time, I remember, was when I was around 6 or 7 and each night for about a month, I would wake up in the night and see a woman sitting at my desk, write a letter, put that wax thing on the letter then walk out. I was always freaked but I was only young so I thought nothing really of it.

The second time, when I was 7 or 8, (I had a new room because of the extension and my old room was now a bathroom) I had come out of my bedroom at around midnight to go to the toilet. Then I saw a woman (looking around 20-30 years old). She walked into the bathroom (originally a bedroom) holding a candle. She never looked at me but I went straight back to bed and never told anybody, until now, as I thought it was again, a dream.

I didn't see anything else for a few years until recently, when I walked out of the study (also part of an extension) and an old man was standing, staring at what used to be a coat cupboard but to me it was the hallway. I ran back into the study, took deep breaths and walked out again. He was gone.

I then being an inquisitive 12 year old, looked up costume for the edwardian period (my house is edwardian) and the clothes were so similar to what I saw the man and woman wearing!

Then, only about 2-3 weeks ago, I was watching TV with two friends. I don't know why, but I looked at the stairs and I saw the woman on the stairs and then man standing below. They were talking. I blinked and they vanished. I was completely speechless and I kept staring at the stairs.

I then looked in these documents that our solicitors gave us. It said all the people that used to live in the house. Two names hit me. James and Myra Baxter. They moved into the house in 1910 and in either 1913 or 1923 (I can't remember) James died of old age in the house!

Thank you for reading my very long entry. These ghosts never notice me and it's like watching small clips of the past. The ""apparitions"" aren't clear, but they're not blurry. It's really hard to explain.

Soon, my friend is coming for a sleep over and we are going to see if we can communicate with James or Myra.

My Experience with a Three Dimensional Shadow Person,"Texas, United States",Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: My Experience with a Three Dimensional Shadow Person

I guess shadow people are real. I never thought about talking about what I saw until I happened to read a story about them. I had always considered our house to be a haunted place, but in a strange way that most houses aren't. Our house is to this day only 14 years old and was built on 'new' ground. I say new ground because sometimes a haunting can occur in a new house that was built on top of the ground that something may have been haunting. This house was built over wooded land... You know, they chopped down trees and built a subdivision. I feel this is important to mention because you'd think and most people do think that this would negate a house from being haunted.

We have this one room above our garage which is our guest room. Over the years, we've jokingly referred to it as the grandpa room (another story for another day). Now I've had three grandparents die on me in the last couple of years, and none of them have been without paranormal occurrences. There's three spirits that pass through from time to time, you know, no big deal... They're my grandparents.

Well I've always neglected to speak of the fourth. It's not my grandparents. I feel it there all the time in that guest room watching me. (When I left for college, my sister got my room because it got its own bathroom attached to it so now my bedroom is the guest room when I come home for the summer and winter breaks) These things feed off of your fear. I kid you not, I'm an engineer and I looked at this thing from a mechanical and experimental viewpoint. If you have this thing that seems to manifest itself when you get scared, why not turn it into sort of a paranormal experiment. Well I did...

I sat there and allowed myself to get scared... Really really scared. I let the fear build up and sure enough I started to get this feeling that I was being watched. I had never been able to sleep in the room, and had always gotten an uneasy feeling when I was in there. Come to think of it, we have two dogs who frequent the upstairs and I have never once seen either of them in there. Well I got up, turned around and didn't see anything so I asked the empty room out loud why I couldn't sleep there and this voice returned ""Get out, this is our room..."" I'm not sure if this was auditory or not but I definitely heard it. The funny thing about it is, the moment you leave the room, everything is alright. I usually slept in our game room right outside of that room on the couch and was never bothered except for one night when I decided to totally ignore the presence.

I was trying to sleep on the couch outside of the room one night when it seem the presence decided it was cool to leave the room. Now this sucks because you can't see the damn thing but you most definitely can feel it in the room with you. I just went downstairs and slept on the couch down there and with the TV on I felt safe. Well I realized I hadn't brushed my teeth and washed my face and what not so I finally worked up the courage to walk back upstairs and over to the guest room where my stuff was. When I walked up the stairs and got to the top I came face to face with this 'thing'.

Let me go into a little more detail about this 'thing'. I saw it for about two full seconds and got a very clear view of what it was. I definitely saw this and I don't know why I put off ever talking about it. It was definitely a shadow yet it was three dimensional... It had depth. It was about five feet tall, I'd say approximately a foot shorter than me by comparison given in my memory. I was close to this thing too, about a foot away. It flew right past me really really freaking fast yet I still got a good look at it.

What got me was at first I thought it was a monk. It was looking down at the ground and I got the feeling that it did not want to be seen. Like looking at it, I got the feeling that it wanted to be something noticed in the background but not ever directly seen. I don't remember clearly whether or not it had arms but it almost appeared to be wearing a cloak with a hood on. It was a big, wavy, flowing cloak and seemed to have ragged pieces trailing behind it. It was running in the opposite direction as me... I was going up the stairs and when I got to the top the thing ran AROUND me as to not touch me and ran down the stairs. It was dark... JUST like a shadow but with three dimensions instead of two.

Now I completely blew this off as a hallucination until I did a little research on ""shadow people"" through google. Try going to wikipedia and looking up shadow people . There's two pictures on there. In the second picture it shows two sketches. I saw the thing on the right. I saw that EXACT thing. I couldn't have asked for a better picture of what I saw. The only thing is I don't remember seeing eyes, but then again the thing wasn't trying to look at me.

Boy Scouts,Canada,Apparitions / Voices / Touches,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Apparitions / Voices / Touches :: Boy Scouts

M y mom, my brother and I were driving to Vancouver Island B.C and we went the way that takes you through Whistler and Lilouet. It was about 9:30 and we were driving through Lilouet B.C and we stopped for gas, food and bathroom breaks. When we were pulling out from the gas station we saw these two men dressed like boy scouts, they had some luggage with them and they were hitch hikers.

So we just kept driving, we drove for about an hour, no cars had passed us and all of the sudden there they were standing on the side of the road in the dark at around 10:30 at night. Now let me make this very clear NO CARS passed us at all nothing. So we got a little freaked out. We drove a bit faster and again NO ONE passed us. We drove through Whistler B.C and at the edge of town there they were AGAIN. NO ONE passed us at all I kept watch the whole time and by the second time we saw them it was around 12:30 at night we thought were were going crazy, we were so scared.

Lucky my brother was asleep because he is a a bit of a chicken and he really believes in things like this. But I would really like if anyone could tell me what this was or if they've had a similar encounter. It would also be great if anyone could tell me if there have been any murders of people that fit that description in that area?

Someone Watching from the Attic,"Florida, United States",Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: Someone Watching from the Attic

I was really exhausted. I had gone antique shopping with my Mom and her 2 best friends and we had just come home. They were unpacking the car, and I went to crash on the couch, kick back, and watch some TV. I clicked the on button. When I sat down, I heard a stretching sound. It sounding almost like... A creaking sound. I suspected it was the garage mechanisms on the ceiling. Although they were not in any use, it couldn't have been them. But my eyes quickly caught onto the styrofoam square covering the cutout in the ceiling that lead to the attic. I saw it partially open, and slowly closing. I almost died. I couldn't breathe. I ran out of that room SO fast, and QUICKLY closed, and locked, the door. I quickly grabbed my Mom's arm and whispered: We need to get out of the house, NOW! There is someone IN the attic! She and her friends got the gun and the phone (for the need of police) and went into the garage. I was scared out of my socks.

They checked both openings to the attic, and found no sign of life. Nothing at all. My Mom's friend (Heather) suggested it was the pressure from the door, when we opened it. But it was never closed. The front door had been closed, but I opened it long before the attic opening had opened. AND, it made a weird creaking noise that only stopped when I found its source by just looking at it. This happened a few times again not long after.

On a side note, I have heard this creaking sound before, in my bedroom. I was sleeping and woke up to hear a buzzing sound. I thought it was the fan. Then I thought it was the modem. But I slowly traced the sound to coming from behind my small cushioned chair in the corner. I ran out of the room and slept elsewhere.

Violent Shadows and Angel Rescues,"Arizona, United States",Misc,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Misc :: Violent Shadows and Angel Rescues

A t first I would hear voices, three female and one male, they came at me like a windstorm, with phrases of confusion and constantly telling me that I'd be better off dead because I was a worthless human being. Ignoring them was hard. The male who calls himself ""ROB"" (a tall man with a very assertive voice) started getting louder and would bug me all night, I could feel him touch my legs, he'd whisper mean things in my ear. I started sleeping with headphones!

One night, he just got in my face! I could feel his eyelashes against my cheek. He was so mean! Told me if I didn't obey his direct orders he would kill me. I still never listened, so he hurt me really bad, and often. He started off by slapping me, but I could feel it only from the inside, as well as a strong punch in my gut. Imagine a painful squeeze inside your body, my stomach and heart. Red and green lights would pick my legs all over.

Everyone kept telling me that it's not possible, until they saw my pictures and video tape! Since then, my family, friends and pastor have been more supportive and it seems like they are fading faster and faster. I know in my heart that I will spend eternity in paradise, no matter how much torment and suffering I may have here on earth... and they are not!

I can see them, talk to them, touch them, feel them, they are very powerful. They are extremely smart. I want the world to know that those voices in your head... Are real losers! Who and what they are have NO RIGHT TO HARM US. Sometimes I don't think they are going to let me live to see morning, and other times they leave me alone for such a long period of time that I even forget they were ever in my life.

I video taped a light flying around me and my children, then I saw a Bigger brighter light going after the little one. I found out later, these lights are called ""ORBS"". I have seen bad ORBS with skull faces and a big bright angel orb.

A few months after that, I saw an ANGEL's face briefly peek around the corner. It was of a young man who's image was like someone made his perfect face made of pale green cotton candy, and he sang with others, the music was unreal, beautiful beyond belief that actually made me ""feel"" good and peaceful. It's a thrill like no other on this planet.

The mean Shadow voices, call themselves ""Supreme Beings"", people like you and me with ""Supreme Powers"", that would be a great fear of mine. Why this ""ROB"" Shadow punishes me and is jealous? Hates me to date? Several times he has appeared to me in the image of an ex-boyfriend DM, who tried to hurt me really bad about eighteen years ago. Could there be a connection? I don't want them to hurt my children or loved ones or anyone else out there going through the same thing, I just want to know are there more people out there like me, what can we do to help eachother fight back?

Little Girl in my Bathroom and Two Boys on a Local Street,Canada,Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: Little Girl in my Bathroom and Two Boys on a Local Street

M ost of you have probably read my first story My Would Be Brother and Late Cousin and some of you may think I saw them because I merely wanted to, but if that was true, I think they would have appeared more then once but some of you say they appeared because they wanted to say good bye because they didn't have a chance. I would have to go with that one. Now on to my story.

My house is a portable that used to be a classroom. My dad renovated it into a house. As far as I know it is not haunted in any way. Our bathroom was built by my dad. And some mornings I would wake up and go to take a shower but see a little girl sitting on the freezer thing. At first I never really thought anything of it. But later on I would politely ask her to leave.

One day I asked her to leave and she asked me ""Why do I always have to leave"" I told her I was taking a shower and I am not comfortable with anyone else in the room while I'm taking it. She said I used to let her, that is when I said ""That is because I thought you were a figment of my imagination"". After I said that she said she would leave and I realized I forgot some things in my room. So I went back to get them and I saw the little girl leave out the door which was open. Odd usually it is closed. But my dad was outside having a smoke.

Another odd thing, he is usually asleep until 8. And my dog was just outside asleep at the door step since we got him off his leash. He started barking at something. My dad was yelling at him to settle down. As I got outside I asked what was going on. My dad said Blackjack was barking at something he couldn't see. I saw him barking at the girl so it was then I realized that she was a ghost or something.

There is a Church near my school on a run that is called Chevron because you pass a Chevron gas station. That church used to be a home for two parents and their two children. They were both boys and both home schooled. There was two children who always walked home that way and would always feel like someone is watching them when they walked by. The two home schooled children would always watch them as they go by wishing someone would visit them to play with them.

One day the two children who walk by went missing. They ended up to be kidnapped into the home schooled children's house. No one knows for sure what happened to them. Some say they were murdered some say they were fine. But whenever you walk by that church by yourself you always get the feeling someone is watching you.

Sk8ter Boi,"Texas, United States",Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: Sk8ter Boi

I have another funny ghost story for ya'll. Yes, the Texan just said ya'll. One day I was driving home from a doctor's appointment about noon and drove around the corner of the street into my driveway. As I was parking my car in the corner house driveway of my home, I saw my teenage neighbor who is about 15 to 16 years old, run neck-break speed out of his house and into the rose bushes our neighbor has planted across the street from his house in a dive. I call this kid Sk8er boi (skater boy) because he always does skateboard tricks out the in street daring me to run him over (so far I have resisted the temptation).

That day Sk8ter Boi was wearing only a pair of tore up blue jeans, no shirt and he was barefoot. It rarely gets really cold here in Texas but on that particular day I remember it being cold enough that a jacket would be necessary not to freeze your butt off. So Sk8ter boi was clearly upset or scared or something to be running out of his house in just a pair of ripped up blue jeans.

Curious because this kid thinks he is the baddest of the bad I watched as he caught his breath and untangled himself from the rosebush, I was laughing my butt off; I'm not going to lie. I started to get out of my car and realized that Sk8ter boi was walking over towards me. I asked him if he was ok. Sk8ter boi was paler than usual and his blue eyes wide but not dilated (I made sure to check, he has a history as a small time drug dealer). He had scratched his chest up pretty good with the rosebushes too. Sk8ter boi said ""Well, It's a long story but my house is haunted"", he paused to look at me, I guess to see if I was going to laugh at him. I gestured for him to continue. He said ""Well, I heard something beating on the walls of my garage and screaming at me and calling my name and I'm home alone and I'll be damned if I'm going into the house again alone"".

At this point I should point out that his kid really thinks he is a gangster league tough guy, on many occasions I have heard him across the street cursing out his mother like a sailor on shore leave. If he was my kid I would have beaten him to death already, however his mother puts up with it for some reason or another (Must be love). The cops are no strangers to their address either...

However on this day Sk8ter boi then begged to use my phone to call his mother. I was not going to let this kid use my house phone because I don't like him and I was home alone but since he wanted his ""Mommy"" I felt bad for him and handed him my cell phone. I figured if he took off running with it, it was insured and I would get a brand new shiny one. However Sk8ter boi just called his Mama and got her voice mail like five times in a row leaving pitiful messages about how she needed to come home right then. It was pretty cold outside and I wanted to get in my house by then, so I asked Sk8ter boi what he was going to do?

Sk8ter boi just looked at me and said ""I guess I'm going to sit in the driveway until Mom comes home"" and then thanked me and walked off back across the street to sit at the very edge of his driveway huddled up in a little ball. I was still in shock that he was polite to me and I went inside my house but peeked out every few minutes to see if he was still there. I was slightly concerned for his well-being but like I said I was home alone and he thinks he's a tough guy... So I figured the cold wouldn't hurt him that bad. He sat there for about 10 minutes until his mother drove up into the driveway and they all went into the house together. Unfortunately at this point I had to go to work and didn't get to go over there and talk to his Mama. Man, I wanted to talk to his Mama.

Now this is just my speculation but... I think that that kid is so bad to his Mama (she is an only parent) and little siblings that whatever is in their house likes to torment him when he is alone at his house to take him down a notch or five.

Pictures on the Wall,Australia,Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: Pictures on the Wall

T his happened to me and my ex-best mate mid 2006. We lived above a tattoo parlour on the main road of our town. (mind you, that parlour has had nothing but bad things happen to it since it opened. i.e water pipes bursting and electricity cutting out even though every other store's electricity was working etc). Its something that I will take to my grave (excuse the pun) and will ever doubt all these things happening. I had just met my now boyfriend and was spending heaps of time with him to the point where I was barely spending any nights at home.

I remember coming home on morning about 7 or 8 am before my boyfriend had to go to work. My friend was asleep in her bed and as she heard me come in, she invited me to come and sit on the bed with her. She told me about how the night before, she swears that she could hear footsteps and people running on top of the roof, she said she even called the police to investigate but nothing was found. I thought she needed more sleep.

That night I didn't end up seeing my boyfriend as he was having a boys night out. So for once I was staying at home. I don't fully remember the first thing that happened but the things that happened that I do remember were the ones that scared me the most.

Sitting in my lounge room, little sparks of light started to dart around the room. I wasn't sure if it was my imagination so I asked Kat. She saw it too. I moved into the next room and it was still doing it. When these sparks touched me it was like a little sting, that only lasted for a moment. Kind of like a small electric spark.

To stop freaking out I decided to put some music on to lighten the mood. This was one of the scariest things I have have ever experienced The song by Rhiannon called SOS was playing and I was in the kitchen with Kat. Next thing it started to slow down and it sounded like a record being played really, really slowly. Next thing a high pitched scream, maybe not a scream but a noise (like something was trying to speak to us, or for us to notice it) came from the cd player and I froze. Kat went running to it to turn it off and kicked it broken instead. This noise was child like, it freaked me out. I saw that movie White noise and remember thinking that it so stupid. But trust me, that movie was made by someone who really experienced it!

Now, we started noticing the markings on the wall. Funny though cause we noticed them when we first moved in but now they actually started to look like drawings. My bedroom, which mind you I never ever felt comfortable in. Which funnily enough I never unpacked anything for the whole time I lived there. I didn't even put my bed together. Figures of crosses and a man by a graveyard started appearing. It took us ages to tell what it looked like and then as soon as we did, the pictures on the walls didn't stop.

Down the hallway the figure of like a large shark head (sounds like a stupid story but I swear this is true) it looked like it traveled down the hallway with its mouth wide open. It got smaller each time as it traveled down the hallway. You could feel the bumps where the eyes were in the picture. Behind the front door you could see marks of a man hanging and the door knob was its noose.

But there was one figure that would never stop appearing. One of a man in a black cowboy like hat. His face never appeared. He hid underneath it but you could see his eerie smile. It was everywhere all through the house.

The one picture that I will never forget was the one of him outside my friends bedroom which all the bad things happened near. It looked like a comic book story on the wall but it was taller than us. First it was him walking up the hallway, behind him he held a gun which you could see in his hand, then the next he was closer and you could see a body lying on the floor with him pointing the gun towards it. Then the last was him with a close up of him in his hat. Walking away. With that smile. I will never forget it until the day I die.

That house has something very wrong with it. You would hear running up and down the hallway. I would be sitting on the bed and you would hear and feel something jump on to the bed next to me. You would even see the sheets move. Instead of black finger marks above the doors the finger marks were white. Bad things have happened in there. I could feel it. Everything sounds so far fetched I know. But there is so much more to this story but I don't have enough time to type it all down now. I feel so much better actually getting all of this out for the first time.

Has anyone else experienced pictures appearing on the walls? The more you let them know that you see them the more intense it gets. Does anyone know any good books that I could read about things like this...?

To this day I drive past that place and still get an uneasy feeling from it...

Pets Who Protect Us - Dead or Alive,"Ohio, United States",Pets / Animals,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Pets / Animals :: Pets Who Protect Us - Dead or Alive

E veryone knows that a beloved pet leaves a special place in our hearts after they're gone, but do they try to protect us after they die? When my husband and I decided to move out on the farm in Southeastern Ohio, the kids wanted a dog. We had a total of three outside dogs while the kids were growing up. Yet, the last dog, Lucky, who got his name because our son picked him over the other 11 pups, couldn't have been a better companion for our son and daughter. Faithful, loving, and a good protector, he loved us all.

After the kids went off to college, he became my companion. Sadly to say, he took sick and died before his eighth birthday. I cried for days and I missed him so much. Yet, there were times when I felt his presence.

I'd been feeling sick off and on for several days. My husband was driving truck and I was alone in the house one night when something strange happened. I went up to bed and the next thing I knew I heard Lucky barking. I knew my dog's bark and in my sleepiness I felt extreme joy at hearing my old friend again. But then I remembered Lucky had died; how could he be barking? Fully awake by this time, I turned on the light. I felt really sick, weird even, and I managed to get downstairs when it hit me. Something was terribly wrong with our furnace.

I ran to open the doors and windows and shut the furnace off. It had been carbon monoxide that had been making me sick we discovered later. Had I not heard Lucky barking to warn me about the danger, I might not be here today. Once we replaced the furnace and all was safe, I never heard him again. I believe our faithful, loving pets do try to protect us even in death.

As a young child, my parents always had cats or dogs in the house and on a number of occasions those animals sensed unseen visitors and acted strangely. Maybe it was the house or spirits in that house who posed a threat to us, I don't know. But I do know that animals see things we can't see and try to warn us of danger.

When I was five or six years old, we lived in an old house that made creepy noises, especially at night. But it wasn't uncommon for my mother to hear the front door open and footsteps move across the living room floor while cooking in the kitchen during the day. When she called out, ""I'll be there in a minute..."" thinking it was a neighbor lady; only to find no one there, we looked at each other and shivered. This happened quite a lot, but when I woke up one night and heard our dog growling next to my bed, I strained to see in the dim night light and saw the shadow of a man. He was large and wore a hat and long coat. I quickly pulled the covers over my head.

The next morning I told my parents about the man. They just looked at me and then at each other. About that time the phone rang, my grandmother called to say my father's Uncle Jimmy had passed away the night before. He always sent greeting cards to my brother and me, laughed with us, and although he had a loud, gruff voice, the big man, who wore a black hat and long black coat, never scared us for a minute. But Tippy, our dog, didn't know that. She felt it was her job to keep an eye on us.

In that old house, we used the upstairs only for storage. For some reason, Mom didn't want to go up there and I wasn't allowed up there either. It wasn't until Tippy started barking at the foot of the stairs that Mom got the scare of her life. She told me to stay downstairs and she would be back in a minute. I didn't want her to go alone, but she insisted. After a few minutes, I called to her and got no answer.

I called again, ""Mom!"" Finally, she made her way slowly down the stairs, her face white and eyes fixed on nothing, said ""Come, Brenda, let's get out of here for a while..."" We quickly put on our coats, got my brother, and left. When my father came home, she said, ""Pete, we have to look for somewhere else to live. I saw a woman upstairs today. It's not safe for the kids here. Tippy went crazy and now I know why..."" We moved shortly after, but whatever it was followed us and the dog knew it.

Our new neighbor, Lola, often came over and walked in after calling, ""Yahoo..."" Then one day we heard footsteps on the porch and the door open; we didn't think a thing about it. Tippy started to growl and bark; suddenly we knew it wasn't Lola. No one was there. Over a cup of coffee to settle her nerves, Mom told Lola about the footsteps. She laughed, ""Oh, it's likely just the ghost of the old man who used to live here. Don't worry about it, he wouldn't hurt a flea...""

But just like before, the dog started barking for no reason, wouldn't leave our sides, and looked at someone we couldn't see. Then it happened again. She was back. Mom lost her patience and said, ""What in the name of God do you want?"" Of course there was no answer, but she never bothered us again. Did we live in peace after that? Yes, until we moved again.

Gold Rush Ghosts Chronicles: Things Can Get Spooky in Elk Grove,"California, United States",Ghost Hunting,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Ghost Hunting :: Gold Rush Ghosts Chronicles: Things Can Get Spooky in Elk Grove

T he day started off like any other day. There is rain outside, my dogs Pika and T-Rex are begging for their walk. They don't care if it rains or not. Sigh. But, I had to hold off on their walk. It was time to meet the paranormal group known as Gold Rush Ghosts. I met up with the team of Gold Rush Ghosts at an undisclosed location, where we conducted a meeting in regard to the upcoming investigations today. I said investigations in plural, because there are two investigations that will be conducted today. The first one is a private residence. The occupants and the residence are to remain confidential. I interviewed one of the occupants, a lovely long haired blonde woman with a statuesque pose when she enters the room. As I surveyed the Gold Rush Ghosts team, I did a mental roll call. Present for the investigations today are the following paranormal investigators: Nancy Bradley - Celebrity Psychic; Robert Reppert - Lead Investigator; Chris Grissom; Rodney Roberts; Paul Dale Roberts; Catherine Noble; Maria Muzzy; Danielle Carpenter; Liz Harrison; Millieanne Jackson; Renee Miller and Layne Miller. Wow! A very capable team to accomplish any challenges that we may face this day. Speaking of which... The day today is Sunday, January 27, 2008.

Now to my interview with the blonde haired woman occupant. She tells me that her neighbor across the street lives in a haunted home. The neighbors originally lived in a haunted home in Red Bluff, California. When they brought certain objects over from their old home to their new home, it appeared that the entities followed them to their new home. At times the neighbors from across the street have paid visits with the occupants of the haunted home we are investigating. She tells me that during family events, there has been many pictures taken inside of her home and she never captured any orb pictures. About 3 1/2 months ago, she started capturing orb pictures, which she thought was unusual. Then she tells me the fun began, here is what she relates to me.

1. Her husband makes sure that all of the lights are off in the house, he cannot sleep if even one light is on. One night at 3am, they both woke up, because the kitchen light came on by itself.

2. Her husband while laying in bed, heard a woman's voice shout his name 2 inches from his exposed ear. At the time, his wife was not at home. There was no one else in the house.

3. One of their dogs acts crazy around the house and acts like he is chasing some unknown entity within the house.

4. A mysterious blue light radiated the bedroom for a period of 2 seconds. They could not find the origin of the light source.

5. A pair of shoes was found on the computer room chair. Both of them, do not at anytime leave shoes on the chair. Now here is the interesting part. The shoes were given to them by their neighbors as a gift. These are the neighbors that live in a haunted home across the street from them. The shoes when given to them as a gift, was given to them 3 1/2 months ago, the same time as when the activity started. I was eyeing these pair of shoes and thinking I could sell them on ebay as haunted shoes, going price...hmmmm...$5,000.00. Okay, let me get off my money making schemes and concentrate on the investigation.

As we set up video cameras throughout the house, the orb activity started immediately. We had orbs flying out of the bathroom, through doors. We had a lot of orb activity in the closet. We had orbs that moved right, then left, hover and fly up. We had orbs that seemed to follow certain people. This was all captured on various video cameras. Without digital cameras, we captured many orbs, we even captured 2 dark orbs that seem to cling to the wall and moved 1 foot down, to be captured again on film. We took one picture of Robert Reppert and there seemed to be an orb that sat on his shoulder. Robert captured an odd EVP, which sounded like an unusual rustling noise and there was nothing around to make that rustling noise. All of the evidence from this house investigation will be analyzed and placed on the Gold Rush Ghosts website.

When we left this private residence, we convoyed over to the Elk Grove Brewery. We set up cameras to tape Nancy Bradley's paranormal show and Nancy and I, conducted interviews with the employees. The employees interviewed were: Staci Honey, Nicole Grogan, Heather Loft, Danica Beardsley and Keturah Lowe. Danica and Keturah have only been working at the Brewery for a short period of time and have not experienced anything paranormal yet. The stories that Heather, Staci and Nicole relate are everything from hearing a baby crying. They tell me at times, their chefs have felt presences in the kitchen area. Some patrons who claim the ability of clairvoyance, have detected the presence of entities. One of the employees said she was grabbed at the waist by a ghost with a strong grip, she suspected it was a male entity. In the ladies' room strange creaking noises have been heard. One of the weirdest experiences is when a female patron went into the lady's room, she saw eyes staring at her, when she frantically left the lady's room, the eyes followed her out to the bar. Some employees feel like they are being watched. Some employees say that they have seen moving darting shadowy figures. Nancy using her psychic abilities, picked up on an entity named Margie. Nancy describes the entity as being 5' 5"" or 5' 7"". Nancy says that she has gray hair and it's tied up into a ball. The entity has a cute round face, eyes that sparkle. The entity is also heavy set or possibly big bone and is wearing an old fashioned apron with pink designs. As Nancy walked around she was picking up on Margie's last name, it starts with a 'C' and could be possibly an Italian last name. As Nancy concentrated, images flashed in her mind. Images of Margie coming to America on a boat. While Margie was on this boat, she was afraid of the water. All of Margie's belongings were placed in a chest. Margie adored the contents of the chest and the chest itself. Margie's intention was to be a hand maid in America, but instead she found herself working in the kitchen. Nancy gathered that Margie came over at the age of 16 and died when she was 54. Margie was planning to settle down with a family in San Francisco, but instead found herself in Sacramento, after the family moved. One of Margie's specialties was skinning snakes and cooking them. The eating of snakes could have been one of her delicacies.

As Nancy picked up on the information on Margie, she later picked up on the energy of a short man that happens to follow one of the cook's around. When Nancy focuses on something with her psychic abilities, her eyes are focused on the unseen object. You can actually follow Nancy's eyes as she sees things that we can't see. As the Gold Rush Ghosts investigative teams were on their assignments, the employees allowed us to investigate the upstairs areas and the basement. The team has so far taken pictures of various orb activity. There is one photograph that shows an orb splitting into two separate orbs. The EVPs have not been fully analyzed yet and I will let Robert Reppert place that information in our FINDINGS and CONCLUSIONS.

One of the investigators had a fully charged camera and the batteries instantly drained. A possible source of this problem is when an entity or entities take the energy from a power source, such as batteries.

We had two great investigations today and I am looking forward to the results of this investigation. This is where I let Robert take it away. Robert?

ROBERT REPPERT'S FINDINGS: When we arrived at the first location, I started to take photographs of the site. First to show the lay out of the site and then to see if any orb activity would appear. To my surprise I was able to catch two Dark Orbs in one room of the residence. A Dark Orb is where the orb absorbs the light of the flash and does not reflect it back to the camera. I was also able to catch some light blue orbs around the shoes that were presented to us. Upon further investigation with Infrared cameras we were able to capture the orb activity moving around the shoes first. We then moved the camera to different places around the home. Upon placing the camera in the master closet, We were able to view a flurry of Orb activity and also abnormally high EMF readings. I was finally lucky enough to catch an EVP around the shoes that we are enhancing as we speak. We then moved on to the Brewery.

My Main Job at the Brewery was to film the interviews with Nancy, Paul, and the staff of the Brewery but I also got to do some filming in the building as well. The Basement: this area of the building has been reported as having the sound of a baby crying. Upon entering the basement I could feel the heavy air hanging around me but I heard no sounds of infants. Our team of investigators were able to get an array of orb photos and a few EVPs. We could not get most of the building dark enough to use our nightshot and infrared cameras. On a technical note, I could indentify that the building looked to be constructed around the late 1800's or the early 1900's and it appeared to have had a store on the main level and possibly rooms for rent on the top floor which is consisitant with that era. The brick building sits in which was the center of old Elk Grove with only one other brick building that sits to the West of it.

ROBERT REPPERT'S CONCLUSION: The fact that several people have heard the infant crying, warrants some deeper research into what this building may have been in the past as well as it's occupants. The main areas of sightings were reported to be the basement, the kitchen, and the Lady's bathroom. With the initial investigation over, I can conclude that the brewery has many reports of activity and deserves further probing into it's activity. The private residence has proven to us to have spirit activity. We have encouraged the occupants to enjoy the energy and that there is nothing to fear about the activity. The evedence shows that there is someone or something that likes to be at this place.

Coldness at Buttermilk,"North Carolina, United States",Demons / Possessions / Exorcisms,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Demons / Possessions / Exorcisms :: Coldness at Buttermilk

I want to share with everyone about the experience that changed my life. I had been a ghost hunter for 7 months and was getting a team together. My team was called G.A.P.S. This stands for Ghostly Appalachian Paranormal Society. I've studied the paranormal for a couple years and thought I could handle anything out there in the ""other world"". Well, I was wrong.

I learned a lesson that if you play with fire, yeah, you will get burned. There is a place called Buttermilk. I had been to this place four times already, each time with different people. This time I was with one guy and 3 other girls. The 'story' of this place is that a man died from freezing to death while hunting. He had no coat and story goes that your coat will get tugged on if you are there. This place is one road that leads 2 ways. It is a thick, wooded area that is used mainly for hunting bear.

One family lives at the end of the right side of the road. This is how we got permission to ghost hunt here. Okay, so it's almost dark. Our team had been walking around the road, taking pictures, listening for anything, and we decided to provoke. I had the most terrible feeling inside me. I told my main partner about my feeling. She shrugged it off. We start walking one by one through the area where the spirit is said to remain. Nothing happens with the 3 girls. The guy walks through and says his coat just got tugged in the back. So, it's my turn now. I was wearing my husband's coat ~ lucky me... I walked through and my coat got tugged right below my right shoulder blade. I tell everyone.

My main partner gets her dossing rods and starts asking questions. I do not take much part in this. I didn't provoke with the group because the feeling inside me almost made me get sick. I was just scouring the woods for wild animals. I'm scared to death of wild animals, but, I tried to keep this fear inside. A cold spot comes out of nowhere near our group in the middle of the dirt road. We all feel it. It grows in size and becomes colder. I felt my coat get tugged on again in the same spot. I told everyone. The guy of the group got his coat tugged on again too. The temperature felt as if it had dropped to around 20 degrees or below and it was fall and the actual temperature was near 60 degrees. Of course it was nightfall, but, the temperature never dropped below 40 degrees the entire month.

We followed this cold spot for around 10 minutes or so while she used her rods. I felt someone grab my right arm, right above my elbow. I looked to see and there was no one there to my right. I immediately let everyone know that I just got grabbed and told them where. When my coat was touched in the spot where I felt something grab me, it felt very hot. I kept touching my coat in this spot because it was so hot feeling and so strange. I told one of the girls to touch it and she said it felt hot to her too. I was telling everyone that I was freezing and ready to go. Nobody wanted to leave except me. I became numb. I had never been so cold in my life. I beg to leave and finally they agree. No one was cold like me for some reason.

So, I get home after a car ride that seemed like forever. I told my husband how cold I was and I was feeling very run down. It was late, close to midnight and I could not sleep. I felt like something was inside me taking my life. It was horrible. I felt very sad, very isolated and angry at the same time. I cried myself to sleep.

When I woke up the next morning, I was very sick. I couldn't hardly talk. I was out of my head even. I was so cold and numb. I curled up over the heater and could not even feel the heat. I asked God to help me rid myself of this demon. I tried to cast it out by yelling at it to leave and never come back. I finally called a priest and after going to church, I felt much better.

Still, to this very day, I cannot get hot. I stay cold, especially my fingertips and toes. I know this is long and I don't want to use too much space, so, if you have any questions or comments, please feel free to ask/share and I will reply. Thanks for reading!

Elderly Lady on my Road,Canada,Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: Elderly Lady on my Road

I am a first nation that lives on a reservation and there is a house on my road that used to belong to an elderly lady before I was born. I always bike that way to school because it is the fastest way and never felt danger from this lady. I asked my dad who this house belonged to. He told me her name which I cannot remember. He said she told everyone that she does not want anyone living in there or anyone tearing it down. So everyone just left it there.

It is pretty beat up by now and really creepy looking. Sometimes as I bike there the door that fell out of place I can see a shadowy figure on a rocking chair. Usually I would rub my eyes and she would be gone along with the chair. Sometimes I can see someone looking out the window. I know for a fact no one would live there. I would also see a car coming in my direction while I am biking but its to late to pull on the brakes. Although I will come out fine and the car would be gone. I have no idea if the car has anything to do with the lady but it still scares me.

Lately the car hasn't really shown to scare the living daylights out of me and the lady and her rocking chair shows up once in a while. Sometime I would like to investigate during the night time but that will have to wait because my bedtime is 10:30 or 11:00.

Wiseman's View Ghosts,"North Carolina, United States",Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: Wiseman's View Ghosts

I f you are from NC you have probably heard the story of the Brown Mountain Lights. There are many different versions that are probably irrelevant to my experience but that's beside the point.

About a year ago, 4 of my friends and I were at Wiseman's View off the Blue Ridge Parkway. We decided to go up there without flash lights or lanterns. We had walked the whole trail and went to the ledge to watch the lights. We watched them for about an hour. It was close to midnight so it was completely dark except for the lights in the valley and our cell phones. My boyfriend and his friend and I were cold and tired of watching the lights so we headed back to the jeep, leaving the other 2 people behind.

We were walking up the trail, Heather was a few feet in front of Justin and me, we were walking side by side. I happened to glance over and I saw 2 green eyes, standing about 6 feet in the air. I screamed so Justin looked over and saw them too. We yelled for Heather and we all took off running back to the jeep.

We got in and locked the doors waiting for Chris and Lacy. We waited for about half an hour and they still hadn't made it back. We were starting to worry that they had fell off the ledge or the ""eyes"" had got them. Out of nowhere we saw them running and screaming toward the jeep. We unlocked the doors and let them in.

Before I told them what we saw, they told us they saw the exact same thing in the exact same place. We didn't have cell phone service so there was no way someone could have let them know about what we saw. On the way back down the road I kept looking in the woods and I could see the eyes. I'm pretty sure it wasn't an animal and I know I wasn't seeing things because everyone else saw it too. What could it have been?

A few weeks later, I went back to Wiseman's View. We went in the daylight this time because we were to scared to go at night. We were sitting at the ledge telling ghost stories about people falling off that very ledge and dying. It a long drop. Probably close to half a mile or so. As we were talking, I happened to look down and I saw, or thought I saw, someone off another ledge about 30 feet down. It's impossible to get to that ledge without using some type of climbing equipment. I don't know if I was just letting my imagination get to me or what.

There are also stories about people killing themselves up that trail because not many people go there. My step mom was telling me a story about when her son went to ASU in Boone. There was a guy that went to school with him that had disappeared. The cops were getting desperate so they called in a psychic investigator. Wiseman's View is about an hour from the campus, but the psychic told the police right away that they would find their answers there.

When they got there, he was hanging from a tree about 40 feet in the air. I saw that tree and to me, it looks impossible for someone to climb. I don't know if that part of the story was made up or if it was real, but I did read the article about the student. They said it was suicide, but if he was really hanging from that tree, he had help from something.

I could go on for days about the stories from Wiseman's View, but I think you get the picture. Could the same thing be causing all the deaths or could they be completely unrelated?

My Ouija Board Experience,Puerto Rico,Ouija Board / Seances,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Ouija Board / Seances :: My Ouija Board Experience

I 've been reading the stories on this site for quite a while now. The reason I do so is because I have always experienced paranormal activity. There are many stories that I could write about, but I decided to start with this one because I just read one of the latest stories and it is about a Ouija Board. Every time that I read or hear anything about Ouija Boards, it gets me very tense because I'm reminded of my own experience.

I was born and raised in Puerto Rico, on the south west coast. When I was about 15 years old, we had a neighbor that had several teenage kids and they owned one of these boards. But, before I get to the story, please be patient as I tell you of the background to the story.

Ever since I was a little kid, I've had three recurring dreams. They're all very vivid and very painful. In fact, I can't believe I'm writing this as I have only told of this dream to one other person in my whole life. In this dream, I'm walking down a street made of cobblestones. It is somewhat cold as I pass this glass window where I see my reflection. When I look at myself, I'm a man wearing an uniform that I now know to be German SS. I continue walking until I reach an intersection and I look towards a smaller street to my right. There is a family being held at gun point. I realize that one of the members of the family is my girlfriend and I run down the street, trying to stop the inevitable. Before I get to them, the soldier shoots the young woman in the head. That's when I wake up, always crying.

Needless to say, this is a very disturbing dream and I think I was six when I had it for the first time! As I got older, and I studied history, I became even more horrified of this dream, which, by the way, I still experience every so often. It is a dream that haunts me, not only because the murder is so clear and gory, but because of the reflection I see. That ideology is about as far away from who I am as you can get!

So, going back to the story, this particular summer night, we sat outside, playing dominos and cards for a while, sitting at a small table. My friend, Sara, decided that she wanted to use this Ouija Board. I thought that it was all stupid, but I went along. After about ten minutes, I was getting bored with it, thinking that one of them was moving it. Then, Sara asked the Board if it had a message for me. At this point, all the hair on my neck raised up and suddenly I felt very uncomfortable. The Board started moving and it spelled ""NAZI"". Needless to say, I became terrified. That dream was my secret and I had never told anyone! I then knew that the thing must be for real and it knew about my dream! I let go of it right away, stood up and stepped away from the table.

My friends, stunned at what the Board spelled, looked at me and let go of it as well. Unfortunately for us, this wasn't the end. The thing went berserk and spun several times very fast until it dropped on the sidewalk... All on its own! We all screamed and ran to our homes. My mom, who is a very religious person, scolded me for playing with the board.

After that, weird things started happening in both houses, ours and theirs. My brother became haunted by apparitions and nightmares on a regular basis and for years after that. I saw things and had some experiences that were very unpleasant. My mother never admitted it, but she also sensed stuff. She even asked someone from her church to come and bless the house. It didn't work! As a mater of fact, things got worse for a while. My parents still live there and when I go to visit (I left the island many years ago and live in the United States now after traveling all over Europe and living in Hawaii) I can still sense something there.

So, every time I read one of those Ouija stories, I get very concerned for the ones writing them. Ouija Boards are very dangerous and I won't come near one even if someone with a lot of experience and knowledge is using it.

As for my dream, I lived In Germany for 3 years. I joined the Army and did everything I could to get assigned there and was successful. I admit it was because I was hoping to make sense of the dream. Every time I visited a large city (in the dream the feeling I get is that of a large city) I looked very carefully to see if I could find the street in my dream. I think I found it in Munich. Perhaps now that others know of this dream, it will be somewhat of a relief. But, it still freaks me out to think that whatever entity spoke through the board that night, knew about it.

Warning by Phone,"Nebraska, United States",Psychic / Medium,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Psychic / Medium :: Warning by Phone

I have written a few other stories regarding my office and the strange occurrences within the building and around it. Well, this last week and a half have been right up there!

I have a private office with a private phone line that also can receive calls from the entire business, one of those mega telephone business systems. On my telephone there is a built in caller identification. For calls coming from outside of the building it will display only the number. For calls coming from inside the building, it will display the person's name as well as extension number. I try to leave my door open, promote the open door policy and keep tabs on what is going on in the building. It can sometimes get noisy, and then I close the door to concentrate.

The Administrative Assistant and I have become pretty close friends. Her office is caddy-corner to mine. I can sometimes hear voices from her office when my door is open, not conversations but voices.

A few days ago, I was sitting at my desk and I heard a female's voice say ""Help her. Watch out for her. She will need you"". It was not a voice I recognized, but I got up, looked down the hall. Nobody there. I checked all of the near by offices, no one there either. Okay, scratch the head and move on.

The day after that, I heard the females voice coming from my phone, stating the exact same thing. ""Help her. Watch out for her. She will need you..."" My phone only rings on my end for incoming calls. I looked at the display while hearing the voice, it displayed the Admins extension and name, and then disconnected. I immediately called her and asked if she had tried to reach me. She said no, she was in the middle of something. I let it go at that.

The next day the voice through the phone occurred a couple of times, then a few times over the next few weeks. The calls did not occur at specific times, but, they always displayed the Admin's name and extension number. I had asked her about it a couple of times, always getting a no for an answer. The calls also come when there is no one in her office. The strangest thing is my phone NEVER rings for these calls.

I took Friday off. When I returned to work I had learned the Admin had an asthma attack in her office. The door had been closed and she passed out before getting to the handle to open the door and get help. She was discovered by maintenance that saw a shadow against the door of her office and opened to investigate. A rescue squad was called; she was taken to the nearest ER for treatment.

Monday I was listening to some old tapes of previously recorded seminars. The voice from the calls was on the tape conducting the seminar! I asked an employee who has been here for quite some time who the voice belonged to. I was told the voice belonged to a former Admin who had passed away about five years ago. I went back to listening to the seminars. Still a bit bewildered. As I was leaving the media room, I turned and saw a woman with short cropped brown hair, glasses in a navy business suit smiling in my direction. She exited through the opposite side door.

As I returned the seminar tapes, I looked at the cover on one of the tapes. It was the Admin who had passed away, she had taped the seminars. She was the woman standing in the media room smiling at me!

I wonder if she was trying to warn me about the current Admins asthma attack?

Haunted Baby Grave,"Michigan, United States",Psychic / Medium,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Psychic / Medium :: Haunted Baby Grave

T his took place in Michigan at a grave yard that my Mom and Dad are laid to rest at. In the mid 1980's. I always just kind of felt at peace there, (no pun here intended) and would often go to this grave yard to just walk around. When I was real stressed out and look to see what grave was the oldest. The newest people laid to rest to see if I knew them.

I came across the one side of the grave yard where all the babies are buried. They would always make me cry thinking of all these innocent little lives that, the Lord took to Heaven to help him out with spiritual Angels.

I was walking between the graves at the names of these little Angels. I just happen to step on a grave and down my foot went. Now I was frighten the grave sank into the ground. And when I went to pull my foot out, which was I would say just over my ankle, would not come out as if something was holding onto me. I looked down to expect to see a tiny hand grasping my leg, but I seen nothing.

My heart is in over drive beating so hard and fast. I looked down at that grave and said a prayer for this little Angel that was an infant just days old that died. The grasp let go of my leg and I took off out of there into my car and vowed I would not return there ever.

That last for a few days staying away. When I got to sleep at night I went back to this grave to this little Angel. This baby was trying to get my attention for some reason. I would wake up crying. So one day I went back to this same little grave. For some reason I could not stay away from this grave I kept going back and saying prayers and going back and saying prayers for this baby.

In the day time I could not stop thinking about this baby. That this baby needed something, but I could not figure out what it could be. It had a head stone that said the babies name on it and birth and death. It was recently new and did tell the funeral home it came from.

So I went to the funeral home talked to the director and said ""I know your going to think I am insane but..."" And I told him what happen the first day I was at the grave yard, and the dreams I kept having and I felt that the baby needed me for some reason.

He told me that did not surprise him in his business he has seen, heard and felt a lot and that was not a surprise. He told me he could not tell me anything else about this baby without the consent of the parents or at least the Mother of this baby. I told him I understood. He did say he would contact her and see what she said. I said okay.

Sometime later he called me up. The Mother didn't care that I knew what happen to her baby but she didn't want her name known. I said great when can I come by. Later that afternoon he met me at the grave of this tiny baby. I held flowers in my hand to put on the grave as it had none on it.

The funeral director told me that the Mother of this child, never wanted this child, never held this child in her arms. And that this child died from ""SIDS"". Tears are dripping down my face into the ground where this baby was laying. It felt like a flood of tears (still teary eyed now writing this) coming down my face. I asked the funeral director to hold the flowers he did. I bent down to the open hole in the grave where my shoe went through, and lifted this baby out (in my mind) and cradled this tiny baby in my arms. While I sang to this baby I love you and that you will not be forgotten you can rest now. I kissed this baby I cradled in my arms. Then put this baby back into it's place of rest. I took the flowers from the director and place them near the stone.

The director left and I stood their crying and praying that this child could find peace now. I felt a calm come over me like none other that I ever felt. I knew this babies spirit knew it was loved, had been held by a loving person, and knew this baby was important to at least someone. While I lived in that area I brought flowers to the babies grave at least once a month.

When I did that I prayed for this baby. After all this was done. I took some dirt from the house and filled in the hole in the ground that my foot made in which I planted a flower into it.

I kept going back to the grave yard more often to this baby in which my heart had adopted and prayed, sang, sometimes I would reach down to the grave on the ground pick this baby up hold this baby in my arms and cradle it and gently place back in it's bed.

Then I was going to relocate. I went back to the grave told this baby that I would be moving far away and would not be back to often but when I did come back I would hold, sing and pray. Tears dripped down my face as I am saying this. Tears of Love for this child that I would not be able to visit the grave, but also tears knowing this babies soul was at rest now. Kissed this baby and left the grave yard.

I went back to that area many times the first seven years when I relocated here where I live now. I kept my promise with flowers and the rest. Then I got into a bad car accident, and I can't drive far anymore. But maybe this summer I can have one of my children take me out there to this babies grave. Where I can sing, pray and tell this baby that I still love it so. This way this babies soul will still feel loved.

To me this all meant, this babies soul wanted to know that someone loved it, living or dead. And once I showed my love for this babies soul, this baby was at rest.

A Bored Ghost Named Bill,"Montana, United States",Old Hags / Night Attacks / Sleep Paralysis,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Old Hags / Night Attacks / Sleep Paralysis :: A Bored Ghost Named Bill

I recently went to Bozeman, Montana to visit my brother and his fiance, in a house that they are renting until their new house is completed. Before going to bed the first night I was there, they warned me (jokingly, I thought) that I should be aware of the ghost in the house. I've always been a bit skeptical when it comes to the supernatural, at least in regards to them being able to have actual contact with us.

Kind of spooked, I went to bed, first with the light on. After waking up around 3am, I decided it was silly to keep the light on, and decided to shut it off. Laying in the dark, I couldn't fall asleep. Tossing around, I ended up on my back staring at the ceiling. Within moments, I heard a low tone, as if someone had turned on an electrical switch on a radio or something. My body was overwhelmed with vibrations from head to toe, which continued to go up and down my body during the experience to follow.

At first, along with the tone, I heard the incoherent mumbling of a man's voice. I tried to say ""OK,"" as if to assure the ghost I wanted to hear what they had to say. Nothing came out except air and my own incoherent voice. I kept trying to say ""OK,"" then decided to ask, ""What are you doing here?"" Again, I struggled to make any sense, all that came out were my gasps and grunts.

What followed still gives me chills. After I tried to speak, I saw the appearance of a man at the side of my bed, close to my feet. He was wearing a button down shirt tucked into pants, and his hands were in his pant pockets. I could also see his face, he looked like a man in his sixties, with little or no hair. He then said, ""Well, I was just up here, so..."" and that was it. Note that I was in the upstairs bedroom at the time, and the only one upstairs that night. When he spoke, his lips were illuminated slightly more than the rest of his body.

After he spoke, he was gone and the vibrations and tone stopped. I have since read a bit about sleep paralysis, which has made me question whether or not I was actually awake when the encounter happened. Before reading all of those articles, I had no doubt in my mind that I was awake and fully aware of my body at the time, how I was trying to speak, and how clear the image of this man was. The experience was so physically overwhelming that I can't believe that it has some scientific, non-supernatural explanation.

After speaking to my brother and his fiance about the situation, they related their similar experiences. About a week earlier, she had heard a man's voice saying, ""Uh, this is Bill?"" as well as experiencing the same vibrating/frozen physical feelings. Their bed had and continued to vibrate at all times of the day before, during, and after my stay with them. My brother's fiance had also heard a woman's voice one night, who said, ""Look at her lips,"" referring to my future sister-in-law's trembling mouth while she was again incapacitated and trying to speak.

Needless to say my trip, which was supposed to be centered around snowboarding, good eating, and visiting with family, ended up centered around Bill and his companion(s) in the house. I'm definitely not a skeptic anymore.

Ghosts I've Roomed With,"Idaho, United States",Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: Ghosts I've Roomed With

I n the summer of 2004, I moved with my husband and 2-year-old daughter from Wyoming to Pocatello, Idaho. The apartment we moved into was actually a house that was built sometime in the 1920's and had been converted into three apartments. We lived in the downstairs apartment on the left-hand side. We had only been there for a few weeks when weird things started happening.

At first, they were pretty benign and easily explained away, such as objects disappearing inexplicably only to reappear in the exact location I had left them. There were also strange noises, especially at night. I would hear the sound of children laughing and running in the upstairs apartment, when I knew for a fact that the only children who lived in the apartment were my own and my neighbor did not have any visitors.

Most of the time, when I heard these sounds, my neighbor wasn't even home. I have always had a fascination with the paranormal so it wasn't difficult for me to believe that ""spirits"" were responsible, but my husband is a very practical person and continued to insist that there were ""perfectly logical"" explanations for everything.

His opinion changed a few months later when he witnessed the first of many physical manifestations. We would often return home to find an entire roll of toilet paper had been unraveled from the roll and was lying on the floor. At first, my husband blamed our dog, but I knew there was no way our five-pound chihuahua could reach the toilet paper roll.

This went on for some time and was very frustrating, as no scientific explanation could be given for it. Then one day, my husband was shaving in the bathroom when the roll began to spin on its own. He watched, dumbfounded, as it went round and round and the toilet paper piled up on the floor. It was after this incident that we began to suspect that the spirit in our apartment was a mischievous child. This seemed even more probable after our friend Samantha brought over one of her acquaintances who just happened to be psychic sensitive. He had no previous knowledge of the apartment or of the strange goings-on that had been occurring, but he nevertheless informed me that he saw a little girl with dark hair and a ""filly"" blue dress standing in the corner of our living room. He seemed very un-nerved by the whole experience and was anxious to leave. I myself never saw a visual specter, but had felt a ""presence"" on numerous occasions.

The child ghost didn't bother us much, aside from the occasional mischievous unraveling of a toilet-paper roll, but there was another presence in the house that was very different. I perceived it to be male and not very friendly. It only seemed to bother me, for some reason, and always when my husband was not in the room.

One night, I was lying in bed, half-asleep. My husband was in the living room, playing video games. My eyes were closed, but I clearly heard heavy footsteps moving through the kitchen. They stopped at the doorway of our bedroom and I heard my husband's voice say my name. ""What?"" I said, without opening my eyes. There was no answer, so I rolled over and sat up and looked towards the doorway. There was no one there, but there was something there. Even in the dark, I could make out a shadowy form that appeared to be leaning against the doorway. I knew then that it was not my husband and became very frightened. I told the thing to go away and leave me alone, and it vanished abruptly. I ran into the living room to find my husband sitting on the couch, as he had been during the entire incident. He had not heard the footsteps or seen anything unusual, but he saw how scared I was and knew better than to tell me it was just my imagination.

It disturbed me that the ""spirit"" knew my name and had spoken to me using my husband's voice, as if it were trying to trick me. A friend suggested that perhaps the shadowy form might have been my ""spirit guide"", but I rejected that explanation. Whatever it was, I did not get a good feeling from it. I started looking for another place to live shortly thereafter.

After we had found a suitable apartment, we began packing to leave. The spirits made it very clear that they were not happy to see us go. On the final day that we lived there, I was packing my book collection into boxes in the living room when a curtain rod was ripped loose from the wall and came hurtling down at my head. Luckily, I wasn't hurt, but I easily could have been as the screw that fastened it to the wall was still jutting out of it. My husband examined both the rod and the hole in the wall and confirmed that it had been pulled out of the wall, rather than merely ""coming loose"" and falling.

That was that. We finished packing and left as quickly as we could, but not before I said a prayer for the spirits that we were leaving behind.

The Love that Changed Him,"Nevada, United States",Poltergeists / Physical Manifestations,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Poltergeists / Physical Manifestations :: The Love that Changed Him

M y name is Theresa, I am currently 15 and I was 13 when this all started. It was about 6 months after moving into our new house. It was a mobile home, an old one. It had its problems but it was good. I had just got into my own room, and immediately I started experiencing ""mishap"".

My closet was fairly large, and it had sliding doors with glass on them, so they were rolling mirrors. I didn't know back then that mirrors are a sort of gateway for the dead. I had mirrors hanging all over my room, to make it seem bigger than it was. I had an Ouija board that a couple weeks previously, after a failed half-hearted attempt to use it with my mom, had begun to glow green. It was inside the original box, which was doing the glowing. It's a second-hand board so maybe it was a still-open portal... I don't know.

After getting moved into my room the glass mirrors on the closet would shake with no explanation. I would ask it to stop or take some note that ""I know you're in my room"" and it would stop. Also, I would experience drafts in my room for no reason. One of the scarier happenings was, everyday, I would hear something punching the walls. Sometimes multiple times in a row.

When I would go to bed every night I would experience my bed shaking, and I could not recreate it. It was almost like someone standing and physically shaking the bed. Also, the most disturbing thing, was getting things thrown at me and getting hurt. I still have scars from some cuts left on my arms, and on more than one occasion I would experience my headphones being thrown at me, among other things, such as my keyboard.

My mother told me of something that happened to her as well, in the kitchen. She was talking to my little sister and out of no where the ""something"" kicked the refrigerator so hard it jumped and moved a couple inches. Another instance of the ""something"" was when I was on vacation, she called the hotel one night and told us that she was hearing stomping and banging and things flinging around. I simply told her ""It's Kalav and Danice"", Kalav being the entity I was having problems with and Danice being my friend's.

After a while I began to befriend the ""something"", not knowing that he (Kalav) was really a demon. Even after finding out, I blew it off and pretended he was just another spirit.

I later found out, after moving out of the mobile home, that he's an Incubus, and a very high-ranking demon. I have come to meet many demons, such as Danice (who is a Neqa'el, an Egyptian cat demon) and Nickki (Familiar demon, who also appears as a cat). Kalav, as testified by my little brother, also appears as an overlarge black dog.

Kalav is about seven feet tall, with black hair going to his ankles. He came from Britain, and he doesn't have any eyes. I'm not sure how old he is, but he's a Fallen Angel who was with Lucifer at the time of The Fall.

I must admit to having falling in love with him. Knowing full well what I've gotten into, I believe deep down that he's a good person.

I know several people who have had similar ghost stories and who have met Kalav. Although my parents believe he and the rest are all figments of my imagination.

The Side Room in the Church,"Michigan, United States",Psychic / Medium,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Psychic / Medium :: The Side Room in the Church

T his happen in lower Michigan. In the 1990's. I kept passing this pretty Church as I would drive to the store or home. One day I called and talked to a lady name Dottie, told her I was new in the area, and I would like to know what time the services were there. She told me and then told me about the Church that it was rather old but well kept up.

The Church was the kind that you would be likely to see on a Christmas card. I often thought of that when I went by the Church. All white with a big steeple on the top. Just by looking at it you could tell it was an old Church.

Dottie told me it has been many domination of religion since it was originality built over a hundred years ago. She told me that additions had been added in the years the Church was there on the same ground. I told her I liked how it looked inviting. She said I was welcome to come to services anytime. And about the pot luck they had there every 3rd Saturday, that may be a good time to come and to meet the people of the Church. Dottie gave me her phone number and told me when I felt comfortable to come she meet me at Church so I would not be going there and not know anyone. I told her thanks and left.

A couple of months went by and I did call Dottie and she said she would meet me out front and what time. I told her a time and she was right where she said she would be when I arrived. We went into the Church it was very old fashion with seats you would see at an old theater, that would pull out and once you got up they flipped back into place. It was plain but I felt a welcome feeling at the Church.

After Church services we went down to the basement where the fellowship was taking place. It was someone birthday and so there was a cake and drinks to munch on. Dottie introduced me to many people and they all welcomed me to the Church.

I went many times to this Church. Then one Sunday, Dottie said she had to put some food and non food stuff into the side room where people of the community could come and get when they needed the items. She asked if I like to help her. I said sure. We went down in the basement to the side room off the fellowship room. Soon as I entered the room it was very cold. I said ""it's cold in here"" she said ""yeah it probably was"". She open the door wide to let in the warmth that was in the fellowship room.

Soon Dottie told me she was warmed up ""how about you?"" I said I was still cold that I didn't feel good in this room. Dottie said ""you will get use to it"". I said ""what do you mean"" she just smiled at me as we unpacked the items and put in places they went to in the side room. Then it was like something was trying to take all the air out of me. I was trying to catch my breath and it felt like it was being sucked right out of me. Dottie notice and asked me ""what was wrong?"" I said ""I got to get out of this room"". As I was leaving the room I felt a presence glide by me, I left the room and sat in the fellowship room. Once I was out of the side room I felt okay.

Dottie came to me and said ""You don't look so good are you not feeling well today?"". I said I was feeling well until I went into that room. She just looked at me and I told her how I felt. She said she often felt cold in there even when it was very hot in the fellowship room. But she just figured it was because it was the basement and thought nothing of it. Dottie did state she never felt like the air was being sucked out of her when in that room.

Once I got used to the people in the Church I would ask different people about that room and no one seemed to care or know. Many looked at me as if I was having some kind of a satan thing, going on inside of me... After that many people acted as if I didn't belong there, they didn't want nothing to do with me. So I left that Church and have not been back there for about five years

Dottie went to rest with the Lord sometime ago. She was the only one after that happen that still continued to like to be with me. We never brought up the side room again. But I have the sense that she knew exactly what I was going through that day, as she went through it herself...

Trailer and the Baby Cradle,"Michigan, United States",Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: Trailer and the Baby Cradle

T his was told to me by my nephew Jeff about his daughter in her cradle. It happen in 1988. Jeff told me this story of his daughter Leeann. He and his wife and the baby new born lived in a house trailer. The babies bedroom was at one end of the trailer and his and his wives bedroom was at the other end. In the middle of the trailer was the kitchen. With the living room and bathroom off that room.

Jeff said he woke up in the middle of the night, and needed a drink of water. He went to the sink and ran the water had a drink. After he turned off the water and drank the water, he could hear some noise coming from his daughter's bedroom. Knowing there should not be anyone in there he went in to check on his infant daughter. He looked at the cradle she was in and it was rocking, as if a hand was rocking it and his baby was asleep.

He checked the closet nothing there. He checked the window in the room it was still sealed and locked. He looked around the room and still nothing and yet that cradle was still rocking. He stated when he turn the light on the hair on the back of his neck and arms was up and it felt cold in the room. Yet it was not winter time yet, the end of the summer and still warm nights they had.

Several nights went by and he kept a watch on the babies room and nothing was happening. He settled in not thinking anymore about it. One night he woke up and felt he needed to check on his daughter so went to the room, flipped on the light the hair went up on his neck and arms and the cradle was rocking again. His daughter as usual was sound to sleep and nothing appeared to be wrong with her. He again looked in the closet and at the window nothing. He looked through out the house, still nothing he could find that was wrong.

On another night he woke up to go to the bathroom. While up he thought he check on his daughter not only did he see the cradle rocking but now, he was frightened. Learning over his daughter was a man in what appeared to be bib overalls as if he were to take the baby out of the cradle. He went to go after the man to leave his baby alone and when he got almost to the man, the man just vanished into thin air. He said he picked up his daughter and took her into the bedroom with him and his wife. He told her what had been happening and what he saw this night.

After awhile he said he put her back in her own room, in her cradle and kept a close eye on her from the living room. He got up, went into the babies room and there was that guy again. Jeff said he was frighten once again but knew what he was seeing was a ghost but didn't know why. As he went to go pick up his daughter something smell odd in the room. He picked her up and took her out of the room to be with him.

The next day when he went to the kitchen area he thought the pilot light had gone out as he smelled gas. He called the gas man and come to find out was this. Where his daughter was sleeping there was a gas leak under the room she slept in. They had it repaired. Jeff said he wanted to know about the land or the trailer that he lived in who the man was.

He found out. A couple lived long ago where this trailer park was sitting now. It was a farm house and cows. One night the house caught on fire and the father died in the fire trying to save his baby daughter. Jeff then knew that, that man was there trying to get Jeff's attention to the matter of the gas line leaking so he could save his own daughter. Something the other man could not do he perished in the fire with his daughter. Jeff went into the room thanked the man for helping him save his daughter.

Jeff said not all ghost are harmful many are there to help you. If you only pay attention to what they are trying to show you.

The Elemental of Forest,"Virginia, United States",Non Human Entities,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Non Human Entities :: The Elemental of Forest

I t was only about a year ago in late September, early October that an acquaintance and soon to be good friend of mine began talking about the band shirt I was wearing that day. We conversed through class and carried our conversation on outside. Right as we were about to depart my friend brought up what would seem like a strange topic, and to anyone that is not familiar with the paranormal it would indeed seem strange.

He mentioned the woods behind his house and the strange happenings at and around them. He mentioned noises sounding like an elephant's trumpet, screeches like those of freight train, odd feelings like one is being watched, orbs, shadows, and much more. It sounded much too good to be true so I, not knowing my new friend that much yet, asked if he drank excessively or did drugs. He told me he did not drink and has never done drugs in his life. Upon further investigating of the site and getting to know him a little better, both his assertions of his haunted woods and his drug and drink free lifestyle were indeed true. But with the haunted woods I got a little bit more than I could bargain for.

We set a day that we could stop by and investigate the woods further together, and on that day I still was apprehensive of all of what he had told me was going on. When I arrived the house was a small two story, kind of seemed old like from maybe back in the 50's with shutters and a painted a faded blue against the aging vinyl siding. The front yard had all sorts of Halloween decor with the obligatory Jack-O-Lantern, black cats, and stereotypical witches. It seemed sorta quaint in an eerie sort of way. One could barely see the woods behind the house, except for one GIGANTIC oak tree, the likes of which would dwarf any house short of a mansion.

I entered the house and we goofed off until darkness set in. I went downstairs for a drink and a smoke and was informed the fridge with the drinks was in the garage, which was convenient enough for me because the side door was strategically place next to the fridge. I grabbed my drink and stepped outside into a small chain linked area surrounding the side door. The chain linked area was small maybe 5x5 area and was contained in his already fenced yard. I believe it was something the previous owners installed to deter thieves. Regardless, I was standing in the middle and proceeded to light up. I took a few drags of the cigarette and out of no where I heard a tap-tap on the vinyl siding coming from around the corner towards the back of the house. I dismissed this as nothing but the wind or even his dogs even though the tapping seemed to come from about my height, 6 foot 2 inches.

I continued smoking, but then heard another tap-tap this time a little closer to the edge of the house. Again dismissed this as the wind or animal. I then heard another tap-tap this time closer to the edge of the house. I stopped smoking now and my eyes fixed on that corner. I then heard a SLAP-SLAP coming from RIGHT around the corner. I immediately ran in to see where everyone was to possibly catch my friend trying to play up his stories he had told earlier, only to find him sitting down upstairs on his computer. I told him the story and he explained to me of the spirit that wanders into his yard and plays tricks like that. Now, with this fresh in my mind, I had to know what else was out there.

We went outside and around his house to his back woods as we got closer and closer to the forest's edge there was just a feeling of something staring back at you from the woods and there was a strange force, akin to ""this is a bad idea"" feeling, that surrounded the perimeter of the forest. I dared not go any further into the woods and I expressed my concern to my friend where he proceeded to say we would definitely not go into the woods that it was dangerous at night (a story for another time if this one meets a good reception). We both simply walked the perimeter and suddenly something caught my mind's eye. I felt an odd sort of energy emanating from one of the trees. I told him something is different about that tree, he told me that is where he saw the little dead girl he told me about in his stories. Another odd happening, but easily rationalized away, just like earlier with the tapping. I looked away from the tree and focused down our path where I noticed a pile of wood sitting at the end of the road past a fence. I got a very odd feeling from that area when I stared at it like someone was standing there looking back as I stared into an inanimate pile of wood. This time, I kept my feeling to myself.

We ventured around further and came across a field with a low fog and he explained to me how he believes the fog is how the forest breathes. Coming from my Druid background I agreed whole-heartedly. He warned though that when the forest breathes it can also be a warning to stay away and he has noticed activity increases when there is a fog present (On a side-note the fog seems to retreat if you stare at it too long, I swear it is the weirdest thing like the forest is self-conscious).

After a chat about the fog he told me the tale of Elemental that rose from the ground and chased him and his friend back across the field. He also told of the immense speed this ""shadow"" possessed, it literally cleared a football field in a matter of seconds by zig-zagging back and forth and running on knuckles in his story. This could be an exaggeration but the detail it was told with gives me a different impression. Either way I was about to find out what he meant.

We came to the other side of the field, not by cutting across like he did in his story but coming in from the other side. There was an ominous street light adjacent to a dirt road that lead back and followed the edge of the field. As soon as we approached the dirt road the street light went out. He told me that this light has a short and is known to do this frequently. I agreed with the rationalization and we continued down the path. The farther we pushed in the more I felt the air getting dense and heavy. Then all of the sudden I froze. I believe I hit the second barrier, the first I passed by when we entered the road that ""this isn't a good idea"" feeling barrier I spoke of before. The second barrier felt like an actual wall for me. I couldn't move. I called my friend over and told him I will not move another INCH. He agreed to head back out with me. We reached the entrance again and as soon as we neared the light went out... again.

The light came back on after a few seconds, I was facing the light with my back to the entrance while my friend stood in front of me while he talked about miscellaneous stuff and I smoked. When from behind me I heard a loud POP. The only way I can describe it is either like a small item falling from a VERY large distance like the top of a tree and slamming into a bunch of twigs or a large branch snapping. I figured it was the first and asked ""What kind of trees are these?"" thinking they were pine. He replied ""Magnolia..."" I slowly stuttered ""...Magnolia's don't flower in October do they?"" and just then my friend's eyes darted up. He looked at me with the most serious expression I have ever seen. He said ""We have to leave, now..."" I was now puzzled and frightened. What happened behind my back to scare him so badly? I wanted to know but he refused to tell me.

We slowly backed away from the entrance very calmly and we took a different route back to his house. On the way back, he told me what he saw. That branch snapping was the elemental kicking off to jump, and what he saw, and I wish I could have seen too, was the elemental jumping across the street from tree to tree to get a better view of us.

We arrived back at the house fine and I have told this story many times to people familiar with these things and I was given many different responses, but one response stood out among all of the others and it had to do with the history of the woods and previous events there that I was not present for. I am willing to share all of my stories I have of these woods that I have experienced and all of the stories that I know of the woods from my close friend. I will leave with this, that the night I was there only scratched the surface of what is out there...

"A Long, Paranormal Day","California, United States",Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: A Long, Paranormal Day

T he storm roared outside. Branches and leaves were scattered all over my backyard. The house was cold and lonely, since my kids were at school and my husband was off at work. I sat at my kitchen table enjoying warm toast and coffee with my dog observing my toast carefully.

I was busy reading the newspaper when all of a sudden I hear heavy breathing on my left ear and feel cold breath on my shoulder. At that moment, my dog ran outside in the rain and started howling. Petrified, I froze. It lasted about 2 seconds and just stopped. My dog came scampering back in wet and cold so I went to go dry him off. I couldn't find an explanation for what had just happened. I shook it off and prepared for an important job interview that would be taking place later that day.

Afterwards, I was on my couch working on my laptop with my kitty asleep next to me. In the hallway, which connects to the living room, I heard loud, distinct footsteps walking towards the living room. I bravely peeked into the hallway to find nothing there. Shocked, I went back to my couch to find my cat hidden inside the fireplace with wide eyes staring into nowhere. Once again, I couldn't find an explanation for what had happened.

Finally, it was time to head to the city for my interview. I attempted to open the door to leave but it wouldn't budge. The doorknob just wouldn't let me turn it. Getting really angry, with all my might I forced the doorknob to turn. It wouldn't even move. I went to go get a hammer and basically attacked the doorknob. It didn't move whatsoever. Only a few dents but that's it. I screamed at whoever was doing this to stop right away and open the door immediately. I tried the door one more time and it opened easily. I was twenty minutes late for my interview.

I got back home around 5. My kids were home playing with our babysitter. I was exhausted. I collapsed onto my couch and had a really weird dream. I dreamt that I was swimming in a fountain with my friend. Millions of black koi fish were swirling at the edge of the fountain going in a circle. They were sucking me in and my friend was staring at me saying ""Don't let the Darkness take you! Fight back! The Darkness is trying to take you!"".

I woke up sweaty and shivering. It was exactly 6:13 pm. My cell phone was beeping. I checked it and it said: ""6 New Voicemail"". I checked the first one. The best way to describe the sound was as a static voice speaking in gibberish.

If anyone can give me explanations on anything that happened that day that would be great. Thanks for reading

A Dying Language Saved Me,Ireland,Psychic / Medium,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Psychic / Medium :: A Dying Language Saved Me

I 'm happy with the response to my other stories, yet it must be said that it hasn't been all bad with me, some encounters have just been, well, miraculous. But before I go on, I'd like to thank all those who have left me comments. I will get back to you all shortly, probably through the site or via e mail. I do promise to respond though, just been busy.

This story I'm about to write is about how the irish language saved my life when I was 15. And I've never forgotten the kind words that saved me. You all know them to. But I'll tell the story first.

My friend paul and I had just finished a great game of football in the phoenix park, and now we were sitting down on his front lawn drinking gallons of water (it was a hot August) and resting our soon to be aching bones. I stretched myself out, flat on my back and looked towards the reddening sky. Or heavens now as I call it instead of sky. I held a smoke between my lips and took a very long pull on it. Without removing the cigarette from my lips, I blew the smoke out and watched it dance towards the heavens. Then I heard the oddest thing, Irish. Not the word, the language (You should know before I continue on that only one percent of Irish speak their own language on a regular basis)

Gabh mo leithscéal (GOVV muh LAH-shkayl), An bhfuil Gaelige agat? (on will Gwhale-ga agg-ut?) Excuse me, do you speak Irish?

Sea (Shah) Yes, I responded as I propped myself up on my elbows and looked down the length of my body towards an eldery man standing at the garden gate. Who the hell are you talking to? I'd forgotten Paul was even beside me. Normally I wouldn't have responded to a ghost so quickly without first looking about, to see who was around me. Yet on this occasion I had. It made sense later.

I turned to Paul and promised to explain it to him, later on, then turned back to my visitor and asked, Conas atá tú? (CONN-us a-TAW too?) How are you?

Táim go maith, go raibh maith agat. (TAW'm guh MOH, GUH REV MOH agg-UT) I'm fine, thank you.

Paul sat looking at me as if I had twenty heads, but I continued talking to this gent, not knowing why it was so improtant that I did so, just feeling that it was.

He took a step in towards me and said Cén t-ám é? (Cane Tahm a?) Le do thoil. (Leh duh Hull) What's the time please? I looked at my watch and was just about to give it to him when he was right in front of me and shouted Bí curamach! (BEE KOOR-muk!) Look out! Paused, then said Dia is Muire Duit (DEE-a iSS MIRR-a Gwit) May God and Mary be with you. This took me by surprise. Not the fact that he was screaming at me, but, his last sentence. This is actually a greeting. It's how you say hello to someone in Irish who has already said hello to you. It was also said with a slight warning tone. Then, as usual, he was gone. I sat there a while longer looking in the direction the old man had appeared. Then I just got up, went into Paul's house and ate my dinner. The visitor had left me slightly shaken, and also warm hearted. He was a pleasant if somewhat strange visitor. I did explain to Paul my gift, who shrugged it off with disinterest, but he believes me now, as a mate would, without conviction. Its easier for some people to continue believing the world is flat.

I left his house close to ten o clock that evening, and started my long journey home. His house was located on blackhorse avenue, some 40 minutes from my home in Cabra. As I was walking (I decided to go through the park and up onto my road through Dunnard estate) I heard something moving beside me. The park is full of foxes, deer, rabbits and badgers, so I thought nothing of it. Until I heard a clicking noise/sound coming from my left. I stopped in my tracks and turned to face this obtuse sound. It certainly did not belong with the other sounds of the park. What I saw I will take to the grave. It stood 4 feet tall, sloped over, so I would guess it would be taller, and had its arms dragging on the ground. It was just an outline of course, but so very real. I took a step back and heard a small, growl I guess, that's the only way to explain it, so I stopped again. I'm done for is all I thought. This thing wasn't letting me get anywhere without it's permission. And it didn't seem like it was going to give it.

When I looked back on it later on, there wasn't any other sounds around the two of us. Everything was silent. That's when I heard the words again, Dia is Muire Duit! I remembered the old man and his warning. But didn't know what he had meant. ""Oh God help me"" I spoke. The thing stepped back slightly. My mind was racing now. Don't think that I have ever been as clear headed in my whole life as I was in these few moments, but I started saying the Hail mary. It wasn't working. The creature started towards me. Moving over leaves and fallen branches. Its image becoming clearer (I would describe it but I'll leave you with this instead, Remember your worst nightmare and multiply it by 50, that's what this thing was starting to look like) I was panicking now. Every part of me wanted to run away, but I was held fast.

Then I closed my eyes (I was actually waiting for the worst to happen) and said the Ár nAthair (are en-ah-her) the Our Father, in Irish. When I opened my eyes, everything had changed. I was, alone. The space in front of me empty. Nothing around me. I started to think I'd imagined it until I heard Go H-anamhaith ar fad! (Guh hawn a whah aer fawd) Well done. It was the old mans voice. I couldn't see him, but the warmth was there. I went home and slept well. I've never forgotten that experience the same way I've never forgotten any of them, but that's a nice one with some heritage. I'm happy to know my own language and I thank God every time I visit his home for my savior ghost.

The Dark Figure at my Window,"Texas, United States",Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: The Dark Figure at my Window

W hen I was a child (about 4 or 5 years old) I lived in very poor neighborhood in Texas. At that time we lived with our grandmother. The house was very old and made of adobe. Next to our house was a warehouse. My two older brothers and I shared some bunk beds. One of my older brothers slept on the top bunk and next to it was a window.

One night my brother awoke crying and screaming. He did not want to sleep on the top bunk. He was claiming that a monster was looking in the window. My mother had me sleep in that bed from then on.

One night I awoke to a dark figure wearing a fedora and a trench coat looking in the window. I could see the light from the warehouse next door right through this figure. I don't remember any eyes though. Sometimes I would wake up in middle of the night to see it pacing next to our house outside our window. I always thought it was a dream.

About twenty five years later my mother, brother and I were talking about that old house. I told my mother and brother about the ghost. I described the ghost to them and my mother had the look of fear on her face. My brother explained that he saw that same figure looking at him through that window and that is why he didn't want to sleep in that bed. My mother told us that she saw that figure in front of the house when she was walking home from work one night.

Big Black Man,Philippines,Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: Big Black Man

M y parents bought a house in Cavite. It has 4 bedrooms, 2 bathrooms (1 is located near the kitchen, 1 at the living room). It was my first week in that house and I enjoyed playing with my younger brother in my sister room. Her room is the biggest of all. It is located near the dining/kitchen.

One night, my Ate (eldest sister) told my mom if she could sleep with her because she feels sick. When my Kuya (eldest brother) heard about that, he asked us (my younger brother who is 6 y/o that time) if we want to sleep with him in my Ate's room. We will play video games. We were all excited that time. That night, we played until 9:30 p.m. At around 10 pm, my Kuya told us that we have to sleep already and we need to wake up early to attend a mass the next day.

At around midnight, I felt so cold, so I looked up for my blanket but I can't find it. I decided to turn on the light to see where it is but still I can't find it. When I looked up at the clock, it was already 1:45 a.m. I still feel so sleepy that's why I decided to sleep and share with my brother's blanket. When it's time for me to turn off the light, I saw a shadow passed in front of me. I thought it's just my imagination, but when I turned back to see who is it, I was so shocked on what I saw, it was a Big black man standing in front of me, around 6'5 tall, and few inches away from me. He was wearing all black things including a big black hat that looks like a cowboy's hat. I was so scared that time! I cried, and screamed and I jumped on the bed and waked up my Kuya. When my Kuya saw that man, he also screamed, louder than mine. We cover ourselves with his blanket and we pray while crying.

The next morning, we told our parents on what happened, at first, they didn't believe us, but when my Ate heard our stories, she also tell our parents that she also saw that man the night before we sleep in her room. She saw the man standing beside her bed.

After that, my parents decided to call a pastor to bless our house, and after the house blessing, the big black man didn't appear for 2 nights. We thought that he will not appear anymore, but were all wrong, it's just the beginning...

Through the Eyes of a Little Girl,Greece,Psychic / Medium,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Psychic / Medium :: Through the Eyes of a Little Girl

T his is not a story of ghosts. It is one that led me to believe in a world beyond the one we see. I don't know if I have any special powers - maybe we all do, provided that something triggers them, or maybe, it was the helping hand of another that ""touched"" me in the hour of need, and if that's the case,then, I'm forever grateful!

My memory begins the day I was accompanying mum to the doctors to take the results of her routine check-up. I was 7 years old and anxious to visit my dad at his work-place afterwards. Since he was the manager of one of the biggest hotels in the city of Rhodes I would rarely lay eyes on him during summer (not that I saw much of him in winter, either, but things weren't so bad then).

We reached the doctor's office and the moment his secretary saw us, she hurried to inform him. Upon entering his office, I felt, despite my young age, a bit uneasy and even more so, when the doctor spoke to my mum in a low voice, constantly looking at me. I do still recall him saying something about a ""shadow"" and then, in a very solemn tone, ""I will be sending your tests and these (the x-rays) to Athens (the capital of Greece) right away..."" He, then, proceeded to tell my mum that she would have to get on the first plane there.

I looked up to see her face. I might have been too young to understand exactly what was going on at that time but not stupid to sense something was terribly wrong! Besides, the look on my mum's face confirmed my fears.

She had always been my loving mother, the one that made everything bad go away - the one who loved me no matter what and, don't ask me why or how, I felt someone was going to take her away from me.

We were out on the street again heading for dad. This was a silent and heavy walk as mum held my hand tightly. She avoided eye contact with me but I constantly searched for her eyes only to see the tears rolling down her face.

""Of course. What more can I ask from life when your hand is in mine?""

""I'm going to go for a few days, me and daddy but we'll be back...""

""Soon, I promise..."" A brief pause then follows before she speaks again.

""Have I ever told you about a mother's love? It's the greatest, strongest and most everlasting love of all others! In fact, it's so strong that nothing can ever take it away. And even if, for some reason, a mother has to go away to another place where she cannot take her child with her, her love is still so strong that, even if she's up there with the stars, she can still see her child and protect it and speak to it and help it through difficult times...""

I couldn't understand why it might be my mother that has to go, leaving me alone. I was told that God, my God, was a kind and caring one who protected all of his creation. I knew he protected my mum when she was pregnant with me, when all others doubted she will come out of it alive. My God was the same God who saved both of us during labour and that was because my mum hadn't stopped praying to him. I was not meant to be born the doctors said but He let mum have me because she asked him.

I held her hand tighter now and tried to remain calm not wanting to make it harder on her. Yes, I was young but I could understand more than she thought and ever more than I was willing to reveal.

I remember mum into dad's office talking, guests coming and going, the soft music at the lobby, dad bending over the office desk and my mum taking his hand in hers. The world just kept going but for me that was the end of innocence and naivety.

Night came only to take my mum and dad to a place I couldn't be. I was left with grandma and grandpa. When everyone was asleep I ran to my parents' bedroom and reached out for an icon that hang over the head of their bed. Quietly, I ran back to bed and slipped under the cover, holding Madonna and her Infant close to my chest.

It was morning again and, despite grandma's persistence to get me out of bed, I remained there refusing to eat or speak. She finally gave up every effort and returned to her morning routine.

I distinctly remember myself being awake when, all of a sudden, the early morning sounds from the street blended with those of another louder one, and flashes of images of an unknown world let me into another reality-not my own.

I was walking between my parents but they were not holding my hands as always. I was literally running to keep up with them as we entered a big cold building with a tall ceiling and narrow corridors. We turn left and come to a stop outside the middle one of three doors in a row. Mum hesitates and then, refuses to enter. Instead, she sits on one of the chairs outside that door.

""You go in. He has already seen my tests by now. I can't do this"" I hear my mother saying and dad responding, ""Ok, I will go in first...""

I then lose sight of my mum as I follow my father into the office. An elderly man stands up to shake my dad's hand and before my dad says anything more than ""We have come from Rhodes..."" the man tells my father that he needs to say no more.

""My colleagues and I have reviewed your wife's test results and her x-rays and I'm here to say that there's absolutely nothing wrong with your wife. She's absolutely healthy so what you need to do is take her back to Rhodes and have a happy life...""

That is when every sound came to a halt and I found myself back in bed and to my Rhodian reality.

Grandma was once again over my bed looking rather worried now..."" Is everything alright? Let me check your temperature"" and at this, an overflow of words escaped from my mouth telling her the story.

She heard, silent and silent she remained as she caressed my head.

Later that day we heard the key turning on our front door and my parents happily entering the house. I jumped up from bed and ran to greet them followed by my grandparents.

""What are you doing back so soon? We thought you'd still be in Athens"" grandma said to hear that they had no further reason to stay away.

""... And as we entered this huge building, we turned to a corridor on the right where we came outside these doors. I told Michael I didn't want to go in...""

Years later and as soon as the ultra-sound was used by doctors we discovered that my mum's womb had a small lump on one side which was purely genetic. Probably that was what alarmed the first doctor who sent her off to Athens urgently.

Seeing What No One Else Admitted to Seeing,"New Jersey, United States",Psychic / Medium,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Psychic / Medium :: Seeing What No One Else Admitted to Seeing

W hile growing up we moved around a lot, mostly in New Jersey. During that time many things happened in my life that no one else in my family admitted to seeing or hearing. Like at night while in bed, I would wake up and notice that the curtains from the window were moving back toward the window. They had been off their rod again so to speak, but they always took the rod with them on their walks. As I watched they would move back and forth toward me and toward the window. It scared the crap out of me. In the same house I would hear the liquor bottles on the cabinet downstairs clink together when no one else heard them. They clinked all the time.

Later, we moved to Delaware - Harrington. In a house there, the game was on from day one. My sister and I saw the house for the first time when we unloaded boxes from the truck. Then our family left her and I there to unpack while they got another load. As soon as I walked into the house a voice not of this earth called my sister. She has an unusual name so it scared me that he knew it. She never heard it but I did. Once while sick with a migraine a wispy boy stood at the end of my bed as if checking on me. I was not afraid of him. Just startled by his appearance. These are just a few of my experiences. Maybe some day I will tell you about the porcelain clown doll that bites.

The Alpine,"Wisconsin, United States",Misc,"T his isn't a super scary story, just kind of unusual. About two years ago, when I was pregnant with my daughter, we decided to spend a weekend on the Wisconsin peninsula in Door County. As a child, my husband went to stay at a hotel called the Alpine right on the bay. When we got there I thought it looked like it could have been the motel from The Shining. We went in our room and it was really outdated, but in a charming kind of way.

The 13 inch tv even had a knob you had to turn without a remote - and NO CABLE! The first evening we were there, the false ceiling tiles started bouncing around. We joked that the place might be haunted, it sure looked like it should be! We explained it away to air pressure or vents. The next part though, I still can't explain. I've always been an early riser, so whenever I stay at hotels it's really hard because I'm up about 3 hours before the normal person on vacation. I was laying there at around 5:30 when I heard a door open. I looked up, though it sounded like it was outside of our room. In the round mirror of the waterfall dresser facing our bed, I could see a door open with a light on the other side of it. Well, the mirror is basically facing me, but above the bed a little bit. I looked above myself at the wall, and around the room for that matter, and there's obviously not a door or any light source that it could have originated from. The light in the doorway of the mirror opened and shut a couple of times and then after about 30 seconds it was gone. I could hear it opening and shutting, but like I said, it sounded like it was outside the room. It didn't scare me, I just thought it was really neat and couldn't explain it.

Unfinished Business,Philippines,Family / Friends Visits,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Family / Friends Visits :: Unfinished Business

H i guys! I've been reading this web site for weeks already and found it really interesting. I had always been curious about the paranormal, so I wanted to share some of my ghost stories as well.

One night, there were some men who were in the house repairing something in the backyard. One of the men decided to overtime and went home around 11pm. All of us were already asleep at that time. He suddenly heard someone, like calling his attention. ""Psssssssst"". He thought that someone was just mocking him. But as he tried to ignore the sound, it went louder and louder and it called him 3 times. He felt scared and decided to call it a night.

So as he got his bags and walked to the gate, he came across a lady. (A beautiful lady, he commented). He greeted the lady with a smile and a good evening. The lady smiled back and according to him, went straight to my room. He thought that it was just another family member who he hadn't met.

The next day, he was asking my grandmother who the lady was. He then saw a picture at the living room and told my grandmother that that was the lady he saw. As puzzled and as shocked as she was, my grandmother said that it was her daughter (my mother), and that she had passed away for 16 years now.

I was just wondering, why was there an apparition? Does she still have an unfinished business? That kept us thinking until now.

Something in my House,"Indiana, United States",Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: Something in my House

I live in Camby, Indiana, in one of the Heartland Crossing additions. I have been made aware just recently of another couple that is experiencing things in their home as well. I would really like to talk with you in detail and compare some things. My story starts from three years ago.

We move into our first home on May 8, 2004. The first night that my husband and I stayed home I experienced something that rocked my spirit, I was in the master bathroom taking a bath and my husband was showering in the other upstairs bathroom. As I was relaxing something felt very weird. When I opened my eyes there was a face in the mirror looking directly at me. I looked then closed my eyes not believing what I saw. I opened my eyes to see the face starring back at me. I sat up in the tub and prayed. I called out to my God for peace in my home. When I opened my eyes the face was gone.

Shortly thereafter my now three year old son started seeing a man named ""Mikey"". This was about the time that my grandmother moved in with us. He was afraid to go upstairs because ""Mikey"" would be mean to him. Nothing that I knew of had happened since ""Mikey"" came into the picture until my husband started talking. My husband told my on 11/22/07 that he has seen a dark figure in the doorway of the master bedroom one night as we were in the bed. He happened to turn over and look at the door and there it was. It had no feet but clearly a form. My husband said that he sat up and wiped his eyes and he said that when he opened his eyes to focus it was gone.

Then a week after he said that one night that I was working late he had dosed off but awakened to someone tapping him. He said he thought it was one of our boys so he just said come on man get in the bed. My husband said that it was about two minutes later when he felt this tapping again. This time he opened his eyes and noticed both of our boys were in the bed with him, so he turned over to see who was tapping him and there was no one there.

On December 28, 2007 my oldest son and myself were in my bed. I was asleep and he was watching NICK@NIGHT when I was awakened by my son screaming at the top of his lungs and trying to get underneath me. This alarmed me and I jumped up screaming what's wrong. He was shaking and crying saying I saw a man. I saw a man. I asked him what he looked like and my son said that he could only see his white hair and that his arms were open wide. (As to welcome a hug or something). I prayed out loud and held my son until he fell asleep.

I told my husband about this and once again he tells me of other things that happened on New Years Eve. Once again my husband and my three year old were in our bed. My husband dosed off and he was awakened by our son tapping him and pointing to the rocking chair in my room near the window. My son said ""Daddy who is that man?"" my husband says ""What Man?"" My son says ""That man right there, sitting right there..."" My husband said ""what is that man doing?"" My husband said that my son gestured that the man was smiling and shaking is head at him. My husband told me that he told my three year old not to pay attention to him and he will go away. On 1/5/08 around that time my Grandmother had mentioned to my husband that we need to get that evil spirit out of our house. She also said that she doesn't sleep very well.

As for myself I I am very sensitive to my surroundings. I feel things when they come around me and I feel things when they are watching me. I close my bathroom door every night before I go to sleep because I get a vibe that is disturbing when I don't. My bathroom and closet is always cold. I have experienced flashing lights at night that give off a green glow almost. I have heard as well as my husband and older son walking into the attic. At first we thought that the house was just settling and paid it no attention until we started moving our bed around to escape the noise and each time the noise would seem as though it is right above the new area we moved our bed.

Just recently on 1/22/08 I was sleeping on the couch and I had my head covered with the cover when I felt something tap me on the side. Immediately I got up and went to bed with my husband. Later that morning I wasn't quite asleep I was just waking up for work and heard a man's voice say ""Taushia"" I sat straight up and looked at my husband, he was still asleep as well as everyone else. Funny thing is our oldest (daughter) has never experienced anything or she has not spoken about it yet. I have asked for help with this matter and help is on the way.

Ouija Board in the Basement,"Michigan, United States",Ouija Board / Seances,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Ouija Board / Seances :: Ouija Board in the Basement

T his took place in the middle part of Michigan. The house was a large house with a Hugh basement. In the basement was three rooms, however one was made into two rooms. There were two windows in this basement none that could be open, just for light to be able to get through... Near the stairway was the room that was divided, half was the laundry room the other half was storage where glass beer bottles and soda bottles sat in cases to be used at a later date. Other things was in that room just storage area.

The room that Jill and I and the other girls went to was in the center of the basement no windows near us, just a big room that was used for exercise equipment. If we walked far enough into the large room we came to a smaller room where there was one window. The other window was in the laundry room.

I was babysitting for this young lady Jill she was around 10, I was nearly 18... Jill told me that her and her friends would go into the basement and play this really neat game with this board that was suppose to spell out the answer to questions. I asked her does it really work? She said if no one cheats it does. I said wow maybe I would like to play it sometime.

So she called up Carol asked her if she could spend the night and her mom could bring her over. Pretty soon here came Carol ready for the night. Now I am watching two girls about the same ages. So the three of us went into the basement with the ouija board. We sat down lit a candle and Jill told me to put my fingers only on the little piece that would spell words. Soon as I did that the candle went out and we could feel wind in there but, where it came from we didn't know.

We had to lite the candle about six times before it stayed lit.(should of known something wrong then but...) So we went and played the game. Well nothing happen but us telling each other we were cheating moving the piece around to spell out the answers. Finally I said you two can play not me and I went up the stairs. Soon they did too.

Several days went by I went back to babysit and we called Carol up and played the ouija board several more times till, we got into the discussion someone was cheating and gave up. The third time we thought it would be nice if Tammy came over, after all she just lost her baby brother from a car accident he was 3. She came over and we thought we ask the ouija board if her baby brother made it to the other side okay.(we should not of done that)

By the time we sat in a circle with the candle lit and Jill asked more friends over, there was about six of us then. The candle we could not keep lit. The wind we could feel in the room but didn't know where it came from. Then while my fingers are on that little piece we asked"" Is Tammies brother on the other side now?""

We heard something hitting the wall in the other dark room from us. It did that for several times. We should of been frighten then, but kids will be kids I guess. Tammy asked ""can you give me a sign my brother is on the other side?"" Again we heard noises from the other dark room and our candle went out making it totally black in the two rooms. I seen lights bouncing off the walls and no matter how much we tried to light the candle we couldn't. Something kept us from doing so.

Jill asked the board ""Who or what was making the lights bounce around the room?. Then we heard the glass bottles being slammed against the wall in the spare room behind us. That is when we got frighten. We could not see the stair way in the dark and were scared and more bottles being smashed up against the cement walls. But not in the storage room they are in the room we are in. Tammy said she could hear her brothers voice, I nor anyone else could hear it however.

Then I said ""something just flew past my face"" kind of felt like a spider web being dropped down on me or a net of some kind. I am fighting to try and get out of it seems to capture me into its grip. We can't see it's so dark. One of the gals screamed they got hit by the bottle, and we could hear it being smashed to the floor. We're all screaming now ""stop, stop this"". It kept going on, the lights bouncing around, the bottles being broken, sounds coming from the other dark room sounded like moaning to me. The girls are crying and screaming and I am with them there. We had to find the stairway in the dark and yet I didn't want to let the girls be away from me.

So we held hands and I told them DON'T LET GO OF ANYONE TILL WE FIND THE STAIRWAY. We finally found it by touching the walls around us. Odd however as being in the dark, scary basement of the house sometimes the walls felt like on fire other times just plain really cold like a freezer. We made it up the stairs okay and into the other part of the house far from the stairway that went down the stairs. Up stairs all seemed just fine. The lights were on, the music from the radio still on nothing out of place at all.

When we got up the stairs, Tammy had a cut on her arm I guess from flying glass from the bottles being broken. But Carol was the one that I couldn't believe. Her clothes were like shredded, it look like someone took scissors and just cut them up. Yet she said she didn't feel anything on her.

When Jill's mom came home she asked what happen we told her. She didn't believe us and was upset. She told us then we have to go down in the basement to clean the mess up. We told her we would but she was going too. We got down the stairs and there was broken bottles every where and some sticky stuff on the walls. Jill was the only one that nothing happen to, nor did she feel anything touch her. All she seen was the lights bouncing around the room.

I went to Jill's moms house a lot and when she ask me to go in the basement to get something I was scared but did as she asked, I always felt something was down there watching me. Then my friend told me for a long time she has felt that too, and usually don't do her laundry until someone is home and in the basement too. I often would stay the night at this house and I was to afraid to get up in the middle of the night to go to the bathroom, always felt that something was there watching me.

My friend moved from that home long ago and I wonder if anyone else who has ever lived there ever experience anything odd about it. But now that the ouija board was taken out and burnt by her mom, maybe what ever came out of it was burnt in hell. Anyone wanting to play with ouija boards all I can say is ""danger is just waiting to happen"".

We're Not Alone in this House,"Michigan, United States",Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: We're Not Alone in this House

I n 1991 my parents decided to move our family across the country to a small Northern Michigan town. My dad claims he found the perfect house for us to live in. It was an early 1900's Victorian home. The previous owners did a little remodeling to the home, an addition to the back of the house that held the new kitchen and the green house, a five stall garage was also added to the home.

With the U-haul and our station wagon packed, we headed from California to Michigan. The drive was long and being 7 years old with 3 other siblings in the car, we drove my mother crazy. We turned onto our road and noticed that all the houses seemed old. There were enormous Oak trees lining the road. Our house was the biggest one on the street, and looked the most haunted. The house was a pale yellow with white shutters. The house had a huge wraparound porch, bay windows, and it was huge. The price was steep, but it was the perfect size for our family of six.

My older brother bolted from the car first, running up the front steps, and yelling for someone to get the key to open the door. I grabbed the keys from my dad, and ran for the house. When the front door opened, we entered the foyer, which was a two story room that overlooked the massive wooden staircase leading up to the second floor. The four of us kids darted up the stairs to claim the best bedroom. After we chose our rooms, the moving crew started taking our things to our rooms. The first week, we unpacked our belongings. The house was starting to look more like ours with our furniture in it.

After everything was unpacked is when I started hearing noises. My parents passed them off as the old house settling. Our house in California was newer, so there weren't the usual old house noises. The third week there, I was woken up to a loud thud coming from the hallway outside of my bedroom. I got out of bed to see what it was, only to find nothing. I asked my brothers the next day if they had heard anything, the hadn't. The following night, I was awaken out of a dead sleep after my blankets were ripped from my bed. I yelled for my parents, who came rushing in, and passed it off as a bad dream. Again, my brother's (ages 5, 9, and 13) did not hear anything.

A month had passed without any unusual experiences. Then at breakfast, my 13 year old brother claims that he saw a woman wearing a red blazer and glasses was sitting in his room during the night. He flipped on the lamp, and she vanished. My parents told him to stop watching T.V. at night. A week later, I experienced the same thing, the same woman was sitting on the edge of my bed, humming a lullaby.

My parents did not believe any of this, and claimed that we were making things up because we missed our friends, and we wanted attention. My mother finally believed us when she walked out of the laundry room, and bumped into a man in the hallway. These things became normal for us through the next couple of years.

When I was 12, we had a birthday party for my brother. Their friends all refused to come over due to the haunted house. After I witnessed a man walk through a door, and things started to get out of hand, my mother wanted clues. My older brother who was now 18 and had moved out of the house to go to College, and his girlfriend came to visit over a break. His girlfriend went to use the bathroom, and when we heard a loud scream, we knew something had happened. She came out and said that someone had slapped her across the face, a woman in a red blazer, she didn't know who it was, but she was in the bathroom when she went in there.

After doing research, we found that the family who built the house had 4 boys. The parents and the children were in some sort of accident, and all 4 boys were killed. Later on, the father died in a tragic accident, and the mother, after losing everyone, took her own life.

We have come to believe that the reason why the woman is always in us kids' rooms, humming lullaby's or watching over us, is do to the fact that she is watching out for her ""boys...""

The ghosts in our home have come to be a part of us, they are normal, and knowing their names, anytime we see them, which is often, we call them by name. They never respond, and they never harm us. We do hold the best Halloween parties though!

Hay Barn Haunting,"Pennsylvania, United States",Family / Friends Visits,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Family / Friends Visits :: Hay Barn Haunting

I had ruled out the possibility of ghosts when I was younger but when I grew up and the same events have been happening for the past 8 years of my life I became a believer. I have started to realize the presence of ghosts, spirits, or some energy in my life. Some background information is needed to fully understand the haunting in my life.

I grew up in a small town in Pennsylvania close to Allentown. I lived in a normal size townhouse with my parents and two siblings and our pet dog Abby. My grandparents on my mom's side owned a farm about 15 minute away from our house and we would go there often to visit namie and pop-pop. The farm was a great place for me as a kid growing up I could go outside and find stuff to do all day when I had an imagination.

Many times over the summer we would spend the day out in the barns playing. There were three barns total on the farm. One was home to the 20 some pigs and 1000 + chickens, the other for equipment and the herd of cattle and three horses, and the last which was devoted to hay storage for all the animals. My cousins, siblings, and I spent time shelling cobs of corn for the chickens, hand feeding the cows hay off the barn floor, and giving oats and sugar cubes to the horses. After getting bored of feeding the animals we all would play in the hay barn jumping from the top of the stack into a soft pile of hay below. We also made hay forts or houses out of the hay bales. We would play house and such and the farm dog Holly would always be out there with us. Occasionally our pop-pop would come out and check up on us. We often times got yelled at for making the walls of our forts higher than our heads because he didn't want us getting hurt. He always had us in mind.

Then an unfortunate event happened when I was in the 4th grade. I got taken out of school to learn that my pop-pop had died in a barn fire. He was trying to save some possessions that were in the hay barn while it was burning and the trusses of the pole barn burnt through and collapsed on him not allowing him to escape. This was a huge turning point in my life because now there was a farm that had to be attended to and my grandfather who did it for a living was no longer around.

My dad stepped in and took care of the chores two hours before work every morning and two hours after work adding to his already labor intensive eight hour shift as a maintenance worker at a local area hospital. Slowly changes came about the farm. Taking care of 1000 + chickens and clean that many eggs a day was a huge commitment so they were the first thing to be sold. We kept about 50 chickens to sustain the family's need for eggs. The pigs were soon sold to market and some butchered for meat in the freezer. The horses and cows stayed because they are not as labor intensive. For two years every morning and night my dad feed the animals and took care of the operations of a working farm.

It was getting too hard not living on the farm in case of emergencies with the animals. Too many calls in the middle of the night where the cows got on to the road are not good. So the summer of 5th grade we packed up our town house and moved to the farm. My siblings and I entered a new school at the end of August and fit in well with the new environment. Now living on the farm everyone had chores greater than mowing the lawn and taking the garbage to the curb.

Every morning there were animals for each of us to feed before we went to school. Also in the winter months each of us had to bring in a load of wood for the furnace to heat the house. I started to become accustom to waking up at 5:30 to do chores before school. The farm life was getting to become natural to me.

Being the only boy in the family I had the job with all the heavy lifting which was transporting hay bales from the newly constructed hay barn to the cow barn where the horses also had their stalls. Every day I would load up a wagon with six bales and made four trips to feed all the steers, cows, and horses. Un-stacking hay bales was a chore done twice a day. I became proficient at climbing the stack and throwing bales off the top as not to create a deadly avalanche of 60 pound hay bales. Every time I was done throwing down hay I made sure it was safe to climb down to transport the bales and also that it would be safe the next morning to climb back up there. Several times I would notice that only one bale was out of place off the top of the pile. I thought nothing of it and picked it up and thought of it as one less I had to throw down.

One particular day I feed the animals early in the afternoon because I had an away sporting event in which I would not be home until late. As I opened up the doors to the barn I heard a muffled voice. I looked around and saw nothing. While I continued moving the hay I kept hearing the same sound. I still disregarded it and thought it was just in my head.

A couple weeks had gone by and I continued seeing misplaced bales but had not heard the strange noise. Then on a Friday I had the day off of school I fed the animals later in the morning. After opening the doors to the barn I heard the same noise that I did a couple weeks ago and I felt a strong energy. The hair on my arms and legs stood on end and I was freaked out but continued with my chores.

I had not had any encounters with this energy or whatever it was for the next several years. My chore was still feeding the cows and horses but now we had large round bales. They were easier to make over the summer time, easier to store, and easier to feed. So naturally we bought new equipment to handle these larger bales. Each round bale weighed about a half ton and would feed the herd for the day. So I only had to feed once a day now which was a great time saver not to mention I could use a tractor. Now with the large round bales I also noticed that some were being knocked off the top of the stack. This is very dangerous because 1,000 pounds is falling from about 15 feet. I never witnessed a bale being knocked over but even bales set upright on the ground would be knocked over the next day which was very suspicious. Considering that these bales are not movable by a person it would take a large group effort the put the bale on its side.

On a Saturday morning in mid September I went out to feed and got the same feeling I had several years ago and heard that same noise. This time I knew it was no joke. I turned off the tractor and ran inside for the camera. I took several pictures of the barn. I consistently came up with a bleached out spot in a shot on a digital camera. Once I didn't feel the presence of that energy I took several photos again and nothing was wrong with the photos. To this day I cannot explain what has happened but I think that it is the spirit or energy of my pop-pop, who died in the same place where the new hay barn was constructed.

I have attached two photos. One is normal and the other is a shot of the energy of my pop-pop. If anyone has had a similar experience please share it with me. I want to know if there is any way to rid his spirit or energy from the barn because it is potentially dangerous. Any comments or suggestions would be appreciated.

"A Forgotten Soul, and the Coshta Bower",Ireland,Psychic / Medium,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Psychic / Medium :: A Forgotten Soul, and the Coshta Bower

L et's not beat around the bush, some stories should not be told. In this case I'm not telling it, just simply writing it. I'm not saying that it's going to be scary or sinister. It won't change the mind of any skeptic, just solidify their ideas and dogmas. But ha, I'm not here to change anyone's mind. I don't care if it's believed or not. This is just one of the many things that happened to me. This story I'm about to write, is well, the focal point of all that happened. It is my burden, and I'm still waiting for it to finish. Or to put it another way, for the end to arrive. It will be exciting to see what happens after it. Enjoy, please.

1992. What a strange summer. I was just finished primary school, and heading for secondary school. I have by this time had two encounters with the supernatural, and I was very interested in learning as much as I could about ghosts. So I set up a club called ""the ghost club/Beastly remains"" its occupants of membership were myself and my best best friend Johnathon O' Reilly (who has sadly now passed away). This was to be his first encounter and my third. It is difficult to tell this story because an age of innocence for him and I was stolen after this. Too much happened for it not to have drastic effects.

This day, date forgotten, felt like it would never end. After breakfast John (i'm shortening his name for the rest of the story) and I went about our business of collecting clues to a case that we were working on. It had started with me a year previous, and if we had of had access to the net it surely would have been an open and closed case. But when is anything that easy.

I'm not going to tell that story. I'll save it for another time, maybe. So after going about collecting clues, we saw a crow with a cross attaching it to the ground. It was a very disturbing image. The crow was on its back, wings extended and a cross staked through the middle of its chest. It wasn't a clue to the case, we just found it on our travels. But it does need mentioning, because like I said, this day, was the focal point of my experiences, and THAT crow was an omen of some kind.

John and I had headed back to his house and out into the backyard where our clubhouse (his mother's shed) was located. We started putting together what we had collected but came up with no definitive answer. Fed up at this stage of always coming to a dead end, I threw our findings on the ground and pressed myself into an armchair which we had taken from a skip days earlier. Undefeated John sat next to me in his bean bag and suggested that we just head out for a walk, not to look for anything just, walk. It was after all a nice day. A little overcast, but the sun came out nonetheless.

John always wondered about the things that I saw. Was actually very jealous of my talent. He would always query about how they would look and sound. Did I believe in evil ghosts? He never understood why I thought that my two encounters already experienced were, evil spirits. I didn't have an answer for him. All I could ever tell him was, ""You know how there are good and bad people. Well why wouldn't there be good and bad ghosts?"" Then I felt it. Suffocated. Hot, in fact too hot. I started to choke on emptiness. I couldn't breathe. Then as quick as it had started, it stopped.

""You ok?"" John was standing beside me with a look of sheer fear on his face. Apparently I'd started shaking and screaming. I don't remember doing either. I took a look at my surroundings. See if there was anything out of the ordinary. I was standing in the middle of a small unused road, the factory of martin savage on my left, its fence bordering it, a 7 foot metal spiked guardian, and a disused cottage in front of me.

""Come on sit down"" John was at my side, concern still on his face. ""I'm ok"" I managed, yet my throat felt dry and scarred with heat.

""Lets take a look at that cottage over there, could be fun"" John didn't protest. Anything after my sudden attack was going to be a relief. We walked towards the cottage. It was like any other typical cottage, except its front door was bordered up and the windows on the front were stained and boarded up also.

""C'mon, there may be a way in over the other side"" I said. I went around the side of the house and found footing allowing me to climb the side wall, and use the factory fence as support on the way up. Once I got to the roof, John not far behind me, I slid down to the edge and peered over. There was a window slightly open just below me. Carefully, I let myself fall over the edge of the roof. I didn't want to fall into the nettles below or break anything. Once I was on the ground safely, I pushed the window open a bit more, just enough for John and I to enter through. Once inside the words vice versa came to mind. In the room we were currently in there was a ceiling and no floor, and the other room had no ceiling and a floor. By no floor I mean that we were walking along planks of wood on their edges, with one foot gaps between them and we had to be careful were we stepped. It wasn't the most exciting place to be. The other room only had a fireplace, the front door and a two windows. The one facing the factory was the only one letting light into the room. So we kicked about for a bit. I took my head into the fireplace and looked up the chimney. Surprise surprise it was dark and dirty.

""Hey Rob look at this!"" Coming out from the fireplace I walked over to where John was standing. There was a footprint, a small footprint. You could have counted the toes it was that clear, and blood. I looked at John in horror. He had blood on his hands

""Do you think someone was killed?"" I said. John only shook his head. ""It actually just appeared in front of me"" ""What?!"" Apparently John had been standing waiting for me to come out of the fireplace, when he saw the footprint appear beside him. The blood however was a different story. When he had entered, and I'd first gone to the fireplace, John investigated the room. He didn't find a lot except for blood dripping down from the top of the window beside the only door inside the cottage. He pressed his fingers into it, thinking that it could have been rust, but learning differently, and then the footprint appeared.

""Lift me up I want to see where the blood is coming from"" I put my back against the wall, joined my hands, and lifted John up so he could see up above the ceiling and into the attic. No sooner was he up, he was back down, jumped down from my hands in fact, and took off for the window. Not being a fool I followed example and ran for the front door. Knowing it would take John longer than I cared to wait to get out of the house. Through all the excitement I didn't hear the footsteps hobble across the opposite rooms' ceiling, but I did hear them fall to the floor we were currently occupying, and start to walk towards me. Without hesitation I kicked the bottom of the front door wide open and threw myself through, scraping my back along three nails, and then I saw it all.

The feeling from about 20 minutes before came back. But this time I could see it. I could see flames all around me, no where else. The room I was standing in was perfect. There were people in a panic around me. Then I heard myself screaming at them. Then it was over. The vision had stopped. It clarified what had happened earlier. The footsteps had also stopped coming towards me and I was back out on the unused road. In front of the house. I waited to see John come over the roof, but he didn't. I waited and waited. It felt like hours but in fact it was only seconds. Then I heard John. It was the most blood curdling scream I've ever heard. It chilled me right to the bone. Then after another minute or so John came over the roof and slid down to the road, falling with a horrible crunch.

I rushed over to him to see if he was ok. He was pale white. His eyes were unfocused, looking at me but through me. I picked him up and started to bring him home. Nothing was broken thankfully, he had a scrape or two but that's it. All he could say though, was, ""Grandpa, I need Grandpa"" I brought him to his Granddads' house, and knocked on the door.

When it was finally answered John had come round a bit, regained some of his colour. His Granddad asked what was wrong as soon as I had John sitting down. So I told him everything. He was sitting in a small kitchen chair when I finished telling him, and next he was raising his hands to hit John. I placed myself between him and my friend, and screamed at him for answers. Why was my mate all of a sudden mute? What had he seen? What what what? His Grandfather told me that about 65 to 70 years ago, he and his sister mother and father lived in that house. I was shocked. What had happened however was that his sister had just gotten a new dress and was dancing around the room admiring it. She was 16 and very beautiful he said. But the tail end of the dress went into the fire and she went up in flames really quickly. Needless to say she died, and that this is what I'd seen in my vision and what John had just seen. I'm thankful that I didn't see what he saw. We left his Granddads' house a few hours later. John had come back to reality and wouldn't speak of what he saw, all he said was ""Its not finished Rob""

We went back to the house, I know crazy right, and John said that I was to wait here. I was to wait in the middle of a pitch black road, while he went into the house. I protested. He just said ""wait here please"" So I waited.

Time went pass very slow. It was now nearing 11 o' clock at night and I was very hungry. Then somewhere off in the distance I could hear hoofbeats, and the sound of a carriage. I looked up and down that road and saw nothing except pitch black endings. Yet the noise got louder and closer. I closed my eyes, and started breathe deeply. I remembered the day and its events recalled them in my mind, and opened my eyes.

There in front of me were six black horses, a black carriage and a black rider. They stood out against the blackness around them. I could feel the breath of the horses and the gaze of the headless rider. I knew what it was at once, The Coshta bower, The death coach. My time was up. I cried. Then the words came out of the silence and formed in my head ""IN"" I started to step towards the coach when a girl slipped past me, and sat inside the coach. I was amazed. It wasn't for me. I was a witness. This doesn't happen. The Coshta bower appears only to those who its taking. I was on a different level of sight. I wouldn't have believed it if I hadn't seen it with my own two eyes. Then it was gone and in its place was John. He looked at me knowingly. ""Lets go"" he said. We went away from that house, not to return.

Later I asked John what he had seen. He didn't tell me about the girl, but the did say that I'm incredible. He had gone around the side of the house and felt sick. He vomited and then he came back towards were I was waiting and saw what he saw. He said he saw a bright white around me, and nothing else. He was unable to take his eyes off of me. I guess that was a good thing, because otherwise he would've seen deaths' servant.

After this day John and I saw each other less and less. We were in separate schools. But we talked until the day he died. Our bond unbroken, but a rift between us that we couldn't speak of.

I'm sure that the Coshta Bower will be back. This time for me. I believe that more than I believe in anything else. So I wait, and enjoy every day I live. As for the white light, that's my aura. I'm content (I've been told). The house is still there but there but it has no residents. I like to walk that path every now and then. It leads down to a nice old fashioned mill (my second encounter happened there) and an old train station. Sometimes I feel John walking beside as I travel down that unused but scenic road. He is the best of company.

Attacked by the Damned,Philippines,Psychic / Medium,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Psychic / Medium :: Attacked by the Damned

D ecember 31, 11:15pm... I was merely sitting in the living room alone; in front of me was a bottle of red wine sitting on the center table. I was entitled to that bottle as it was a present from my grandfather's brother. I sat on the sofa with exhaustion enveloping my conscience. I had finished doing everything for the New Year's festivities: I had set up the fireworks that my father told me to, I helped with the cooking and preparations, and I did the greeting of family relatives and friends to welcome them and so on.

By that time, the night sky was already covered with pre-occasioned fireworks. I felt something very strange in the area of the living room, although it was very faint for my exhaustion had moderately muted it and the outside noise was blocking its effect on me. I did not pay it any mind and decided to open the bottle; as I was reaching for it, a very strong shock in my head repulsed me to stop completely. My vision momentarily blurred but my head was still hurting. A sort of rampage has filled the living room with commotion: the sofa I was sitting on was shaking very hard, and the ceiling fan was as well being shaken by a force, the curtains were flying off even though the windows were closed, the lights flickering while my portrait and other hanged pictures on the wall are being flipped drastically.

I asked with some force left in me. Everything stopped moving, but now that I was electrocuted awake I felt the presence even more clearly than before I paid attention to it. I leaned my back against the sofa and thought that it had stopped completely. Before I knew it, I was being assaulted after the lights went out. I knew he was a man, but even in the pitch black darkness it was like he was a real person. I couldn't fight back and, no matter what, I couldn't scream for help since my father had trained not scream no matter what the pain is.

He was in between my thighs so I wasn't able to kick him anywhere. It wasn't a sexual assault. The fingers of his left hand dug into the right side of my torso, his nails stabbed me forcefully; the fingers of his right hand digging into my left thigh's skin scratching it and injuring my flesh. I felt it as an injury yet I couldn't see if it was really bleeding or not. My movements were limited as his left collarbone pinned my neck on the top side of the sofa's back rest. I couldn't breathe properly as his virile shoulders were very hard. I was losing the very last bit of my strength to stop him.

The applied pressure on his collarbone was weakening. He seemed to have leaned his face closer to mine.

His slightly grudging voice was digging into my ear as how it seemed unearthly.

""I have been damned from entering God's kingdom, let alone still using his name to protect me from evil spirits... I have been suffering all my life as you have been... Do not let this go to your heart forever and leave this anger and enter God's gates... I am certain you will be welcomed there as I can no longer be because of my sins...""

I have said this in my head for quite a number of times but I didn't expect it to be used for an evil spirit.

""Impossible..."" His grip tightened. ""How can you be damned from entering his kingdom?!""

Once his grip tightened, the air in my lungs skidding in my larynx making installments of moderately toned down moans and cries of pain.

""Please...stop...this... You have no reason... To be Sinning... I've been feeling pain for... 16 years... I...don't...want it... To be...17...""

He wasn't paying attention... I was as good as dead when my mother hadn't called me from the kitchen. He could have done a lot more damage at that position he was in. The lights went on and I saw the places where he scared me were really scrapped and bruised; I had to change clothes so that no one would notice it.

It continues for up until now and his visits are getting more painful and gruesome. Every time I was alone, he would do the same rampage but different forms of assaults in different positions.

Scratches and the Face in the Steaming Mirror,"Indiana, United States",Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: Scratches and the Face in the Steaming Mirror

O ne day I came home off the bus and went straight into the kitchen to have a snack. Walking out of the kitchen I felt the burning sensation on my back. I had my sister look at it and there were three little scratch marks on my back. There was no way that it could have been my bra because it makes an 'x' shape on my back and the scratches were in the corner of my back.

I got pictures of it on my sisters cell phone, but I don't know how to load them onto the computer. It hurt really badly, and I think the only reason it didn't break the skin was because I was wearing two shirts and one of them was a sweater.

Another time I had gone to the graveyard to visit my dad's parents. When we left I was being stupid and yelling, ""hey, follow me home, ghosts, follow me home!"" Apparently something did. That night I was going to take a shower, but I had to hurry because it was already about 12:30. I get the feeling that someone is watching me while I'm in the shower so I leave the curtain halfway open and peek out every couple of minutes.

A bit later I was peeking out of the shower curtain again because I heard a noise. On the mirror was a face print like someone had drawn a face on the fogged up mirror. It was angry looking and it wasn't there the first couple of times that I had peeked out of the shower. My family goes to bed at about 11:00 or so and unless they had moved faster than my head could shift, draw that face so perfectly, and closed the door without me catching them then It was probably something paranormal.

Our house is haunted anyway and If nothing followed me home then it had to have been something in my house. I will respond to comments or questions.

The Evil Ghost  from my Childhood,Jordan,Children Who See Spirits,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Children Who See Spirits :: The Evil Ghost  from my Childhood

G reetings to you all. Kids all over the world live their lives as kids, they play, they study, and they enjoy their time, but my childhood was what I call ""a disaster"".

Before I started going to school I was living in Jordan, a country close to Israel. Later on when I turned 5 years old my dad had to move to a part in Saudi Arabia for work, and we, as his family, my mom, me, and my little sister, had to move with him.

Moving to a new country, with new life styles, and being just completely different than people living there made it harder for me as a shy, scared, and a quite kid to even try make any friends, as I did not have any friends when I was in Jordan, but I was happy of having my grand-mother around who was a second mother to me.

It broke my heart to leave, and it made me worse than the way I was before moving. My mom looked at me as we entered the place where we are going to live and said ""it will all be ok, I'm right here with you, you can make friends I just believe in you"". At that time a weird feeling of fear captured my heart. The neighborhood had a huge fence all around it, it had huge old buildings, and every building included many hallways. In each hallway there were 10 wooden doors beside each other, every apartment did not include normal windows, they included little windows over each and every door, and this way you can not actually see people walking unless you open the front door. I can describe the whole building as a huge square with no way to breathe from unless you get a chair and stand on it to open the 2 small windows above the front door, which I could not do because I was only 5.

As I expected I did not make any friends, because I was different, since being a kid from another country, who speaks differently, and above all I'm not talkative. One day after few months, right after I started going to school, I came back home with the usual quite face and attitude, sat down on my bed and started doing my homework.

I was a kid who did not have many toys, because my dad had nothing to do with me, and always told me that buying anything is a waste of money, and for that reason I cherished every little thing I had. One thing I had was a piano shaped note book that my grand-mother bought me from jordan. After I finished my homework I took out the note book and started writing my diaries, and as I continued writing I started crying saying to myself ""no one loves you, no one wants to be your friend"".

As I said that I heard knocks coming from inside my closet, I looked at it in fear, then it actually stopped, I continued writing and the knocking happened again, but this time it was louder, which made me scream and run out. My mom searched everywhere in the closet telling me that there is nothing in there, but still I was terrified.

The next night, I was watching TV with my little sister who was still 2 years old, enjoying the cartoons, I suddenly heard my mom's voice calling me from the kitchen, as I went in there I did not find my mom, but I found a kid, it was a girl. She stared at me for so long, and I did not realize what she is, I smiled at her and said hi, hoping to have a friend once in my life, but she did not answer back, that is when my mom came to the kitchen from behind me and said ""here you are ! Did you eat your dinner?"". I turned at her with a smile and said "" mom I made a friend see? "" while pointing at the little girl, my mom looked there and smiled and told me ""where is your friend?"". I turned my head back and she was gone.

I did not get bothered by it because I did not know what is going on, so I went back to watch TV, and I sat down, suddenly I said ""ok"", got up, and pushed the TV off the counter and broke it. My mom came running and with shock asked me what happened, that's when I told her my friend told me to.

My mom felt bad for me, thinking that I created an imaginary friend to fulfill my loneliness, but it was more than that. The next day as I was sitting on my bed writing what I feel in my piano note book, something started writing back to me on it, and it said ""how are you?"". I smiled and said "" I'm ok "". My mom at that time passed by the room and heard that, still convinced that it is me playing with my imaginary friend. She wrote back to me "" I'm 16, what about you?"". I wrote to her ""I'm 7"", and that was the beginning of it all.

Later that day, when it turned around 8 p.m, I went to bed, my mom came to me and told me that she has to go to the grocery store with dad to buy groceries, and she will not be long, so she wants me to baby sit my little sister in case she wakes up. I nodded to her, and they sat down for a while waiting for us to sleep so they can go without scaring us, and indeed I slept.

I woke up after half an hour, with wide open eyes, completely terrified, and pointing at the wall in front of my bed, which I do not remember more about it. I got thirsty, got up, and went to the kitchen to get water after closing the door behind me to keep my little sister safe. My sister had frightening dolls, and they used to scare me too much, even until now I fear dolls, because I was forced to watch the movie ""chucky"" when I was 5 years old, with the next door kids tying me to a chair forcing me to watch it in a dark room, leaving me in there, which traumatized me for life. For this reason mom had to take all my sister's dolls and lock them in the storeroom, locking it every night in front of me.

I passed the door where the dolls all were, holding the cup, trying to run faster to get into my bed as soon as possible, and that's when I heard somebody knocking from inside the storeroom door. I started sweating from fear, my hands turned blue, and I could not swallow the water, but the knocks did not stop. A voice then talked to me and started calling my name in a tone as if we are playing hide and seek, she was talking from behind that door, it was the 16 year old girl, who I thought was my friend.

I started screaming, ran to the phone and called mom's friend who was a next door neighbour, she answered the phone and I could not speak, she kept saying hello until I started screaming "" HELP ME ! I WILL DIE ! PLEASE HELP ME!"". She started telling me to calm down, asking me where my mom is and what is happening, and that is when I hung up, almost had a heart attack as I heard somebody breaking plates in the kitchen. I ran to the front door not able to feel my legs from fear I tried to open it but it was locked. Shaking and out of breath, I heard the neighbour trying to open the door from the other side telling me to try with her while she was hearing me cry and scream with noises around me, and suddenly I heard the storeroom door opening, that is when I passed out from fear next to the door.

I am 22 years old now, and back to jordan since I was 12, I do know that she is still around, because I feel her, dream about her, and hear her humming most of the time, but why is she still stuck to me? And what did I do wrong? Was I an easy target since I was with no friends? Am I still an easy target? I wonder why she still wants to hurt me...

Mixed Feelings about an Apparition,United Kingdom,Family / Friends Visits,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Family / Friends Visits :: Mixed Feelings about an Apparition

I wanted to see my grandmother, who died in 2006, third of jan to be exact, it was quite early (well for me), at about ten thirty to eleven at night, I was just laying on my bed facing the T.V. My mum had just emptied her wardrobe, all her clothes were hanging on my wardrobe.

Here's a quick bit of background, on christmas day we went to see my nan in hospital, where my younger brother (we will call Dave), gave my nan a red west ham united teddy, this he in fact forgot, and he got it back after she died. A few weeks later, my mum heard my brother going downstairs, and she followed him, where he got a glass of water, she asked him what it was for and he said my nan, he said she had a nasty cough, so upstairs they both went where my mum found loads of tissues surrounding this teddy, quite freaky I thought, but a couple of months ago my brother lost this teddy.

So back to the story, I'm laying there watching T.V when this missing teddy appears, right on top of the T.V, now I'm freaked and Dave looked over at me, then we both stared back at the teddy, and it vanished, right there, then the dressing gown, on my wardrobe, started to move, like wind blowing it, and of course it was in front of the window, so I closed the window, (the window has one opening on the top), I went back to bed, but the dressing gown is still moving. I check the window closed, I check the door, closed, and just as I climb back into bed the dressing gown flew to the flow, and it rose, like someone crawling from the floor, and there stood, a very tall woman, with grey short but curly hair, very broad shoulders. I realized it was my nan, she smiled at me and disappeared, now, although it sounds nice, but the feeling I got before she appeared, was of an evil one, I was very frightened, but when she appeared everything went warm.

Is this is a sign she is protecting me from something in my room, or is she the evil thing, can you please help me. Thank You

Big Mama Pays a Visit,"Rhode Island, United States",Pets / Animals,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Pets / Animals :: Big Mama Pays a Visit

A bout 2 years ago, a beloved cat named Big Mama passed away. She belonged to my aunt and 2 cousins, but was loved by the whole family. She was the sweetest cat I've ever encountered. Before I tell the supernatural part of this story, I feel I have to tell you how amazing Mama was.

Originally, when I was about 7, my aunt's brother had to get rid of her because he couldn't take care of her in his new home he was moving to. So she took her, changed her name from Chewy (short for Chewbaca, or however you spell that Star Wars character) to Big Mama, and brought home the most beautiful cat in the world.

She was a calico cat, colored orange, brown, white and black, and she was really fluffy. She would do all sorts of tricks to make us laugh and loved to cuddle and be petted.

A few years after, my cousin wanted another cat, which she brought home. Her name was Tweety. She was black, slinky, and had an attitude problem. She was always hissing and clawing at everyone. Big Mama was scared of her, and I don't blame her; she scared me, too!

Eventually the two got used to each other and a couple times we'd catch them cuddling together. Years later when Tweety would give birth to her first litter of kittens, Big Mama would watch the birth and then come meowing to my aunt to alert her: the kittens were here! As the kittens got older, Big Mama ""assisted"" Tweety in mothering. She'd play with the kittens and not make a peep when they would crawl all over her.

Big Mama started to get sick, and it turned out to be a kidney stone. She had trouble going to the bathroom and when she did she would bleed. The doctors fixed her up and slowly she began to heal. She started to gain weight after that, and we always joked how her name fit her perfectly because she was ""fat kitty..."" She loved to roll on her back and have her tummy rubbed, making her look like a round furball. It was so cute, she was so cute.

About two years after her surgery Big Mama started losing all her weight and wouldn't eat too much. She didn't even play anymore, she would just lounge around the house. Then one day she was gone. I remember it was in the summer, in August. My aunt found her behind the tv, or under the bed; I forget which.

Two days after her death, still not believing she was gone. I decided to pay my cousin a visit after giving her some space to grieve. We were sitting in her sister's room reminiscing about Big Mama and how much we already missed her.

My cousin told me later that night on the day she died, she was laying in bed not able to sleep, still sad over Big Mama's death. All of a sudden she felt her walking on her bed and on her legs, just like she used to do when she was alive and wanted to cuddle next to you to sleep. My cousin said she was freaked out to see the blankets move and feel her paws but it was comforting.

I was thinking about this, when all of a sudden I heard Big Mama jump off the kitchen table like she used to all the time. My heart beat a million miles an hour and I looked at my cousin who grinned at me. ""See? She came to visit,"" she said. I was amazed, and comforted because it was a bittersweet day. I had just found out my dad had cancer and it was raining that day but the sun was also shining. It was a beautiful sight, and it was almost as if Big Mama came to say she was okay and that everything would be alright.

That night I cried, and realized she was in Heaven where she belonged. We haven't gotten anymore visits from her since that day, but I know she's here still playing and sleeping and waiting to have her tummy rubbed.

Tales From The Homeplace,"Tennessee, United States",Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: Tales From The Homeplace

T he old homeplace started out as a simple four room farmhouse with an attic type upstairs. It had porches in both front and back, with part of the back porch having been turned into a ""smokehouse"". The floor plan was simple, coming in through the front door was the living room, to your right was the master bedroom. The attic sat on top of these two rooms, with the L-shaped staircase coming out into the living room. The kitchen and dining room abutted these two rooms, with a door from the living room leading to the kitchen. As you entered the kitchen, to your left was the dining room door and in the far end of the kitchen was a door going to the back porch.

I started living here when I was six following my real parents' divorce, so the year would be 1961. All the kids slept upstairs, except the oldest which slept in a makeshift bedroom in the dining room. The dining room was probably the most haunted room in the house. First I will tell you what I can attest to.

The room had an eeriness about it that would strike terror in us kids. It was like there was something in there that absolutely hated you. Although nothing ever bothered us, we would run past the doorway. This could have all been in our heads but the coldness of the room wasn't. We actually used the room for a refrigator. We had a milk cow, so we had plenty of milk and butter and we kept it in this room to keep from spoiling, even in the hottest part of summer. You could hear crashing noises coming from the room and when you checked nothing would be out of place.

At other times you could hear crashes and when you checked the honey cans would be scattered all over the floor. The door had a habit of locking from the inside. The ""lock"" we had was an old fashioned turn latch, like you found on outhouse doors. You could wait awhile and go back, the door would be unlocked. These I witnessed with my own eyes.

The following events I can't attest to, I wasn't there but I can attest to the honesty of the ones that were. I believe it to be true. This incident happened in the mid to late fifties. It was Christmas Eve and the family had all gathered in to spend the holidays together. They were all in the kitchen laughing and talking when one of them went to get something from the dining room and the door was locked. Everyone was accounted for, so Pete, one of the son-in-laws, put his shoulder to the door and forced it open, knocking the latch off in the floor. They got what they wanted and Pete nailed the latch back in place so tight that he couldn't turn it. He laughed and said something to the effect that he would like to see it (he called it a name) lock it now.

No sooner than he pulled the door to, it latched again. He forced it open again and this time he nailed the latch with two 16 penny nails, side by side-making it impossible for the latch to turn. When he closed the door - it latched. Just when he was about to force the door for the third time, it sounded like all hell broke loose in the dining room. It sounded like something was tearing the room apart. Pete started to go in the room but Mom and Dad stopped him, telling him to wait until ""it"" settled down.

When things got quite about ten minutes later, he started to force the door open but decided to check it first. He pushed on the door and it opened as easy as pie. He walked in and nothing was out of place except the latch to the door was laying clear across the room. The two nails that held it in place was twisted together like you would twist electrical wiring. Nothing else happened that night and the room was quite for a long time thereafter.

The Snore,Philippines,Misc,"T his story happened last December 14, 07. Both of my parents were in the province to visit my grandmother who is very ill that time. (She died last Dec. 24). I came home at 7 pm from school. My sister wasn't there yet because she was still in the office, and my brother was with her girlfriend.

I was so tired, hungry, and had a very bad headache. Migraine. Every time I had it, I don't want to hear any noise, or light because it will trigger the pain. I took my dinner and my medicine before I went to sleep. I called my brother on the phone to ask if we can switch room just for the night, because his room is darker than mine. I am afraid of the dark since I was a child, but when I have migraine, dark place is my sanctuary.

That night when I was sleeping, I felt someone lying beside me. I can hear someone snoring behind my ears. I thought it was my brother so I didn't mind it. After a few minutes, I can still hear him snoring. This time it's getting louder and louder. It gets me irritated, so I woke up, turned on my left side, and tap my brother on his shoulder. I said ""hey, will you stop snoring, I can't sleep well"", he answered me with a ""hmmm sound"", (like someone who is tired and still sleepy).

After that, I thought he will stop already but still, he kept on snoring. I asked him again to stop snoring (while tapping his shoulder) or better not to sleep beside me and use my room instead because I'm not feeling well. He answered me again with a ""hmmm sound"" and then continue to snore. What I did is just cover my face with my pillow and continue to sleep. Maybe my brother is also tired.

The next day when I woke up, my sister, brother, and his girlfriend are having their breakfast already. They ask me to join them. My sister asked me if I'm already okay, and if I sleep well last night. I said ""No! Because this brother of ours snores a lot! After I said that, the three of them looked at me with a big question on their face. I asked them ""why are you guys looking at me like that?"", and then my brother said to me, ""I didn't sleep here last night. I'm with Jhelai (his girlfriend) and my other classmates at Luigi's place doing our thesis... I was so shocked after he told me that. I'm pretty sure it's him. I heard him answered me with ""hmmm sound"", and I'm very sure that it's not my sister either.

And I'm absolutely sure that I'm not just dreaming that time...

My First Ghost Hunt Made Me Sick,Australia,Ghost Hunting,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Ghost Hunting :: My First Ghost Hunt Made Me Sick

S ince my last story I have started ghost hunting in australia to better understand the paranormal. There are only two of us but we are looking for others to join. This story is about my first ghost hunt which did not go as well as planned. I have only ever told this account to one person and there help and guidance for future hunts has been extraordinary in keeping my partner and I safe.

Some of you may recall my first story Unwanted Party Guest which involved a cottage with a very troubled and violent history behind it. This was the scene of our first ghost hunt. My partner is very religious whereas I am a little skeptical of religion. We arrive at this cottage and start taking some pictures of the surrounding area. Not much came up on these except for an orb or two every know and then.

We then make our way up to the house. My partner crosses her self and says a short prayer before entering. I do absolutely nothing and just walk on in. We walk around the house from room to room taking photos and just keeping an eye out for anything unusual. After taking photos my partner starts asking questions out loud such as ""if there are any spirits here please show us a sign"". Nothing happens in the living room.

We head for the bedroom where the murders took place and my partner once again asks questions ""if there are any spirits here please show yourself"". As soon as she finishes talking, I feel a sudden drop in temperature, and it was summer at the time. I ask my partner if she felt it and she said no. I suddenly start to feel nausea and dizzy. My partner notices this and starts to worry. The next thing I know, I'm outside flat on my back looking up at my partners worried face. She told me that I blacked out and she dragged me outside.

For the next week after that I had to miss work because I was always cold and sick. I would wake up from a very strange nightmare and would recall smelling a foul smell just before I wake up and when I wake up I would be sick.

I am now well and have returned to work and have started to be more religious. My partner and I have been on more hunts since which have turned up some great evidence.

Sloss Furnaces,"Alabama, United States",Ghost Hunting,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Ghost Hunting :: Sloss Furnaces

N estled deep in a city full of new businesses and fancy car dealerships lies a piece of history with a haunting background. Sloss furnaces was operated as a pig iron-producing blast furnace from 1882 to 1971. Over the course of its actual industrial existence, there were many tragic deaths that occurred there. Whether it be someone crushed in a grinder, or melted in a furnace, Sloss had it all. This was back when laborers would work in the harshest conditions, especially those who worked near the furnaces in the dead of winter. Many explained it as being burned on one side of their bodies, and frozen on the other side.

Well, nowadays, its still used as an iron mill, but the main buildings of the place aren't used, these are also the same buildings which are said to be the most haunted, which me and my friends quickly found out for ourselves... We first traveled to Sloss Furnaces in late May, 2006. We had never been to this place before, nor did we know if we were allowed there. We walked on inside and found some workers working on the other side of the property and asked them if we could hold an investigation.

The boss there told us yes, as well as explained some of the history of the place. He also shared some of his own personal sightings in the place. So, he let us go on out there and investigate the place, we heard many sounds and saw many things while we were there. Including, a pipe swinging on its own free will, the sounds of footsteps on the catwalk, when no one was there, as well as a full body apparition step back into the shadows. I could explain some of the more serious stuff that we've seen there, but it would be better if you saw it for yourself.

So, check out the hauntings and let me know what you think, thanks for reading. Be safe, and happy hauntings.

The Entity that Wouldn't Leave,Puerto Rico,Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: The Entity that Wouldn't Leave

T here are four of us, siblings, in the family. I'm the oldest and there are three of us, girls, and the youngest is a boy. My brother is about seven years younger than I. At the time of the event that I'm about to relate, I was 16 and he was 9. He had his own bedroom, my two younger sisters were in one bedroom and I had my own, which connected to the my sisters' room.

After the incident with the Ouija Board , my brother and I saw weird shadows several times and we both suffered from very bad nightmares. It used to be very bad with him.

This one night, we were awakened by my brother screaming. This happened often enough and my mom would go in and console him until he fell asleep again. This time, the door to his bedroom wouldn't open. My dad thought that my brother had unknowingly locked the door from inside before he went to bed, so he went to fetch a screwdriver.

In the meantime, my brother is screaming in the bedroom. I turned the knob and it opened and I went in the room. My mother was right behind me, but the door slammed in her face. To this day, she still thinks that I did it, but I didn't. I went to my brother and he kept pointing towards a corner of the room, crying. When I looked, there it was... A shadow in the shape of a man. I couldn't distinguish facial features, except for maybe the eyes, although I couldn't explain to you what they really looked like. I could feel a lot of anger in the room and it was sort of contagious as I also felt getting angrier, instead of afraid after the initial shock of seeing this thing. The bedroom wasn't completely dark as my brother couldn't go to sleep without a night light, yet there it was, this thing standing in the corner.

I could hear my dad trying to get the door open and I grabbed my brother and walked towards the door, not turning my back to the shadow. We heard a sound that was between a laughter and a growl, very weird. At that point, I turned the door knob and was able to get the door open. My dad was standing there with the screwdriver. My mom took my brother to their bedroom and I told her that I was certain that there was something in the house.

The next day, I talked to my grandma, who was more open about these things since she had many experiences of her own. She talked to my mom about it, and my mom talked to a friend in her church. The house was blessed and things quieted down for a few days.

However, they started again and much worse. My brother and I saw the shadow several times after that. Our nightmares got worse. My dog, a miniature poodle named Blackie, would bark at the air and follow something around the house, barking. Things would move on their own.

To this day, my parents still live in that house. They have no experiences, unless they just don't want to tell. I live in the States now and every time that I go back to visit, my nights are sleepless. I don't know if it is my imagination, but it almost feels as if whatever it is, waits for me to be there to manifest itself. Maybe it has a bone to pick with me, so to speak... I don't know.

Three Little Girls,"Indiana, United States",Apparitions / Voices / Touches,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Apparitions / Voices / Touches :: Three Little Girls

M y dad had came home from work early one day to get some sleep before going back in at 5:00. He was getting ready to lay down when he heard music. Not just any music, but female voices singing. He went into the living room and found that the noise was coming from downstairs. He assumed we were home early from whatever reason he didn't know.

So he was going downstairs to check on us, but when he got to the entryway and was about to proceed down the stairs the singing was now heard from the upstairs. He kept going back and forth trying to find out if it was upstairs or downstairs, but by now he heard it from every direction. He decided to just head downstairs to see if we were there and when he got to my bedroom door and pushed it open there were three little girls on my bed, sitting in a circle, singing together. My dad told me that they were speaking in another language because he could hear their voices loud and clear and couldn't make out one word.

When the girls finally noticed him they made a scared face and disappeared into thin air like when you turn the channel on your TV. This whole event only went on for at least 5min. Or so including when he was trying to find out where the voices were coming from. He said the song seemed kind of fancy for today and that they were all wearing old fashioned dresses. One girl had her hair in two pig tails. Which reminds me that I've actually experienced my hair being braided in rolls while I was sleeping and me nor my sister know how to do that. We now hear voices, but have never seen the girls again.

Orbs at the Gu Yi Ju Ancient caves,China,Photographs / Videos / EVP,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Photographs / Videos / EVP :: Orbs at the Gu Yi Ju Ancient caves

I am Australian, but I live in china. I go to school here. I have recently taken a trip to the Gu Yi Ju Ancient caves. These caves were the home for the banished emperor and his followers over 600 years ago. The government soon found out the hiding place and sent the royal guard to capture the emperor.

The soldiers finally caught up with them and massacred all of the emperors followers and soldiers, set fire to the camp and took the emperor back to Beijing.

We went to the village which is built into the mountain, only a few of these are open. I took about 40 pictures and 15 contained orbs. Most were following my Aunt, who was visiting. They seemed to be drawn to her. One was in the corner on the floor, like a baby would be. Another 3 were over a sacrificial table (for reasons not need explanation) and a very large one in the emperors house. Maybe a royal guard or the Mayor of the village.

These photos have been submitted to many web sites and most people believe that these picture are the real deal. I was freaked when I saw these pictures, because I was actually in the presence of a 600 year old person/spirit.

This is just an experience that I wanted to share to find out what others think.

Scared of Clowns,"California, United States",Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: Scared of Clowns

H ave you ever had an experience that was so unexplainable, that even after twenty years, you still pull that memory out and examine it, searching for answers? That is what happened to me, and I am still grappling with this experience. It all started when I was ten years old, in the summer of 1982.

My family had flown from Pennsylvania to California to visit my Aunt and cousins. I have never had any type of paranormal experiences aside from those in this house, which I am about to relate. So I had no bad vibes or hesitation about staying at this house, the thought of anything paranormal never crossed my mind. A little background on the room I was staying in, it belonged to my cousin and had a very large clown painted on the wall. At this point I was not scared of clowns, not amused either, just indifferent. The lights in the room were controlled by a dimmer switch, you would push the switch in to turn it on and then turn it to adjust the brightness of the light. For some unexplained reason, my cousin, brother and I spent the night sleeping on the floor, no one was in the bed, must have been a kid thing. I awoke in the middle of the night and noticed that the light was getting brighter and brighter. As I lay on the floor trying to figure out what was going on, the lights started to get dimmer and dimmer. The change was not super fast, but definitely fast enough to be noticeable. The dimmer switch was located next to the door, and I expected to see my folks or aunt standing there, checking up on the kids, but the door was firmly shut.

I have never been so scared in my life, too scared to even wake the others up, I just laid there watching the lights get brighter then dimmer to the point it was almost total darkness. The scariest part was that I knew that clown was on the wall a few feet away from the dimmer switch, I could not bring myself to glance away from that switch, certain that the clown would be looking at me. It seemed like the lights were changing for hours, but that was probably the fear that made it seem so long. I do not think I ever went back to sleep that night, just stayed there, too scared to move!

In thinking back on this over the years I have never come up with a logical explanation for what I was, it seems that a malfunctioning light might have gone on and off, but not brighter to dimmer. I also questioned whether I truly ""woke-up"", but the experience is so clear, the feelings and the fear, after twenty five years, that it seems unlikely. Ever since that night, I have been scared to death of clowns.

Fast forward to twenty plus years, I was taking a business trip out to California and was planning on staying at my Aunt's home for a few days before I started my work. I was exhausted the night I arrived and went to bed early. Honestly, the entire light episode was so far from my mind, that I fell asleep instantly. I awoke at 4:30 in the morning, wide awake. This always happens when I fly from the east coast to the west, and have found the best way to deal with it is to just get up, knowing I would not be able to fall back to sleep. I decided to go into the family room and watch TV, since that room was far removed from the bedrooms, no one would be disturbed at that early hour. In order to get to the family room I had to walk down the hallway the bedrooms were located in through the den. As soon as I entered the den, I froze. There is no other way to describe it; I just did not want to take a step into that room. To the right side of the den is a couch, without looking at the couch, it was as if I sensed that there was something there, that did not want me in that room. I admit it I ran through that room into the living room, never glancing at the couch. When I got to the living room, everything felt normal, but I still turned on every light and the TV! As I sat there, I thought back to that first experience and the one that just occurred. I could not explain that overwhelming fear I felt. I had never felt anything like that in my life, I thought maybe subconsciously I was thinking about that earlier experience and it was affecting me still.

After a few hours, my aunt joined me in the living room. We had never spoken of the paranormal, and I was not sure what her views are on it, so I was not sure if I should mention it to her or not. Well, I ended up telling her everything, both the experience twenty some years ago (which I had never mentioned to anyone but my brother) and that mornings adventure. It was then she told me that when they had first moved into their home, she had a very vivid dream that there were two people sitting on the couch in the den, she said you could not make out features, they were more black shapes, but it appeared that both ""shapes"" were holding cigarettes. In her dream she said you could see the red tip of the cigarettes glowing.

I still can not decide if the experiences I had at that house were a combination of my imagination and electrical problems, or if something is truly in that home. The second experience I tend to doubt more easily since it relied on feelings. I almost wish I had looked at the couch to see if something was there. But I know if I had it to do over again, I would still run. I should note that I have lived in various places, some of which have been over a hundred years old and never had any other experiences at all.

Any thoughts, ideas or explanations would be appreciated. And yes, I still hate clowns.

Scary Image on TV During Commercial Break,Canada,Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: Scary Image on TV During Commercial Break

T his story takes place at a friend's house when I was in the 10th grade. Now there are a lot of places in this town that people claim to be haunted but my friend house really had something about it. Whatever was in his house really seemed to dislike his cat Willie. Poor Willie was always on edge because whatever was in this house liked to hurt him. On more than one occasion I saw Willie walking and then some invisible force would kick him so hard he would get lifted off the ground. Other times he would be coming towards me and he would get pulled backwards across the room by his tail. I hated seeing it because the poor cat would just cry and cry.

One night in particular Willie was acting very skiddish. My friend, his girlfriend and I were sitting on his couch watching one of those eating contests on TV... Willie was running and hiding from something none of us could see. The show we had on cut to a commercial for some sort of shampoo and we were all just sitting there not really paying attention to anything but the television.

The TV started cutting out slightly and then the commercial ended and the screen went totally black. All of a sudden for literally like 2 seconds a picture flashed on the screen. I will never ever forget for the rest of my life.

This picture was almost like a family portrait of a young blonde mother holding a baby, with a little girl standing to her right, they were all in white dresses. The mother and baby were sitting on a garden swing surrounded by flowers and the little girl had a bouquet. The thing wrong with the picture was that the mother and the baby had no eyes, just bloody gaping holes where eyes should be, and the little girl basically looked like she had gotten her head blown clean off. Their dresses were covered in blood and yet the mother was still smiling.

Right after the picture Willie came running out from under the table only to get a swift kick across the room from whatever it was we couldn't see. We all just sat there stunned at what we just saw.

No one said anything for a good 20 minutes when finally my friend asked, ""Did you see that?"" and his girlfriend said ""What the dead family on the TV? Yeah I saw it"". They looked at me and I nodded, ""Yeah I saw it too...""

My friend called a friend of his who he knew was watching the same tv program and asked if he saw anything. Him and the people he was with said they saw nothing.

I still don't know if it was just some signal getting crossed to the TV or if it was something paranormal. Any comments would help though.

Crazy Visions on an Old Mirror,Canada,Apparitions / Voices / Touches,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Apparitions / Voices / Touches :: Crazy Visions on an Old Mirror

I just got a mirror in my room that has been in my family for as long as I can remember. Explains a lot. I do not know exactly how long but I know my mom used it a lot because she used to be a hairstylist (free haircut). But now I am noticing some weird things about it.

Usually about ten to 20 minutes before bedtime I am listening to music while playing my guitar or playing air guitar. My guitar is an Electric but out of tune and a bit wrecked so I rarely play it. I am seeing things like People, Animals, and Shadowy figures. Now since most of you have read my stories you will know I have SOME experience with paranormal, not a lot.

One time I just woke up and looked into the mirror wondering if my hair is too messy or not messy enough (weird from a dude but I always have to look messy). And as I was messificationing my hair I noticed a shadow person thing fly by in the mirror. I quickly looked around my room and nothing felt out of place except my closet. Now my closet is packed with boxes because we never got around to emptying it (not that I want it emptied). As I looked around I saw a shadowy ball thing like a person in the fetal position. And it then disappeared and two boxes started to fall. I have good reflexes when I need it so I got them before they fell.

This other time I was playing my guitar (cannot remember which song I was playing). And I saw a Bird in the mirror fly across the room. We do not have birds anymore and it did not look like any of the 2 we had. The last thing I remember is I was putting my clothes away and I noticed there was a man standing at my door. My door was closed and in my house you can't go into someone's room without anyone in there noticing. It didn't even look like anyone I know or knew so I kind of got creeped out. So when I go to sleep I make sure I do not face the mirror because some lights can shine through if there is enough light outside my room.

I can also see a Lady in there probably about mid 30s I don't know can't remember what they looked like. Maybe they will show up again and I can tell you all.

Things Are Moving on their Own,"Washington, United States",Poltergeists / Physical Manifestations,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Poltergeists / Physical Manifestations :: Things Are Moving on their Own

I have no idea why these things happened! I didn't think I did anything for these things to happen. They didn't scare me as much as I thought something like that would. One day I was just getting out of the shower and in front of the mirror brushing my teeth. There are these razors attached to the wall opposite of the showerhead in the shower.

All of a sudden I see in the mirror one of them gets ripped off and hits the other wall really hard! It was as clear as day and it was very loud. My grandma came running and thought something happened to me but I told her what had happened. She didn't really believe me until we looked in the shower and there was the razor just sitting on the ledge the hole thing (the little carrier too) was just sitting there on the opposite end where it use to be. It just flew across like something threw it. That's just one thing that happened though.

Once I was downstairs going to my room and right before I walked through my door I heard this weird smacking, wet, noise. It was a mouth noise like chewing food with your mouth open really loudly. I started to follow it assuming there was something over there making the noise but nothing was there! I followed it and it kept moving around the room. I just kept following it around and around! It was like running away from me but I kept following it.

After that I got kind of scared and ran upstairs and told my little sis (she's only six though) just so I didn't feel all alone.

Another experience was when I was in my room feeding my turtles when all of sudden the beads over my door (the beads that hang down, and you walk through) start spinning like really slowly. Not like wind blowing them but like spiraling, like rotating it was weird. I got really scared and backed up on my bed and started humming. Humming just made me feel less alone or not just so silent, it makes it less scary. Then they all stopped except one and it started going a little faster then just stopped. I sat there for like 10 more minutes and then finally worked up enough courage to walk through them to upstairs. I didn't bother to tell anyone because I knew no one would believe me.

The last thing is one time I was downstairs washing my hands in the utility sink and a bolt went right passed my head and went bang on the wall in front of me. It frightened me really bad. When I looked back no one was there. My mom was doing her homework on the computer, my dad was using the bathroom and my sister was gone at her friends house. If it was one of them I would have heard them run up the stairs or something. I went and checked if my dad and mom were still where they were and they were! I still didn't tell anyone though.

Then everything just stopped after that. This happened over a period of like 4 days. I have no idea why some things will just happen out of the blue like this! Will you tell me why? Also why was it so short? I'm 13 so I'm the right age and stuff. Please tell me!

Rose in Bloom in the Middle of Winter,"Texas, United States",Family / Friends Visits,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Family / Friends Visits :: Rose in Bloom in the Middle of Winter

M y eccentric friend Laurie has told me many stories of her experiences with strange things. Here is one that involved her beloved grandmother. Laurie (which by the way is not her real name) did not have a good childhood. Laurie's mother was a very cruel woman who on paper sounds like a Disney villain. Cruella Deville would constantly physically and emotionally abuse my friend and gloried in anything that caused her pain.

Laurie would tell me that her mother would ask her constantly ""Why did she have to have such a fat ugly daughter"". My friend being a smart-arse from birth would reply ""Why did I have to born to mother who would say such a thing to her fat ugly daughter?"" Laurie told me that her mother will never die because Heaven doesn't want her and the devil would think it was a hostile take over. Awwhhh... Family the ties that bound and gag...

Laurie's mother was prone to send Laurie away when the bruises got too prominent and she would send Laurie to her grandmother's house for an extended stays. If you're wondering why the police were not called it was because this was in the days when Child protective services were not in full force and abuse was viewed as a family problem not a police problem in rural small town Texas.

Laurie's grandmother was full blooded Choctaw Indian and she believed that all things have a spirit that should be respected and loved. Laurie loved her grandmother very much and looked forward to spending time with her snapping peas on her front porch to hear her stories. This same grandmother taught her to play poker just in case she ever needed money, what a gal.

When Laurie was barely eleven or twelve years old her grandmother passed away. It was the middle of winter in Texas, which means you probably needed only a sweater to stand the ""chilly weather"". However Laurie was missing her grandmother and looking out of a window at her house. She silently asked her grandmother if she missed her. Laurie looked out into the yard at the rose-less rose bushes that were there in the front yard. Laurie has always told me like this ""A yellow rose bloomed in the middle of the rosebush and stayed that way for a minute before falling away petal by petal"". It was winter people. Roses do not grow in winter and certainly not in front of you! Laurie's grandmother sent her a message of hope that she has carried with her for over thirty years.

Old Lady Ghost Hides Stuff from Us,"Texas, United States",Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: Old Lady Ghost Hides Stuff from Us

W hen my father and his new wife moved into the house they currently reside in, they knew well that the previous owner's mother had died in the back bedroom. It was rumored that the previous owner had been a drug dealer/user who had been siphoning off of his mother's social security check and possibly over medicated her prior to her death.

After his mother died, he not only moved out, he left the country for New Zealand. My father was amused by this fact and used to joke ceaselessly about the old dead lady living in the house. If anything went wrong or went missing it was the old lady in the house. Well, my step-sister did not think this was funny considering she was a latch key kid at the time and had to spend several hours alone at the house by herself before her mother or my father would return home from work. She swears the door knobs would twist on her bedroom door and the bathroom, when she was home alone... The entire time that she lived there, until she grew up and moved out, she would turn on every light in the entire house once dark hit.

During my brother's and my weekend visits to my father's house we would often come up with missing articles that would return to their original placement after a great deal of searching. One afternoon I placed a silver ring that my sister had given me on the center table candy dish in the living room area while I brushed my hair before putting the ring on for the day. I brushed my hair and then went to place the ring on my finger but discovered that the ring was gone. I searched high and low and enlisted the help of my two brothers and my father because the ring was important to me because it was the first gift that my new step-sister had given to me and I loved it.

I should mention that my father is a veteran police officer for a large city and knows how to search for and find anything. I'm talking ripping up the sofa cushions, emptying trash can, looking in the refrigerator... Well we could not find that ring. I was forced to leave the house at the end of my weekend visit without my trinket. And I was pissed...

Two days later my dad calls me and tells me that my step-mother had found my ring sitting in the candy dish in the middle of the table that I had originally placed the ring before brushing my hair. When my step-mother found the ring in the candy dish and asked my dad if that was the ring that they had been looking for so hard and my Dad exclaimed ""Where did you find that"". Dad tried to convince my step-mother that we had searched the candy dish before and that the ring had been nowhere to be seen. My step-mother still thinks that we just over looked the ring but that is not possible because we even moved the sofa looking for it and it just showed up in the middle of the room where four people had been searching? I don't think so.

I think the old lady had the ring and when she saw I was upset she gave it back. Stupid Ol'Heifer!

Pinned Down to Bed,Australia,Old Hags / Night Attacks / Sleep Paralysis,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Old Hags / Night Attacks / Sleep Paralysis :: Pinned Down to Bed

I 've been reading some of the stories on here and felt relieved to know that what happened to me was not abnormal. Here is my story. About 15 years ago when I was still living in my family home in Sydney, Australia, there was some strange goings on in my bedroom. It was a very very cold room always.

A few times I swear I saw some kind of mist in the shape of a person by the foot of my bed. I found the room unsettling and eerie. On one occasion it felt as though someone had hopped into bed right beside me, as I felt the bed depress. I moved my foot over to that side of the bed and of course there was nothing there.

One early morning I had woken up feeling a little off and was just laying in bed with my eyes lightly shut trying to get back to sleep when something grabbed my pony tail and was pulling it through the slats of my bed head. Then I felt my shoulders being pinned down and a heavy, restricted feeling in my chest. I tried to scream, but nothing was coming out other than a low growl. I could not move at all, until suddenly I was able to move one of my arms and was trying to thump it against the wall in the hopes someone would hear and come and rescue me. Meanwhile I could hear my sister wake up and switch the cartoons on in the lounge room and my mother arise and come downstairs to make her morning coffee whilst this was all happening to me.

I kept struggling and fighting to try and get this thing to let me go. Eventually it eased off and I was able to get up. When I came out of my bedroom my sister and mother were exactly where I had heard them go to in the house, so this confirmed that I was not asleep and dreaming all of this.

I refused to sleep in that room for 2 weeks until my father had spent a couple of nights in there. I also burned a white candle one night and asked the ghost to go towards the light. Then I hung a crucifix in my window and placed a bible on my bed head. There were no more experiences for me after that.

However, when we sold the house some years later the neighbors found the new owners teenage daughter wandering the street muttering and crying, during the middle of the day. She said she was home alone and had seen a ghost. She refused to go back in the house. Very quickly the new owner moved out and leased the property to someone else. Further confirmation of ghosts in that house.

To this day I have always wondered what was happening to me. Was it an angry spirit perhaps? Whatever it was it did not like me being in that room.

In the Absence of Light,"California, United States",Psychic / Medium,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Psychic / Medium :: In the Absence of Light

F rom childhood there has been a part of town that seemed to radiate peace to me. Seems like I could be blindfolded, spun around three times and driven -in reverse- to this area and I would still know exactly where I was! That is how powerfully it moves me. And lucky me, after months of apartment hunting my fiancé fell in love with a place, and it happened to be in that area. And my new home is haunted. There is a being here full of hungry anger.

Luxuriating in the calm solace of my old home was like a nice soak in the tub. This place is like a being chucked in a shake-n-bake bag filled with cactus needles. Typically, ghosts react like dogs with me, if they are lost and scared they follow me. They know I will try to help them. I am surprised when I find ghosts that don't want positive transformation, like this one.

The first night I felt the energy disturbance of both the previous owner (her energy signature) and beings (and energies) that were attached to this place. From experience I knew that it can take at least three months to mediate all the energies. It is a process that almost always begins by quieting the destructive beings/energies. On the third night I realized this was not happening.

I was locking down for the evening and had just shut off the all the lights in the kitchen, dining room and living room. There was only one small light on inside and that was in the master bedroom, on the other side of the house. As my eyes began to focus to the darkness a shape became defined, blacker than the night and two feet in front of me. It was about three feet high, with either horns or ears, and red eyes. I could not tell if it had ever lived, but it had enormous rage and an endless sadness.

Initial fear was ratified by my disappointment. All the work that I had done up to that point hadn't made a sea change. I stood my ground and calmed myself by imagining that I would be able to help bring it to positive transformation. It sent me only barbs, and then seemed to melt away into the blackness, using the darkness as a fish uses water. It's intensely ugly pal, and my guessing where it might return, notched up my apprehension. Why would it shun the light, what does it get from merely peering out from its shadows? How could my Fiancé and I begin a life together burdened by this extra negativity?

Different things work for different people to assuage supernatural negativity. For some it is crosses on every wall, some it is burning herbs and singing trance like songs, and for others, like me, it is mostly about meditation and psychic intervention. Through my meditation I learned that this negative being is not diabolical, but is power hungry. It did not come right out with it, but it made it apparent that it wants a host to suck on, of course. At that point I could say all of my good work has not done much, but it had helped some.

It remained out of my searchlight, yet hungered to be with me and noticed. I was lying in bed; it was early evening and was just about to turn off the lights to sleep. That is when, from across the room and from the corner of my eye, I saw an outline of a face. By trespassing in my space I was able to pick up a bit more about it. And from there I knew it was masculine and sensed it was a shape changer. It was powerful as well, it would have had to be to resist my energy so well. It lingered at the threshold, simply watching me. Loving the power of its anonymity, and my desire to heal it, it pathetically gloated in its oblivion.

Then came new years, as usual I had to work and was hoping my ear plugs would sail me through the staple drunken neighbors, gun fire and fire works. My Fiancé had tuckered out in the other room, he gets up at four in the morning, so I wasn't altogether sad he was not bedding with me.

As I had feared the excitement of New Years got the better of me and I could hear the snapping fireworks, drunken drawls and hammering laughter. At 1ish, petting the cat, facing away from the door, I was wondering about the cogs and wheels of time and considering what might be in my future.

I said, ""Come in..."" hearing a knock on the open bedroom door. My adoration flashed!

I was so glad that my Fiancé decided to come and be with me for awhile before he had to get up. I waited to hear my Fiancé's soft and low voice, but instead heard nothing. From the corner of my eye I saw the hall alight and decided he was making a visit to the bathroom and would be soon in coming in.

I went back to the cat, then, several minutes later, I returned my gaze to the door. I realized the light was strange looking, whitish blue, and my boyfriend had never come in. Just as rolled over to face the door, the light evaporated. Scared out of my mind, but having just enough of it left, I got up and shut my door- locking it.

Next day I asked my fiancé, but I already knew, he had not been up in the night and had not knocked on my door. Ironically, I withdrew from the light as the being withdraws from mine. And as time goes by I am annoyed by its stalwart caginess and saddened by its sadness.

Origins of the Forest Elemental,"Virginia, United States",Non Human Entities,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Non Human Entities :: Origins of the Forest Elemental

T o fully understand this story, please read my first story Elemental of Forest . It was about November 2006 now and I have gained a close friend. Something still intrigued the both of us though; we wanted answers to what was out there. He told me all he knew of the forest in hopes that maybe it would all fall in place for us. He has been living in this house for as long as he can remember and he used to play back in the woods when he was little.

One time when he was back there, he came across a creature which was described as being approximately 7 feet tall, black skin with a chameleon-like texture, no mouth only 2 eyes that were as dark as coals, hands that had fingers that stretched for 6 inches and longer with sharp nails on the end, and (to me the scariest thing of all) it walked chicken style. Chicken style, or reverse knees, is instead of your legs being vertical with the knee cap in the middle facing forward, they bow backwards with the joint facing the opposite way. I was shocked to learn of this and terrified at the same time. He spoke about the center of the forest where there is a circle where nothing grows surrounded by bramble, devils walking sticks, briars, and other thorny dry shrubs, and at the circles center candle wax was found. This was all starting to make sense now and a plausible story forming about the possibility of rituals and séances in the woods. It would explain the activity in the area.

With this new information, we decided to head out again, but no where near where we were last time. I really didn't want to upset whatever that was that broke the tree branch. We walked along the edge of the woods again, but everything was silent. No fog, no noise, no shadows, no weird feelings, nothing. In fact, the forest felt rather inviting, but a quick thought about what may be lurking in there quickly changed my mind. I actually believe there to be multiple spirits in the forest, each one really has their own territory they like to stake out. The elemental near the back end of a field, the spirit that likes to play tricks and scare the beejeezus out of people wanders my friend's backyard and part of the forest's edge, and of course what we think to be at the center of all this activity, the demonic entity. After a much uneventful stroll nothing was going on and what is worse is we even brought another friend to experience the activity here with us only to have nothing happen at all, but everything was about to change.

About 20 minutes had passed and we were walking back to the house. All of us suddenly got a ""something is watching us"" feeling at exactly the same time. The new friend we brought with us stated she smelled fireworks. I knew the smell all too well... sulfur. I realized what was going on and immediately images began flashing in front of me. Most of them were undecipherable and didn't really mean anything kind of like static on a TV, but one stuck out to me, a goat's head. Something was getting close and we didn't want to stick around to find out what it was.

We reached the house and ran inside. We each sat down and took a load off while we watched a little TV and fired up the game cube upstairs in my friend's room. We played for probably about 45 minutes before we heard a woman scream. It was my friend's sister. She ran into the room tears streaming down her face. She muttered

""I was in my room working on my laptop and I saw a shadow and all of the sudden the power turned on and off probably 4 or 5 times!"" We comforted her and let her know we were all here for her if she wanted to talk about it. She eventually got feeling better so she ventured back into her room to get her things to finish her work elsewhere. At this point, we were all worried about what it was that scared her. Was it that thing we felt? Probably not, but we will never know.

The weeks passed and activity in and around the forest began to wane to nothing, that is until October came around again a year later. My girlfriend at the time was very interested in the paranormal. I told her the stories at this place and she insisted we make the hour and a half drive to my friend's place, so we headed over there to check it out again. For whatever reason she was particularly hung up on the elemental story and she had to see this one up close.

We arrived to a warm reception as usual and began investigating as soon as the darkness set in. This past year was an odd year. I spoke to my friend about the activity he was experiencing this year and he said that it has been extremely weak this year. He saying this really did lend a lot of credibility to the stories he told because it showed me he wasn't just trying to make me think he had all these cool and adventurous tales out at his place. It did perplex me on why activity was so low, but regardless we went back to the entrance of where the elemental lives. The whole walk there lacked even the smallest creepy feeling. We came up to the entrance right where the light with the short is. Only this time, the light didn't flicker once...

We all gladly walked back much past where I stopped last time up to another entrance of sorts. The dirt road continued but there was heavy over growth on either side and the blackness was so dark and unforgiving which is in stark comparison to before where the side of the road was sparse, open, and well lit. This was the backdoor into the forest and they were about to step in. We went in two at a time my girlfriend and my friend went first because a 3rd friend didn't want to go in there so I stayed outside with her to keep her company.

As soon as the two of them stepped into the blackness something caught my eye, a shadow in the bush behind the 3rd friend. I figured it was an animal of sorts, but again got that ""I am being watched"" feeling. We then both heard a rustle come from behind her. She turned around only to see nothing. At this point we didn't care if it was a wild dog or a spirit we didn't want to get hurt. We called for them to return which they promptly did, after we already made a hasty retreat back to the safety of the street light; which went out as soon as we approached it.

As the two of them were exiting something darted from the bushes, stopped in the middle of the road looked at the two of them and then ran into the other side of the bushes. As soon as it had made ""its"" way partially back into the bushes, both my friend and my girlfriend turned their heads because, well at the time I didn't know yet, they sensed something behind them. I knew what I saw so I asked both of them ""Why did you turn your heads around?"" They replied ""I thought I saw something behind me..."" We had seen the same thing. My friend did say whatever it was, was also in the darkness of the forest with him he had seen it upon leaving the woods, right as we heard the noises. I am still willing to call it an animal, but I will say that is one FAST animal. We walked back to his house and discussed what we felt in the forest's entrance and made our way to the car. We said our good byes and headed back home.

This is the last of my personal experiences with the woods and I only have stories and histories of the woods. Such as the story of how my friend went into the woods with a group of friends after dark and why he refuses to ever do that again and other tales of the elemental and the sly spirit in his backyard which I am willing to share using email or instant messaging. I DO however have many more personal experiences elsewhere and I look forward to putting them to words and posting them on this wonderful web site.

Ghost in the School Lavatory,Greece,Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: Ghost in the School Lavatory

I t all started with a scary rumor in around 3 or 4th grade. Of course, we all thought it was the boys' doing so they could scare us easily. Some of the girls (including me), were about to find that the rumor had a grain of truth in it.

I am sure most of you are familiar with the ""Bloody Mary"" rumor that surrounds most of the bathrooms in school. I am sure that my elementary school is haunted, no kidding. The rumor went like so (it is a bit elaborate, but I'm sure some kids in my class just buffed it up a bit to become scarier): If you wanted to see Bloody Mary's ghost, you'd have to use the last toilet and flush it three times. Then, wash your hands at the second last sink and chant her name three times. Supposedly, then you'd see red and the ghost would appear to you (and supposedly kill you, but that never happened, of course)...

We had all brushed this off as a scary story just to make students weary and scared in the halls (my school has long halls, and they're dark too.) We were at our lunch break and most of the girl students were yammering and munching on their sandwiches. We heard a door slam, a scream, and running feet. One of our classmates was before us, sobbing like she'd never cried before. Her face was pale and her hands were shaking. Everyone was in disarray. We thought her legs were ready to give out.

We all crowded around her and asked her what was wrong. She continued crying for a minute or so, but we couldn't understand what she was saying. When she finally calmed down, we sat her at a bench and she started to speak, while taking out her lunch and gulping down water violently.

She said she was washing her hands and she looked up in the mirror to comb her hair. She said that her vision became red and when it focused, she saw a lady in an elaborate dress in the mirror standing behind her. The lady stretched out her hands, and the tips of her fingers were just a hint of red. She then said that she had swerved to see her clearer, but when she turned around, the lady was gone. Following that, as she walked out of the bathroom, the door slammed forcibly behind her. That was the last straw. She came running, and that's when the things stopped.

Naturally, everyone comforted her and the end of the day came. By the end of the classes, everyone was already talking about the incident in the afternoon. I, for one, thought that she had been so intoxicated by the rumors that she had just seen it all for herself. The doors in the bathroom are either red, green, or blue, and I thought she had been staring too long at the red and seen it before her. Boy oh boy, was I wrong.

A few days later, I was washing my hands in the elementary bathroom. I looked up, and lo behold, behind me was a lady in an elaborate dress and her hair pinned up in a style I had only seen in books. I froze like a statue. The water ran on my hands, unnoticed by now. We just stared at each other for some time. Suddenly, a door slammed on one of the bathroom cabinets. I jumped in fright. I turned and the lady was gone. The door slammed two or three times before I came to my senses. Forgetting to wipe my hands and leaving the tap open, I raced through the bathroom entrance.

After that, I haven't seen that lady since. But weird things happened in the bathroom after. I'd be washing my hands and I'd hear a door close. I'd ask ""Who's there?"", and I'd hear footsteps, and they'd lead out of the bathroom, but no one would be there. Several times doors would open and close on their own accord and the bathroom's climate would change drastically. One minute it would be warm because of the heating system (in the winter), and you'd visit it five minutes later; the air would be cold, and you could almost see your breath.

I put my hand to the radiator; It was still working, but the heat didn't seem to affect the atmosphere. After that, the girls in my class and I started using the bathroom upstairs. We had to climb an extra flight of stairs, but no one cared. Better to use a normal bathroom than a haunted one.

Someone Wants to Bring Me Down,Greece,Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: Someone Wants to Bring Me Down

I always sit in my armchair and either browse on the laptop or read a book next to the fire. I am absolutely certain the apartment I used to live in was haunted, but I have moved twice. Things haven't stopped happening though. I get a feeling like someone is watching me, and when you're alone in the house or you're taking a shower, the feeling doesn't feel very good.

As I was saying, I was sitting in the armchair. I was thirsty, so I got up for a drink of water. The minute I get up: BAM! Something pulls both my ankles and I nearly fall. I didn't, though. This happened more than four times. I don't think there is something wrong with my legs. I earnestly feel like I'm being pulled!

I have a pet rabbit. Rabbits are very sensitive, and they get disturbed when they feel things coming on. An earthquake, eclipse, etc. When they are feeling uncomfortable, they stay in one spot and don't stop trembling. Ears erect and ready to run. When they bolt, they snap their feet so fast that they hit the floor; Thus making a loud sound. My rabbit runs around like this for no reason. There is NO ONE but my family and me around, and he knows all of us.

One night, he got especially scared and scrambled into a corner. He was jammed and I had gotten him out before he did anything to himself. I went up to take my shower. As I was drying myself off and changing, I felt again someone watching me. I said: ""If there is anyone in this house that is watching me, have the courtesy not to watch while I'm taking a shower or changing..."" The presence left almost immediately.

The Old Man that Stands Near my Bed,Australia,Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: The Old Man that Stands Near my Bed

B efore I tell you my story I would like you not to judge me of my age, as I am only 14. Well, about 2 years ago I moved into a new house not far away from my old house actually. I didn't really like it because the windows are almost standing height. I had never liked my room and still I stay in that room every night.

Yet one night because I am a very light sleeper and I always wake up during the night, I woke up and I was looking around my room and then at the end of my bed I saw this old man, he looked sort of rich I guess, you could say, he was in a tuxedo and looked very fancy, like he was going out.

I got severely terrified, I couldn't move, I couldn't make a sound I just lied there looking terrified after about a minute it just disappeared, I layed there for 3 hours not being able to move not knowing what had happened.

The next day I went up to my friend and I told my friend what had happened, she was the type who be lived in the paranormal and I never believed in that stuff until that day. Ever since then me and my friend have had sleepovers at my place and took many pictures in my room and found many, many disturbing things that still give me nightmares I still have the pictures on my mobile.

But ever since the night I saw that man strange things happen in my house I'm really scared of my house at night, I hear strange things, but my dad doesn't believe in that stuff so he won't let us move.

Strange Happenings in my Home,"Florida, United States",Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: Strange Happenings in my Home

O ur family has had many experiences and we even have a ""family"" ghost story and someday I will write about it but tonight I am going to write about happenings in my home: Shortly after Hurricane Charley hit our home, we began renovations to the house. My partner ""S"" stated that on a few occasions he saw a little man, not much taller than the back of our dining room chairs, wearing a derby hat, walk through the sliding glass door (it was closed) past the table and go into the wall between the fridge and the new kitchen cabinets.

Since I had the house built in 1993 and was the only person who lived in this house, I decided that it was an imprint left over from sometime in the past, until one day when ""S"" was bringing the mail into the bedroom, he caught this little man standing by the head of our bed, the little man saw him, acted startled and ran behind the bed into the wall. This room was also being worked on and the bed was pulled away from the wall so that is why the little man could run around the bed and go into the wall. Haven't seen him since then.

""S"" hadn't told me this story until one day when I approached him and told him that I thought we had a ghost in the house because I keep seeing a shadow of a tall thin man wearing a fedora hat, peering around the corner at me. He has seen him too and he said he was trying to think of a way to tell me and was glad I brought it up.

This dark figure has been spotted by many people, we call him the ""Traveler"", My sister sees one in her home, a friend of my adult daughter has seen one, a patient in the hospital where I work saw one yesterday, and I have noticed many others have described him on various ""ghost"" sites. Would like to hear like stories about him.

My dog tends to look like he is looking a someone and several time he pushes his toy toward where he is looking as if he wants someone to play with him. He also looks towards the kitchen a lot and barks.

Other smaller instances are: 1. Dog gate not only fell over in the night it flipped and face a different direction then it would have it it just fell on it's side. 2. I woke in the middle of the night and saw what looked like glowing wings on the wall. 3. I placed the tv remote control on top of my bed pillow, left the room to talk to ""S"" and when I came back into the room it was missing, I found it inside the pillow case. 4. I came home from work one night and when I went into the kitchen I noticed that tip was missing from the faucet and I asked ""S"" how the faucet got broken and he said it wasn't, I went back to check it out, I touched the sharp edge, even convinced myself that there wasn't a tip for this faucet and went to bed. The next morning the tip was back on the faucet. 5. I was resting in my hot tub one night and I tend to fall asleep in it. In my sleep (dream) a voice said ""are you the person in the hot tub?"" and I answered ""yes"" it then said ""prepare yourself for cold water"" I woke up with a start and laughed and thought what a strange dream, all of the sudden the recycle jets on the spa turned on and out rushed cold water and blasted my sides. I was glad I was awake when the cold water hit! 6. Last night at two different times there was a bell of some sort ringing loudly, The first one woke me up, ""S"" was coming back to bed (bathroom) and the second time he was in bed and it woke us up, the dog started to bark. That morning we tried to duplicate the sound, trying our smoke detector, microwave, alarm clock, timers and the phone but nothing made a similar sound.

So what do you think going on in my house? I just want you to know that I am in my 50's ""S"" is in his 60's we don't do drugs, rarely drink and have no reason to brag about ghosts in our home. I've been on many ghost hunts with a professional team and I was the one who tried to disprove events and had to be convinced that what was really happening was true.

Our Son's Help at the Hospital,"Indiana, United States",Psychic / Medium,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Psychic / Medium :: Our Son's Help at the Hospital

O ur almost five year old son is normally a unnaturally healthy young man. In most situations he can survive another threat of any nasty bug that hits his sitters home with the grace of someone whose immune system is in advanced stages of perfection. However, this past Sunday at a Superbowl party at the local VFW, he came in contact with one that he could not fight off on his own.

By the time Super Tuesday rolled around he could not keep water down, even with the use of Phenergan liquid and brown rice broth. In our concern, we contacted his personal doctor who directed us to immediately take him to the emergency room in the local hospital. My husband rushed to the sitters, and took him there as I was several cities away and it would take me, legally, two hours to get to him.

Just as a side note: It took me less than an hour that day to arrive at the hospital. When I rushed into the room, he beamed his smile in my direction and filled me in on what had already transpired. His Daddy by his side, he said ""Why do you look worried? It's Daddy's turn..."" I had to smile. He has such a simplistic way of looking at things, and in that, we see his wisdom.

After about an hour of sitting and waiting to make sure the extra medications would help him fight this off, we heard the unmistakable sounds of an ambulance arriving. As I was still in scrubs, I was asked to help in the transference of the inflicted into the room where he would be examined. I hastily tried to explain that I have no medical training and was in no position to administer any type of medical assistance. I was still urged down the hall to the waiting opened doors of the ER.

The gentleman had a self inflicted wound to his chest and the outlook was not good. No one was talking to him. They talked amongst themselves in the normal medical lingo that most of us struggle through and steadfastly would not look down on the gurney at this man.

I looked down at him as we were rushing to the exam room and caught his eye, then greeted him. I asked his name, age, how he came to be where he was at that time. I asked about his family, about pets. That was quite a long hallway and I felt I knew the basics about him by the time we got him settled into the room that the medical staff soon vacated. When I finally looked up, out of the depths of those desperate, deep brown eyes, I realized that we were alone save for the nurse prepping him for his procedure. Deep inside, I cried out for his safety and for the release of this fear that bound him.

While walking back to my son's room, a single thought repeated itself frequently. ""Do not leave him..."" I kept answering that thought with, I am not. I am heading to his room now. My husband took one look at me and wryly smiled, knowing my inner turmoil. My son said ""Go back. He needs you, too...""

As I struggled with the idea to return to the man, as opposed to staying with our son, our son hopped off the bed and took my hand. He walked down the hall, around the corner, down another hall and into the man's room. I did not tell him where to go, neither did I tell him it was a man that I had talked to. No one stopped us as we took that walk. We passed two nurses and the doctor who was treating our son. We passed two nursing stations, and still no one stopped us.

I stood in the curtain-way and watched my son go to the bed and reach down to pick up the man's hand as it hung over the side of the bed. Startled, he looked up and saw me standing there. I then explained that our son was there for treatment also, and that he wanted to see the man. Tears glistened in the man's eyes and he touched our son's face so gently, I knew him to have children of his own.

The two ""men"" talked for a bit, and soon my husband was walking down the hall searching us out. Our son was being released as the doctor had seen to him while I was helping out the ER staff, and he was being sent home. The man understood and thanked us for taking the time to sit with him. He said he felt like no one was there to help him and he wanted to go home.

Our son stopped in the curtain-way, turned around and walked back up to the gentleman. He again took his hand and said ""When you get back home, please tell Jerome you will never leave again. You tell him that you are there to stay. He does not like being alone...""

The man positively crumbled. I could actually see him shrink in stature and deflate within himself. He looked up at me and asked ""Who is this little man?""

What we had no clue of knowing was that while the Father was rushed to the same hospital that we were in, his son was taken to the children's hospital in Indianapolis. Apparently what had happened was that they were ""practicing"" a dangerous ""sport"" and the son was mortally wounded. The father had not yet been told of his son's fate. After the helicopter came to take his son, the father was so distressed that he wounded himself in the same manner that his son was wounded. This took only seconds as no one had yet removed the weapon in question.

And on the news this morning, was the telling of the fathers fate as well.

The Shadow Visitors,"Florida, United States",Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: The Shadow Visitors

I 'm back and 'THEY' are back! I'm writing of my recent experiences because I don't understand why they are back. The paranormal activity that has been going on in my home is not really frightening per say, but a little unnerving I guess. Only because I have had many different experiences, from psychic phenomena to ghostly talking or crying to physical manifestations and I don't know what 'THEY' want from me.

This has been going on for a couple of months, maybe a little longer, but I haven't submitted my experiences on here because I would try to write it off as something logical. That's just how I am. Besides, it started off as little things here and there and now it's getting more frequent, stronger and stranger!

So, here we go! A couple of months back I was sick with a bad cold and I started hearing little children playing. Yes, I do have children, but this was at night when everyone else was asleep but me of course.

Then, the next weird thing that started happening immediatly after this was the short little 'flicks' of shadow people, so I think, out of my peripheral vision. They were low to the ground and very quick in movement, the tell-tale definition of a true 'Shadow Person'. ""Little children playing"", ""Low to the ground, little flicks of darkness"". Hmmmmm...

The next thing I experienced was more on either the telepathic perspective or psychic (which I do not consider myself psychic by any means), or both. I was having visions of something happening, something very silly or small I would say, and it would happen when I was awake. Then, after those incidences, I dreamt of my Mother-In-Laws living room being all nice and cleaned up, not cluttered (you see she is somewhat of a collector you could say). I dreamt that we were all sitting in this cleaned up, non-cluttered, pack rat of a living room enjoying time with each other.

That same morning my husband went to work out and then went to his Mother's house to unclutter the foyer so he could open the french doors to the living room so he could clean it up and we could visit with his Mother at her home and be comfortable. I had no idea he was doing this that day, or any day for that matter. I was surprised that this was what he had planned for the day at his Mother's since I had that dream.

I told him after the fact about my dream and asked him if he was thinking about doing that as he was walking out of the bedroom to leave the house while I was still sleeping. What I am getting at, and I am really trying to explain this the best I can so I hope you do understand, is that I KNOW that I dreamt this during the morning hours in the midst of him leaving because I am a light sleeper and he woke me up coming in and out of the bedroom. However, I did not wake up at the time he walked out of the bedroom to leave the house.

What I am wondering is if there was some telepathic connection between us since we are so close. We are not just Husband and Wife but very Best Friends. What do you think? I would consider it to be a telepathic connection rather than something psychic.

The next thing is that I was in the backyard smoking a cigarette, late at night. I was by myself, sitting in one of my white plastic, backyard furniture chairs with my feet propped up on another white plastic chair. So I am sitting their enjoying my cigarette with my Pomeranian pup in my lap and I noticed this orb go across the back of the chair that my feet were propped up on. Now, no one else was up in the house, the house was dark as well as the backyard were I was at. However, me trying to debunk a situation like that, I go ahead and look all over to see if it was a reflection of something. No luck with that, there was nothing logical or normal about it. So I lean back in my chair, continue to do what I was doing and another one goes by on the chair in the same manner. Then a third time. That was the last of it. By the way, these orbs, were not completely round and they were slow moving, from left to right they would move. Oh yea, and they were all BLUE! I have been hearing about experiences with 'BLUE ORBS' from my two good friends on this site. Hmmmmm... Is there a connection?

Last, but certainly not least, my husband woke up early the other morning and instead of waking me up by turning on the tv in the bedroom, he got his pillow and a blanket and went into the living room. He said that while he was out there he saw a 'Shadow Person', very dense, by our fire place which would be to the right of our tv. He said it just stood there for a few minutes staring, no eyes that I am aware of, but you know how you can feel that certain stare whether you see someone or some 'things' face or not? He then proceeded to tell me that it turned towards the tv and disappeared right into the side of it. Our tv is one of those big, wide, tall ones that stand the height of a 5'6"" person. So he just turned and walked right into to it. BLAHHH... FREAKY!

The other night I heard a woman talking and then a weeping sound in the distant. Again, this is while everyone is asleep! What is going on? I thought I was mainly rid of this beings, but now they are back and I don't know why or what they want. Why are they back all of a sudden?! I mean I still have paranormal things happen here and there but not as often and not as aggressive. It seems to be getting stronger and more persistent.

I have a pretty tight connection with two people on this site and I'm wondering if this has anything to do with it. No blame at all, just wondering if their paranormal 'happenings' are coming to me. I know I have had these things happen to me in the past but why has it come back so suddenly?! Very strange.

And to my fellow stooges (he, he, he), I hope that me saying that it is a possibility that your paranormal activity might be coming to me, is not offensive because I am definitely not laying blame, I'm just curious about all of this. You know just an idea so to speak! :)

Child in the Farmhouse,France,Misc,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Misc :: Child in the Farmhouse

A couple of years back, my parents and I were planning our annual family holiday to Brittany, France. Usually, we booked the gites through reputable brochures and suchlike. However, this one summer, we decided to try finding a gite on the Internet.

We soon stumbled across a rather lovely looking farmhouse in the south of Brittany. It was everything we were after. Rustic looking, but all mod cons, large garden, in the centre of a village - not far from a main town or the beach. The owner's contact details were on the web site and so we gave him a ring. He seemed like a genuine nice guy and was pleased to offer us the farmhouse for our two week holiday.

So off we went. Happy and joyous, and thoroughly looking forward to our holiday. It's about day's drive to Brittany from our house in England, and so by the time we reached the village, the sun was setting and we were all pretty knackered. We drove through the village slowly, following the owner's directions. The farmhouse was meant to be right at the end of the village and so, we kept driving, past a school... Some ramshackle farm buildings... A few houses... And then suddenly, we were on the road again... Driving past fields. We turned around, driving back, certain we had missed a turning or something, somewhere.

Then it hit us. Those ramshackle old farm buildings included our farmhouse gite.

We could not believe it at first. It had to be some kind of sick joke. But it wasn't. In the centre of some kind of courtyard, surrounded by crumbling sandstone buildings, sat the farmhouse. The moment we drove into the yard, an eerie feeling swept over us. None of us mentioned it until afterwards, but we all said that we each felt instinctively that we weren't welcome there. The courtyard was full of weeds, paint was peeling off the outside walls... The windows were open, and net curtains were blowing in the wind. Honeysuckle grew over and around the door and there was an melancholy coldness to the place. We wandered around into the backgarden, were fresh washing was on the line...and, wait for it... A live peacock was tethered to a post in a chicken wire cage!

Unnerved, but aware we were paying quite a lot for this holiday, we decided to look inside. The kitchen looked like something out of the dark ages. Cracked tiles and cobbles on the floor... An iron cooker... Cupboard doors hanging off their hinges. Then think of the darkest, dankest most disgusting shade of mulberry you can. That's what the walls were smothered in.

Upstairs, there were three bedrooms. The room with a double bed, the biggest, was the most normal looking of all of them, despite the uneven flooring, mussed up bedclothes strewn everywhere and broken glass across the floor. The room which would be mine was on a huge slant, and my ""wardrobe"" was a branch nailed outside the door behind a curtain.

A four poster bed was squashed into a tiny room, taking up the majority of the space. Its curtains, thick, dark velvet, were ripped and hanging off the rails around the bed. The moment I entered that room, I felt as if someone was watching me. You know the feeling you get when someone's reading over your shoulder? Like that.

We stared, dumbstruck at the sight before us, appalled that anyone could treat their house like this. But then, I glanced up at the wall, and saw a small painting hanging. It was of a countryside scene - but what really disturbed me was the figure in the painting. A little girl, dressed in a white frock stood, staring out. But what really got me going was that she was pointing at the bed.

After a quick family conference, we all decided that we couldn't... or rather wouldn't stay in that house. We tried going to a B'n'B, but after a few days of trying to salvage it, we went home, feeling as though our holiday had been ruined from the start.

I swear, to this day, that there was something really wrong with that painting, and that house. Nothing happened... No objects flew... No tapping on shoulders or anything like that, but something really did not want us there, and to this day, I get chills whenever I wonder about what might have happened if we had decided to stay in that house.

Gas Station Convenience Store,"Michigan, United States",Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: Gas Station Convenience Store

T his took place in Michigan. In the late 1990's. I worked the afternoon shift, 3pm until midnight. At a gas station convenience store, called Stop and Shop I worked those hours for about a year and a half. I worked alone in this store on my shift. Once in awhile I worked until 5am the next morning when others never showed up to work.

Where this store was located was on the main drag more in the country where the houses were far between. A store was to the right of it but, it closed at 5pm. Other then that was a house kiddie corner from this stop and shop store and one house way down the road from it. No street lights. Only the lights to where the gas pumps were.

I worked for about nine months, before anything took place here. Then one night near midnight I heard the cans in the back room making noise as if someone was throwing them into a container of sorts. In between my customers that night, I went to look in the back room to see if anyone was there. I seen no one. So thought maybe it was mice or something. I went back to work.

All was quiet then about 1 am heard the noise again. I just figure it was mice and kept doing my work. When my manager came in at 5am I told her I heard noise in the back room, where we kept the filled and empty cans from beer and soda. She said she call in the guy who checks for mice and bugs. I left and went home.

My manager called me the next day told me the guy found no signs of mice or bugs, and that they could not figure out what I heard. There was no holes in the walls that anything from the outside could come in so I said okay.

I went back to work a few nights later and nearing midnight I heard the noise again, still didn't think nothing of it. I went to the back room to get some items to stock the cooler with. When I came out there was five guys in the store. I smiled at them and went to the counter where the cash register was. One guy stood next to the counter with his back to me. He appeared to have something in his coat pocket that he kept his right hand into. And by what I could see of him he was Hispanic. He never spoke at all. And the other four guys, where Caucasian they got beer, chips all kinds of snacks.

One guy came up and brought some of the stuff, put it on the counter, and one of the Caucasian told me this was a robbery. I told them ""Let me help you get the money out"" which I took the whole drawer out and set it on the counter. While doing that pushed the silent alarm with my leg. They told me thanks and left the store.

The police came and a report taken. I was off work for two days. I came back and just before midnight I heard that noise in the back room of the cans being tossed into something. I still was not afraid thinking of what it could be and did not relate it to nothing.

A week later the noise happen again just before midnight. At exactly midnight the five same guys came back into the store. And I already knew what they are going to do, and I am alone but kept my cool. Yes they robbed me again and, again I used the silent alarm for the police and file another report told the police it happens right at midnight.

I then went to the daytime shift after the second time I was robbed. Then this gal that worked with us Crystal (not this gal's real name), was pregnant and in labor. She had to leave work so I went in, to cover the rest of her shift. Got there about 8pm. At just before midnight the cans noise happen again. And I thought ""oh no am I going to be robbed again"". Sure enough right at midnight in came the same five guys and the Hispanic man always stood in front of me with his hand in his pocket. He never spoke it was always one of the other guys.

The police came, I made out another report. I called my manager told her to come and run the store the rest of the night or I was closing up the store and going home where I would be safe. She told me I had to stay there or be fired. I said fine I am fired. I handed the police officer the keys said ""it's got to be locked up before you leave I have been fired"".

I tried to find out why that happen, that I heard the noise just before midnight and the robberies were always at midnight while I worked. Never found out anything about the store if anything happen there. But certainly something warned me of what was going to happen.

Two months later those same guys robbed that same store a total of six times. And so the police staked the store out and finally they were caught. They were very polite robbers, as they always told me thanks for helping them. They did that to the others they robbed too.

I seen Crystal after she had her baby, she told me when she was robbed at noon twice, she heard noises in the back room. Not sure if the manager heard anything before the robbers came in or not.

Evil Spared Us,Australia,Ouija Board / Seances,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Ouija Board / Seances :: Evil Spared Us

S ome of you know me, I'm back with an update. It began as soon as I arrived at my friends house for the night. I could feel an entity, nor good nor bad, or it was too powerful for me to feel. So, me and my friend loved ghosts, well I did, my friend was a very skeptic but now he is addicted to ouija.

On that night we made an ouija board from internet instructions. We went outside and looked at a dark alley way with a street light over it. We went under the light in the end of the alley way and were about to begin our scene. Suddenly the light went out and we began to run, but I foolishly were wearing skate shoes, very floppy and as soon as I took of, my shoe went flying of. It was pitch black and I was running but stopped, began to think to get my shoe back while everyone else hid behind a car. I ran into the alley way and searched for my shoe, I found it and I felt an urge to look up to the alley way.

As I raised my head a saw a dark shadow looking at me and from then on I felt at peace with it, but also scared of it, the same feeling I had when I arrived at my friends house. So I ran and we went inside and made another one and went outside again. The light was fixed, although the glass was smashed and the paper was torn and no one recalled standing on it. So we had another go and had some good experiences and then we went to bed and it was another day.

I went to another friends house who wasn't a skeptic but believed in ghosts. He himself claimed to see a ghost in his hall and that at his cousin's house saw a demon. Well I made a new ouija board at his house and began to play in his laundry. We asked for a good spirit but can't remember anything about that particular conversation. The only thing I remember is the door opening by itself. So after that we went into my friends bedroom and began to play (the freaky part).

We asked for good spirits and all bad spirits to leave. We didn't get anything for 20 minutes until I asked ""is there any good spirits with us"", it moved to no. That explains why for 20 minutes we didn't get anything because no good spirits were about.

After it moved to no, we moved the glass to goodbye and both said it. At this moment we both urged each other to stop but then we ended up me watching and my friend playing, (never play with 1 person because not enough energy to keep it at bay). My friend just put his fingers on the cup and said hello, the cup began to flip but my friend tried to keep it down. Suddenly the whole cup flipped over and my friend turned it over and said goodbye.

At this point doors were opening and closing by itself and there was banging on the door next to ours. We ran outside with the ouija and found some matches and burnt the board to ashes, at that time the gate next to us was moving and we were terrified. We ran inside and the banging was louder and louder and we knew what ever it was was angry. We read the bible over and over again and prayed and it stopped, I am a strong catholic and my friend is Christian. Before I read a book that catholics can keep evil away so I think it might of worked. I left that then and everything has been alright except for now, 2 weeks later.

At night and day I see shadows white and dark in the corner of my eye, at my mum's door was moving by itself half open to almost shut and I saw a shadow stand in the door line and disappear, it is freaky stuff but I have learned to show no fear and ask it to leave.

To Believe or Not to Believe,Australia,Psychic / Medium,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Psychic / Medium :: To Believe or Not to Believe

E ver since I was a child, my mother would tell me of our family's experiences with ghosts or run-ins with spirits. My grandpa, for example, have had his fare share of run-ins since he was a child in the Philippines. When he was about 6yrs or 7yrs, he would accompany his father to the local church at 1am in the morning for prayers. (Why they would go at an unearthly hour, I could never understand).

Whilst they were there, his father would explain to him that no matter what he sees or hears, he must not make a sound or be afraid. As they would kneel at one of the pews in church and bow their heads, my grandpa's father would begin his prayers. Not long after, my grandpa would look up at the alter and in the dark he could make out some glow in forms of people appearing out from the wall of the alter and heading down the aisle and out towards the graveyard next to the church. He would hear some whimper sounds, and swooshing as these so called spirits would walk past.

As a child, I was fascinated by these fairytales. These stories that my mother would tell me, I would just pass them off as bedtime stories. My mother has also had her own experiences in a way that she sees the dead. When I say, ""sees the dead"" I mean literally, she would see the deceased as though they were live people, in their live form. She would see them crying or going about their chores as though they have no idea that they had already passed this living world. Of course, again, I would just pass these stories on as another bedtime story. I mean, c'mon, what child would boast that their family history has ways of communicating with spirits?

As I grew older, the stories became a part of my growing up and I didn't think twice about them... Until my first encounter...

I remember back in 1993, I had just moved into a unit with my boyfriend, and at that time, he was a hard worker and worked day shift, then come home to eat dinner and shoot off to study at TAFE College until 9pm or 10pm. On this one particular day, around 2pm, I felt tired and thought to have an afternoon nap before my boyfriend would come home at 3pm to eat and go off to classes. So I laid down on our bed, and, you know that state when you're resting but your mind is still conscious to your surroundings? Well, I was in that state, when I felt someone lay down next to me on the bed and lean against my back. So, here we were, back to back and all the while, I was thinking it was my boyfriend.

Unusual though, my boyfriend usually kisses me on the cheek and hug me, so feeling more conscious now, I opened my eyes and turned round to hug my boyfriend only to find nothing, and no one on the bed, but me, yet I felt as though there had been a presence there. It freaked me out but nothing else happened since that moment...

We moved from that unit after a year, and now my boyfriend has become my faithful husband and we have children of own. We just celebrated 14yrs of married bliss and I still get experiences that just cannot be explained.

The most recent, it was about 7am in the morning and the house was quiet and we were all still in bed, of course I had to get up to pee, walking into the hall way I glanced up and could see our TV in the lounge from where I was standing and saw a girl with long straight, black hair sitting in a chair right in front of the TV. Thinking it was my eldest girl, I thought it odd that she would be sitting in front of the TV with it off. So I glanced up into the lounge again and the girl was gone. I was standing right next to the girl's bedroom door and opened it only to find my eldest daughter still in her bed, fast asleep.

Again, thinking I was going crazy, I quickly went to the loo to do my business, then went back to the bedroom to wake up hubby and tell him what happened. In his sleepy state, he just murmured, ""Perhaps they want to contact you for some reason!"" then rolled over and slept some more... This story is just part of what happens in my life, and still I am unable to understand why it happens or what is it that these spirits want from me.

Although, it happens, I keep thinking I'm going crazy or I've lost my mind, but then when I tell closest friends about these experiences, they would either say, it's kool or be repulsed by the idea of me seeing the dead. Perhaps, some other readers might have had same or similar experiences as I have had and can shed some light as to how I can deal with them.

I have only had one experience where I've felt a very bad presence around, if you want to know about it, by all means, drop me a line and ask about it. I feel I'm trapped between sanity and insane... To believe or not to believe... What path do I take? Or should I take?

Slap on my Wrist,"Oklahoma, United States",Apparitions / Voices / Touches,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Apparitions / Voices / Touches :: Slap on my Wrist

T his happened about 2 years a ago (I was about 13). I had just finished a book about this psychic who had a ghost come to her for help on passing on, the book was based on a true story. Well, since the book dealt with contacting the other side, I wanted to see if it worked.

I was bored so after finishing the book I started concentrating really hard trying to communicate with the other side. I was focusing on the name Aaron (which was the ghost's name in the book, though it had been changed to protect the people involved). And as I was focusing I felt a slap on my wrist. I got freaked (and it broke my concentration) so I immediately stopped and turned on the TV.

The next day I told my mom and she said that it was probably giving me a warning, that I was supposedly opening an unknown portal and whatever slapped me was warning me about that. She also said it could have been my guardian angel. I really don't think it was a ghost because our house is blessed, so it stops ""evil spirits"" or just spirits from entering, or so we believe.

Another incident that has happened 2 times in the past are knockings on my window. It's a one story house, but it still freaked me out, obviously. We have a dog, and when those incidents happened he didn't bark and it usually barks when someone he doesn't know is near, and it didn't so I'm not sure what it was.

Some Entity is Ruining our Relationship,"Pennsylvania, United States",Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: Some Entity is Ruining our Relationship

M y boyfriend and I have been together for little more than a year. We have had our ups and downs just like every other relationship. Sometimes we fight and we stay mad at each other for days, but that all stopped about two months ago. I don't remember ever being as happy as I was during those two months.

My boyfriend's parents had a beautiful relationship, and about three weeks ago his dad asked his mom for a divorce, it was a surprise to everyone. They weren't speaking to each other at all.

About two or three days after that, I'm laying with my boyfriend on his bed watching a movie. We turn the movie off and he gets up to paint, I decided to play a video game. Then I heard something weird like the stereo of a car coming from outside, it sounded like the person had a talk show on, but for some reason it caught my attention and I became very curious on what was being said on the stereo. I couldn't make it out, so I turned the volume of the game down, as I'm turning the volume down I heard a voice coming out of the speaker I had just turned the volume down for. The speaker was right next to my left ear. My boyfriend heard it too. I laughed and turned the volume of the surround sound off. Then I heard a very deep raspy voice say my boyfriend's name then mine. We both just looked at each other very puzzled, then the voice repeated the names in that same order two more times.

The next day my boyfriend and I started fighting over nothing and the fights usually happen around 8:30 at night which is when we heard the voice. Every day since then we have been fighting. We wake up the next morning like nothing has happened we're not mad and we can't explain to each other why we fought. The strangest thing happened, my boyfriend's parents are speaking to each other like nothing happened between them and me and my boyfriend are fighting. The arguments usually start in that room.

Four days ago I'm in my house and I'm getting ready to go to a job interview. I was home alone, my mom was at work. I was getting out of the shower when I heard someone calling me from downstairs, I thought my mom had gotten out early or she forgot something. I go downstairs and there wasn't anyone there. I decided to not pay it any mind.

I started ironing my shirt and I heard the bathroom door slam shut, I had closed the door when I left the bathroom so I can't find any explanation for it. I was ready to go and for some reason every time I walked towards the door, I remembered I had forgotten something I went back to get it, it happened a couple of times. It was as if I wasn't able to leave my house. My brother came from school, and that's when I felt free to leave. I don't know how to explain it but I felt trapped.

I have been looking for answers all over the internet and I can't find any explanation. I don't want my relationship to get ruined because of something neither one of us can control.

Strange Vision of a Demon or Incubus,"New York, United States",Old Hags / Night Attacks / Sleep Paralysis,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Old Hags / Night Attacks / Sleep Paralysis :: Strange Vision of a Demon or Incubus

I am a 19 year old man from NYC, Brooklyn. I have always been into the paranormal and the occult. One day when I was 14 years old I just learned about Ouija boards and I found out that parker brothers makes them and that I can buy the ouija boards at my local toy store. Well, I eventually saved enough money and bought the Parker brothers Ouija board.

The first few days after using the board several times I was not getting any results (I was using the board alone in the daytime and at night). One day at around 1pm when I was using the ouija board I started yelling out ""are there any non-human entities or deities that want to speak to me"". I kept on asking this question as well as similar questions for about 45 minute. I finally ended the ouija board session and went to my room and listened to my stereo and just relaxed in my room.

I had this strange feeling that someone or something was watching me and circling me since I stopped using the ouija board. This feeling was really intense and never went away no matter where I went in my house. I decided to go to sleep early that night because I thought that maybe the feeling would go away the next day. I went to bed after watching t.v for about an hour at nine pm. I was feeling more than fear, I just knew someone or something was watching me.

After a few minutes of laying in bed I suddenly became paralyzed and when I closed my eyes (more like blinked) I saw this face, it was a face of what I think was a demon or incubus. Its skin was charcoal black almost everywhere except it had a few white stripes on its face (from one side of his face to another). Its eyes were yellow, it had white horns all over its head (where the hair on your head is supposed to be) Its teeth were white, narrow and pointy. The whole experience lasted no more than 5 or 6 seconds (from the paralysis onward). After I opened my eyes I felt much safer than I did that whole day. I knew that whatever it was had left me alone.

For weeks after I was bewildered by the whole incident. I could not explain what had happened and why the details were so precise, I even saw the things pores! The picture remains clear in my memory as if if it had happened yesterday.

Bob's At It Again,"New Hampshire, United States",Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: Bob's At It Again

T his is my second story I have written here. My first was Our New Apartment . If you read that story it'll explain some things that might be a bit confusing to you in this story. Well, it seems like ""Bob"" is up to some new tricks as of lately, although nothing harmful.

Lately, when I am washing clothes, the washer will stop for no apparent reason. Almost like the knob has been pushed in but, it is not. I push in the knob and pull it back out and the washer will start right up. I should note that it stops at different spots in the cycle, never the same spot and not all the time I wash either. I have had a repair man look at it (twice) and they can find nothing wrong with it.

My computer has also taken to turning on when it is off. I have everything computer related plugged into a surge protection strip and it still happens. I have tried the top and bottom outlets and it continues. Recently I re-arranged things in my apartment and the computer was one of the things moved to a different room and it has stopped turning on at night.

We have gotten a kitten, well last May, and I think he sees and hears things that we do not. I have had cats/kittens before that would perk up at different things, but this one is different. It's like he is ""really"" looking at something. He doesn't appear to be frightened and only mildly interested.

My kids have also been hearing things. It has happened to both my son and daughter. They'll be up in their rooms and at different times they come find me downstairs and ask ""what did I want?"" and I'll look at them like their crazy and they will swear that I called them. It happens to them separately, never together. Maybe Bob thinks they are sitting around to much (LOL).

Visit from a Soldier,"Pennsylvania, United States",Apparitions / Voices / Touches,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Apparitions / Voices / Touches :: Visit from a Soldier

T his story happened to me when I was 15 but it didn't seem to be evil, it seemed like it just wanted to tell me that it was there and that it was just visiting. About 2 years ago I was home alone (I have a graveyard in the backyard.) I was waken up to this loud bang coming from my room (I was on the couch - one storey house). When I got up and investigated my room, I found nothing wrong so I was thinking the house shifted but then when I started to walk out, I heard my name and I turned around and I saw this soldier (in my graveyard we have soldiers from WW2 and the revolutionary war), but then when I blinked and he was gone. So I just figured I was dreaming or just crazy.

But then the next night I was laying in my bed and I smelled a gun-smoke kind of smell and then it vanished and I got up and went and told my mom and she just blew it off like ""it's not true your just imagining it"".

But then about 2 weeks after I told her, I was with her and we were sitting in the kitchen just talking and I heard the noise again and this time, she kind of believed me and said she was sorry about not believing me when I told her the first time. So 2 years later this spirit hasn't come back, so I figured he was just visiting.

Ghostly Visit on a Rainy Night,France,Old Hags / Night Attacks / Sleep Paralysis,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Old Hags / Night Attacks / Sleep Paralysis :: Ghostly Visit on a Rainy Night

I had an interesting experience this summer in France. I was trying to get to sleep alone in a tent on a very stormy night. I was a little jumpy because the rain was coming down in such hard torrents and I wasn't very confident my tent wasn't going to collapse! As I was finally falling asleep, I became convinced there was a man outside my tent -- I had an image of his walking along side it outside. I grew more and more anxiety-ridden.

Suddenly, it was as if there was a man --a soldier-- on top of me. He was holding me down with his entire body, and using a hand to cover my mouth as I struggled from beneath him. He spoke quickly in another language (German? I've only had one semester of it, so I'm hesitant to pinpoint it as such). It was dreamlike in the sense that I couldn't really move or scream, which if this sort of thing really happened I am absolutely positive I would have no trouble doing either.

Then, I woke myself up with my own cries and gasps--and I was there alone in my tent and just fine. I slept there for six weeks with no other incident (I'm an archaeologist, it was our field camp), though someone with a tent nearby mine got up one morning about 2am or so, to urinate and claimed he saw a figure pacing the end of the field we were camped in, along the edge of some woods (actually around where my tent was).

One other girl, with a tent a bit further down from mine, also claimed at one point that she felt some sort of presence--an unpleasant one at that, whom made her uncomfortable--outside her tent. I almost always have unpleasant, often disturbing dreams, but this was by far the most vivid--I didn't realize I had even fallen asleep until I woke up.

I think what I dreamed/experienced may be related to the other two incidents that occurred in camp?

Ghost of a Curious Young Boy,"Oregon, United States",Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: Ghost of a Curious Young Boy

I just want to say I love this site. I love how its not covered with cheesy cartoon ghosts and other silly graphics. I will start with the most recent one that happened to me. It was about 4 in the afternoon and I had just picked my son up at the bus stop. When we got home, I reached back like I always do to undo his safety harness. I opened my door to get out, then I decided to grab the stuff I had sitting in the passenger seat. I could hear my son putting his back pack on behind me. While I was leaning over collecting my stuff with both hands, I thought my son had gotten out of the car before me and had jabbed me really hard in the ribs, the side facing my open door.

I sat up and grabbed my side, still tingling, but was more shocked to see my son was not beside me standing at my door. He was still in the back seat getting his stuff. I looked around for my neighbor (I live in a duplex) to see if he was playing a trick, which is not something he's ever done, but I thought a possibility. He was not around either, I even checked around my vehicle to make sure no one was there.

I had a similar experience before that. I owned a home that was built in 1945 in a small town about 3 1/2 hours from where I am now. The experience was about 3-4 years ago. It was morning and I had just finished taking a shower to get ready for work. The shower made me sleepy so I laid down on my bed, just wrapped in my towel. I dared not put my covers on as I would have totally fallen back asleep. I just wanted to rest for a moment. I was laying on my side with my hands under my head. Not a minute later, I felt my side push in, I felt my skin compress under some pressure. It was gentle, and slow, but left a tingly sensation in the area. Needless to say, I got my clothes on quick and went to work without make-up and such.

In fact, in the house I just mentioned I had several experiences but I will tell only one more. The ones I am telling I can't find a logical non-paranormal explanation for. One's that could be due to electrical problems in the house I will leave out, but very creepy.

Okay, Last one. Same house, again in the morning, but on a weekend. I think around 8 AM. I was wide awake, my husband at the time was at work, he usually worked 6 days a week. I was laying there, enjoying the beautiful morning. I could hear the birds chirping directly out my window, sun shining, blue sky. I could hear the squirrel bouncing across my roof over my room like he did almost every morning. I heard my son pattering through the kitchen and I closed my eyes to do our morning ritual.

He was not yet 4 years old. When he would get to my doorway, he would try to be sneaky, tip toe across the floor, then get really close to the bed and jump on it to see if he could scare me. Well I lay there waiting what felt like 10 minutes and he didn't jump on the bed. I got up and looked around the bed and under the bed to see if he came up with something new. I walked through the kitchen to his room and he was completely asleep! I tapped his side lightly and did some goofy things he can not help but laugh, even when he was pretending to sleep. He was no doubt sound asleep. I was confused. I felt the vibrations and the sound of bare feet on the linoleum. I still can't think of anything else.

For the record, the ghost I think was in that house I believed to be a young boy for various reasons and most things seemed like things a curious kid would do.

Sickly Spirit,Australia,Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: Sickly Spirit

I moved into a house in Trafalgar, Victoria that was over 100 years old, which is old by Australian standards. When I first moved in I was pregnant with my daughter and my sister stayed with me for for a few months while our parents went on a trip around Australia.

I did hear a few weird things while I was in the bathroom. Just noises in the house like someone was walking down the hallway and I didn't think a lot of it. There was a strange feeling in the bathroom too.

One night I got home from work and my sister was stressing because earlier she was in the bathroom and she'd heard me come home and walk through to the kitchen. She came out to see me and realized I wasn't even home yet.

Another night I was having a bath. It was raining outside. It was late at night and my sister was asleep in bed. I heard her get up, walk through the kitchen (the bathroom comes off the kitchen so she walked straight past the bathroom), through the laundry to the toilet and she started throwing up. I thought I better get out of the bath and see if she was ok. I checked the toilet and she wasn't there. I figured she'd already gone back to bed and when I got in there she was asleep. I woke her up and said ""Did you just throw up?"" She was adamant that she had not been out of bed and she looked like she'd just woken up so I don't think she was lying to me about throwing up.

The only thing I could think was that it was someone outside. I even went outside to see if there was vomit in my driveway! I knew it couldn't have been though because it was raining and the noise of the rain on the tin roof was so loud that I wouldn't have heard anyone outside, the noise was also coming from inside the house. It crossed my mind that it could have been the neighbour's in their house but again the noise of the rain would have blocked the sound and I actually used to live in the house next door and I knew the bathroom and toilet were on the other side of that house.

I had a friend come over once and her three year old son started talking to ""the lady in the kitchen"" and when they left he yelled out ""Bye Lady!""

Just after my daughter was born we completely gutted the kitchen, laundry, toilet and bathroom, put in a slate floor and all new fixtures. We put pine lining up on all the walls and painted the roof. It was a renovation that had been planned since we moved in and nothing strange ever happened again.

Sensitive Child,"Florida, United States",Children Who See Spirits,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Children Who See Spirits :: Sensitive Child

W hen she was younger, my little sister used to become terribly frightened for unknown reasons. She would stop playing suddenly and run crying to my mother. At this time I was looking into the supernatural. After researching the incidents, I came to my mother with an explanation. I claimed that my little sister might be sensitive, but was turned down seeing as I was only 13 at the time. My sister ran to my mother in fright more and more often, but when she started school, it stopped. I thought that perhaps the spirit had left.

2 years later, my mother told me that she thought that my sister might be sensitive. After the ""I-told-you-so"", I explained what a sensitive child was to my mother. My mother said that my sister fell asleep in her bed, but woke around 10:30. My sister told my mother that she had a dream that the T.V. turned off by itself and it scared her. Waving it off, my mother got my sister to go back to sleep. But not even 5 minutes later, the T.V. turned off and when my mother turned it back on, the picture was an odd series of black, white, and grey fuzz that was unusual for out T.V. No matter how hard my mother tried, she couldn't get the T.V. working. Every time it was the same odd fuzz.

It wasn't until the next morning that the picture came back. We've unsuccessfully tried to get the same fuzz on for a week and a half, now.

More of my Strange Experiences,"Oklahoma, United States",Poltergeists / Physical Manifestations,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Poltergeists / Physical Manifestations :: More of my Strange Experiences

I have written a few other stories , but I have one that happened the other night, and one that happened a long time ago, when I was about 6. Well here is the story from the other night.

I was sitting in my bed, I couldn't go to sleep... Just laying there, my dad walked by my room, ""You need to go to bed..."" I said ok, and he walked to the living room. I sat in there awake a little while longer. I hear my dad snoring, and I am sure everyone else in the house is asleep. I hear a clang all of a sudden, coming from the kitchen, along with knocks, and all different kinds of stuff. I sit in my bed, frozen from fright. It finally stops, and after a while, I calm down, and loosen my body a bit. I am 13. So I think it might be a poltergeist. That is just my theory.

My mom was still sleeping with me at this age. All of the lights were off. So I sat in bed. Awake. I close my eyes for a minute, then I opened them. I am sure this was not there before, there was a light on my dresser in front of my bed. Not big, just a dot. I asked my mom what it was but she didn't look to see what it was... ""Oh. It is just your guardian angel..."" I just said oh, and finally fell asleep. Was it a ghost, or a guardian angel?

The Ugly and Laughing Clown,"Michigan, United States",Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: The Ugly and Laughing Clown

T his took place in the late 1950's. The basement of my aunt and uncle's house was where they lived until they built a house onto the top of the basement. It was large but had very little lighting in it. Which most of the bulbs to the lighting in the ceiling were taken out. And only three worked, one by the steps, the bathroom and the largest room. The lights were turned on by pull strings.

As children we were too short to be able to pull the string to turn on the light. The basement had many small windows around it, but none of them open. The day time playing in the basement one could see okay, with the many windows around it. At night time was very dark.

My younger sister and I had to spend all our summers, when out of school at my aunts house. My cousin Maxie (not her real name) had a nice size big bedroom. In it was lots of stuffed animals and these ugly clowns. I would often beg her to put them away while my sister and I, was staying in her room to sleep at night. She would tell me I was a cry baby just wanting to go home before I was suppose to. No matter how much I ask my mom ""why we had to be there every summer?"" I never did get an answer to those many questions.

One night shortly after my sister and I were there at my aunts house, my sister woke up and had to go to the bathroom. We had to get up and walk past the shelf, where the clowns were. Down many steps to the dark basement, where the bathroom was. I held onto my sister's hand as we went down the stairs, only a light to show us down the steps. We had to cross over to the other side of the basement, to the bathroom in the dark.

We made it to the bathroom, but while in the bathroom we could hear laughing. My sister is hanging onto my hand really tight. I am trying to be brave. I left the light on in the bathroom, as it showed us to the steps, instead of walking in total darkness. We climbed all the steps and ran back to our cousin's bedroom. On her shelf where the clowns were, one was looking right at us and laughing. We got into bed and covered our heads.

My cousin Maxie woke up and wonder why, the bedroom light was on. ""We told her that ugly clown was looking at us and was laughing"". She got up and went to that ugly clown, took it off the shelf and threw it onto my sister and I. Making us scream so loudly, our aunt came into the room, to see what was the matter. We told her of the laughing, ugly clown.

So our aunt took the clown out of the room, turned off the light. I am looking at that shelf in the semi darkness and I can hear that clown laughing again. I just covered my head up and got close to my sleeping little sister.

Some days went by and nothing happen. Maxie and my sister and I went to the basement to play, one rainy day. I said ""Did you hear that?"". Maxie tells me she heard nothing. I said ""it's that ugly clown again laughing"". She told me I was lying. I asked her what her mom did with the clown? Maxie said she didn't know. She said she has had those clowns, in her room for years and she never seen or heard them laugh.

Awhile later we were outside playing, Maxie, my sister and I. We went to go around the corner of the house, when I stopped abruptly! I came face to face with that clown. My scream was heard across the street. The lady from across the street came over, and so did our aunt from inside the house. Maxie ran into the house. I told my aunt and the lady across the street about the ugly, laughing clown. They made me think I was hearing and seeing things, and all would be fine.

Some time later I was in the basement going to the bathroom, with my little sister. We had the door closed to the bathroom. We could hear Maxie screaming and banging on the door to get in. We let her in and the lights went out. I could hear Maxie scream, my little sister crying for mama and the laughing of the clown. It got nearer and nearer to us. It drowned out the crying and the screaming in the bathroom.

My uncle came into the basement, to see what was going on. He turned on the light by the stairs. His daughter flung herself into, her daddies arms still screaming. Then she said ""I was going to come down here and scare the cry babies"". ""When I got down here near them, I seen the clown off my shelf looking mean and laughing"". Our uncle took us all upstairs to their room. ""See he said the clown is still there"", pointing towards a closet in his bedroom. We all looked and didn't see, any clown in there.

We went to Maxie's room and there sat that ugly, laughing clown. Our uncle ask his wife if she put it back in Maxie's room. She had not. Yet it was there. My aunt took all the clowns off the shelf and burnt them. Told us we have no more problems with them again. My sister and I went home. We told our mom we were not going back to that house again, something was wrong in that house. We never did have to go back again.

I seen Maxie about three years ago at a wedding. I asked ""Do you remember those clowns, you use to have when you were young?"". Her face turned white, she dropped her glass, which held her drink in it onto the floor. She told me ""NEVER to mention about those clowns, or any clown to her again"". I learned from Maxie's sister that Maxie's room was closed up and locked. That Maxie and her shared a bedroom. When they moved from that house, Maxie's stuff that was in the room stayed with the house, still with the lock on the door. I am now in my 50's, and to this day still afraid of clowns.

Displaced Militia Man,"Missouri, United States",Apparitions / Voices / Touches,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Apparitions / Voices / Touches :: Displaced Militia Man

I live in a quiet suburb in a 1-story house. At the time, I was sleeping in the upstairs bedroom. When this happened, I was 9 years old and suffering from insomnia. I would often read or watch TV to try and coax myself to sleep. After making myself somewhat sleepy, I proceeded to lay down to attempt to sleep.

My bed faced my door, which I left open. I couldn't get myself to sleep, so I jolted up to grab a book or the remote when I saw a figure in my doorway. I looked up to see if it was my grandma, who was one of the people I lived with. Instead of being a short, happy older woman, it was a tall, brooding man with an old style musket rifle, dating back to revolutionary war times. The man has a tall, pointed hat and appeared to be in British military attire of the period. He pointed this musket at my head, so I darted under the covers. I came up almost a few seconds after seeing the figure and it had disappeared. I got really scared and went downstairs to sleep in my mother's room.

The spirit has not manifested itself into a full bodied apparition since then, but eerie feelings in that room and area of the house still occur.

Even to this day, I'm baffled about why a Revolutionary War period ghost haunted my house. I live in an area that wasn't fought in during that war, and wasn't inhabited until the Louisiana Purchase. I'm attempting to research the spirit, but with little success. If anyone would like to assist me in the research, I would be glad.

My Grandmother's Phone,"Ohio, United States",Misc,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Misc :: My Grandmother's Phone

A s most of you know when a relative dies and they have no will, their possessions are divided equally amongst the family. My grandmother had passed of cancer when I was two years old. I don't remember much of the time we spent together, but from what I've heard she had a short and very troubled life. Which leads me to my conclusion today.

My grandmother was succeeded by 9 children, including my mother. Her assets were sorted through and given away. My mother receded at first from accepting anything. I think it was still to much strain for her, what with caring for during her illness. So not many things were accepted on her behalf.

A few years had passed and I was nearly six years old. My aunt was sorting through the assets she accumulated and was asking my mother if she would like to have them. She finally gave in and accepted those things. My sisters and I were extatic. When the things arrived we all rummaged through them and my mother let us each keep one thing for ourselves. Being young one thing particularly caught my eye. It was an old light blue telephone that I remembered playing with often. I was extremely excited. I took the phone to my room and played with it all day long. The rest of the evening proceeded as normal, dinner, bath time, and bed time shortly after.

I still shared a room with one of my sisters then. We jumped in our bunk beds and began to relax. The phone still sat on my play stand with some other toys. I had finally fallen to sleep when a loud bleating noise pierced my ears. I woke with a start to see where it was coming from. My sister also heard the noise and was already on her feet. She didn't seem that worried when she began to look for the source of the noise, still partially asleep.

She crossed the room and picked up my play phone that was ringing! Mind you this phone had no chord and we didn't have a phone jack in our room. She answered the phone calmly. I guess it didn't register in her mind that the phone was a fake. She picked up the receiver and said hello. I didn't hear the initial phrase but she immediately started to scream for my mother. She dropped the phone to the floor and grabbed me off the top bunk and held me as tight as she could. I finally understood why. The voice on the phone kept speaking. The voice on the other end was my grandmother's, but it wasn't her demeanor. The voice was ill tempered and seemed violent. All it kept repeating was ""hello girls"" *laugh* ""I'm here girls"" *laughing menacingly...*

It kept up the laughing even after my mother bolted through the door. She took one look at the situation and immediately hung up the phone. She tried her best to calm us. By this time every one was in the room asking what happened. All we could say was grandma's here. To which my mother replied that was not your grandma!

Needless to say the next day my toy was destroyed. I'm not sure to this day if it was her or not, but I do believe that my grandma is suffering somewhere due to the horrible events in her life and leading up to her death. Many more events occurred after this but, those are not my stories to tell. I just pray she finds relief somehow. Rest in peace Anna Mae Jackson

Lady in Chains,"Rhode Island, United States",A Haunted Life,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: A Haunted Life :: Lady in Chains

M y name is Jadea, I live in Providence RI and I've had paranormal encounters for a couple of years now. I was around the age of 10 when a young woman started visiting me a few times a week. The girl was beautiful but looked so creepy. She had long dark knee-length hair and wore a long white gown with a chain or two around her neck. I never knew how to react but I know one thing for sure... It scared the living hell outta me.

The first time I ever saw her was in the basement of my old house. I was downstairs washing clothes for church the next day and I felt as though I was being watched so I turned around with my back against the washer and saw the woman standing in the corner of the basement. I just froze I was in shock yet angry at the same time. She stood there with her hands to her sides and her head back and tilted. I stood there for a few seconds and ran upstairs. I was the only one home so I ended up going to my neighbors house next door.

As the weeks went by I become so miserable and paranoid. I ended up seeing the woman at school (was in 5th grade at the time) I was in gym class and me and a few of my friends were sitting against a wall chatting away. I turned my head away for a second and saw the women sitting on the stage step (gym was huge and mini 1-step stage at the end of the gym). The woman stared at me and was walking back and forth with her hands behind her back. Another time I saw the woman I was at my fathers house in Fallriver Mass. My father was asleep and I sat in he hall playing with my fathers rottweiler named Tread, I looked up and right at the end of the hall where the kitchen leads I see the woman standing there staring at me, I noticed that whenever I saw her, her hair was either straighten or in ringlets and sometimes the gown she wore had polka dots on it and always had the chain around her neck and waist as if it were a belt.

The woman never harmed me but always had me paralyzed with fear. The most action ever seeing that woman was on the same day, Tread (my dads dog) lifted his head from my lap and growled looking at the exact same direction that the ghostly woman in chains was.

Well this is my first post on here, I have many other true stories to tell but I promise not to make them as long and boring as this one...

I Saw my Grandmother's Shadow,Mexico,Family / Friends Visits,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Family / Friends Visits :: I Saw my Grandmother's Shadow

W hen I was a little girl, me and my family would always travel to Mexico for Christmas and New Years. It would be me, my mom, my sister, my aunts and uncles, and a few cousins. We would travel by bus or by car and drive to Mexico. We would stay with my aunt and grandfather at their house.

While we were there, me and my sister and cousins would stay up late, wandering the house. It wasn't big but it was a two floor house. Well, one night, we were wandering around and were sitting in the living room near the front door. We were sitting there and my cousin suddenly said, ""Did you know that our grandmother died in this house?""

We were all started talking about this topic, about our grandmother and how our parents remembered everything about her. As we were talking, we heard clashing in the kitchen. It sounded like someone clanking plates and glasses together. We looked at the kitchen and it was dark.

We started telling one another to go check it out. I ended up looking and I was only about 8 or 9 back then. Well, I went to the kitchen and looked inside. I stayed there staring at what I saw.

It was a tall slender shadow holding one of the plates in it's hands and a towel in the other. I couldn't scream, or, talk, or even move. This shadow kept washing the dishes, and I couldn't move or do anything.

It was about 5 minutes later that my cousin said, ""Adrienne, you okay over there?"" The shadow turned and saw me. The only I saw was the shadow turning and then fading, letting the dish and towel fall to the floor.

When the dish shattered I yelped and my cousins all ran to the kitchen. Since then, they don't believe me when I say that I actually saw our grandmother's shadow. They only laugh at me.

Ever since that experience, I've been trying to learn more about spirits and paranormal happenings. I hope I learn enough and have another encounter with my grandmother again.

The Tooth Fairy,"Alabama, United States",Orbs / Lights / Mists,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Orbs / Lights / Mists :: The Tooth Fairy

O ne night, when I was around six or seven years old, I lost my second tooth. I was very excited about the Tooth Fairy and placed my tooth under my pillow, knowing that when I awoke in the morning there would be a dollar bill waiting for me instead.

Like most small children, I was excited and was wide awake in my bed. I was never afraid of the dark and my light was out, the door open ajar at my mother's insistence. In those days, I kept my old high bed pushed against the wall, next to the window, and I would hold the blinds out of the way and sit on my bed and stare out into the front yard when I couldn't sleep. Our house was the last on the left at a dead end. There were no streetlights and our yard was over an acre, the house set rather far from the street. My window faced the street, and there was a large Azalea bush several feet in front of it.

Well on that night, I couldn't sleep because I was so excited about the Tooth Fairy coming. There was a full moon and the yard was bright enough to see if anyone was walking around. As I was gazing out the window I saw a bright orb of greenish yellow light coming towards my window from the street. The ball of light grew as it traveled down my yard towards my window, then it turned around the Azalea bush and floated out of sight around the side of the house.

This could not have been a flash light or anyone in my yard, as I would have seen them. The ball of light was about the size of an adults fist and it floated around five feet from the ground. When I saw the light I dived under my blankets and pretended to be asleep because I believed that I had just seen the Tooth Fairy, and I was afraid that she would know that I had seen her and would not come take my tooth. I felt no fear at all, just excitement and a bit of guilt, like I had seen something I should not have. At some point I fell asleep.

I never really thought about it for years. I told no one because at that age I honestly believed in things like the Tooth Fairy and the Easter Bunny, and I didn't think that I had seen anything mysterious or strange. But now when I think back, the memory is still very clear, I honestly can't figure out what it was that I really saw.

So Many Weird Things Happened in that House,"North Carolina, United States",Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: So Many Weird Things Happened in that House

S ince I am new to this site, and have never published a story here before, I figured I would start with my very first ghost encounters, some are as related to me by my mother. When I was about three or four years old, we lived in Washington, PA. I suddenly came up with a friend named Jodi. My mom just figured it was an imaginary friend and never thought much of it until one day.

It was Veteran's Day and she sat reading a commemorative paper remembering soldiers all the way back to the Civil War, when suddenly I came up and pointed to a gentleman and said, ""That's Jodi!"" Sure enough, the soldier's last name was Jodi. I think he was a Lieutenant in the Civil War. Regardless he followed me to the next house we lived in, and I do remember feeling very safe with him. And furthermore I hadn't learned to read yet, so there's no way I could've known except that he was my special friend.

The second encounter, which I slightly remember, happened in Hickory PA. My mother, grandmother and I were peeling apples in the living room. Suddenly my mom jumps up yelling for my sister to get back in bed. We all saw the shadow of a small child on the wall. When my mom reached the top of the steps and entered the room, my then toddler sis' was still sound asleep in her crib! As Mom made her way back down the stairs, the shadow appeared again! Mom chased it back up the stairs. After five minutes or so of this chase, my mom finally said ""It's your nap time too! Go back to bed!"" At this the madness stopped and the shadow retreated.

Other strange things would occur in this house, such as my mother and I both having terrible nightmares about fires. It was known that the driveway used to be a road, and a little down the way was where the original house had stood centuries before, until a fire broke out killing most of the family. It was said that they reused a lot of the bricks and wood to reconstruct the house we lived in.

Also there were shelves in our playroom that stood high on the wall, that even my tall father would have to get a step ladder to reach. We would often go into the room to find the old, decorative toys off the shelves and strewn about the floor.

There was electrical phenomenon too! I can remember my father yelling at me for messing around with his stereo equipment in his studio in the basement, and my mom stopping him because we hadn't been home that day. There were even times I can remember my mom fighting with the TV to stay turned off.

So many weird things happened in that house I could list them all day, so I will leave this story at that. Hope you all enjoyed!

Tales From  The Homeplace 2,"Tennessee, United States",Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: Tales From  The Homeplace 2

W e won't dwell on the dining room except to say that, at times ""It"" aggravated people who slept in there, especially if they were overnight guests. There were other minor things that happened over the years, such as hearing a baby cry when there were no babies around. At night you could hear someone ascend the staircase, walk across the upstairs floor and sit down on a bed. When you turned on the light there would be no one there. This happened many times and each time it happened it would scare the fire out of us.

In the summertime you could hear children laughing and playing, when there were no children present or all the children were accounted for. These things I have experienced my own self.

In 1963 or 64 we tore the kitchen, dining room and back porch down and replaced them with a new kitchen, dining room and two bedrooms and a bathroom. An attic type upstairs sit on top the dining and bedrooms. The bedrooms were put where the old dining room was. One on each end with the bath in the middle. The dining room now is where the kitchen used to be and a new kitchen was added to the side. The new upstairs was divided into two bedrooms. The new upstairs was now the girl side and the old upstairs was the boys side. Now that I've got everyone thoroughly confused, I'll continue with the story.

Moving along in time to 1967 or 68 and I'm between thirteen and fourteen years old. I'm sitting in an old armchair we have on the front porch enjoying the sunshine. I'm looking off towards the woodland, not thinking about anything really when I noticed the the air was crackling and my skin felt like low voltage electricity was flowing through me. I shifted my weight and started working my shoulders, hands and fingers trying to get the tingling to stop.

I then heard the sounds of drums and chanting. I look back toward the woodland, which was like a hundred yards away, and saw a black mass coming toward me. As it got closer the drums and chanting got louder. I could now see that the mass looked like five monks side by side, with the tallest one in the center. They seemed to glide on the air in a straight line. As they got closer, the drums and chanting reached an almost deafening level. My eyes were glued to them and I couldn't look away. The closer they got the louder they became and I became terrified but I was literally frozen in fear. My inner voice was telling me to run or die but I couldn't bring myself to move.

When they got within 15 to 20 feet of me, I found myself on my feet with Momma shaking the fool out of me. In a few minutes everything was back to normal. In the few minutes it took, I could see the figures retreating backwards to the woods.

Momma took me in the house to ""tend to"" me. When I had fully regained my composure she told me, that when she came on the porch I was sitting on the edge of the chair shaking like a leaf. She said I was sweating profusely, with a terrified look on my face. When she grabbed me, I was cold to the touch.

I still don't know what to make of this. Why did I see Monks in Tennessee? Why did I feel like I was close to dying? What would have happened if Momma hadn't of come to my rescue?

Haunted House or Just Bad Feng Shui?,"Oregon, United States",Misc,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Misc :: Haunted House or Just Bad Feng Shui?

I swear my house has the worst energy. I am building a feng Shui garden right now. Day by day. I have exposed my mind to just about everything religion has to offer and I fear nothing in religion. Today I ripped up the moss out of the grass after poisoning it a week ago. I planted Tulips. And grass seed. I am fighting against this odd energy that still sleeps with my family.

My house: We felt so happy to move into this house with such low rent but we quickly discovered odd things. The house had cameras on the front and back, rose bushes everywhere around the house with no blossoms, crappy yard but the inside has been nice. Found bones in the back yard, I assume they are cow bones. Our landlord said we cannot have dogs ever! My girlfriend and I have had this shared feeling from day one. I tried to remove it so I inspected the house.

I found a chain on the side of our bedroom window which I removed, I put the screen back on our window which had duck-tape residue on it. We had odd howling sounds under our bedroom which claimed to be from the wind outside from the ventilation under the house. I checked this and it seems that all vents are boxed off around the bedroom except one. Hence the odd sound I assume. We keep hearing sounds, so I bought a fountain to drown out the odd sounds.

Last night my girlfriend who is not a sleep walker, woke me up telling me this ""get out, leave this place, you are not welcomed here, get out now..."" and then babbled about death... I said, what? I talked to her but she didn't respond. This was the first time that she has ever said anything that creeped me out since dating her 2 1/2 years ago. So, I nugged her with my arm to make sure she was awake and questioned her about what she was saying. I still haven't told her what she told me because she will freak out if she knows what she said to me. She said that she thought she was dead and her children had left her and she feared for her children's life. I reminded her that this is not true and that she was dreaming.

Tonight my girlfriend is concerned that she will sleep walk just like her oldest daughter already does. I think this house just has bad energy but I will heal it with time by removing all the fears. Another part of me keeps feeling the creepy feeling that this is something much more. Such as the doors shutting themselves after about one minute if the doors are ajar. In fact, I think I could time it and have all things in the house turned off it is so consistent. I am logical but I must say this is odd.

I was a sleep walker also but that was due to a dramatic event that happened to me, and it was all logical. I am not looking for ghosts, just logic. I was 5 years old when I sleep walked. I am fine now. I think my house just has bad energy but my gut keep saying otherwise.

Well our cats are happy, (they are stray until moving in with us in this house) so I am sure we just need to work on the yard to make this shared feeling go away. Hell, we had a bad start and we are probably just freaked out. Who wouldn't be. Thanks for reading my story. Living with this creepy feeling while taking a shower or trying to sleep keeps a person up all night. I keep ignoring it until my lady starts freaking me out during REM.

The Laptop and the New Discman,Canada,Apparitions / Voices / Touches,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Apparitions / Voices / Touches :: The Laptop and the New Discman

O ne night I could not get to sleep so I popped open my dad's laptop. This has happened quite a bit of times but not a lot. I would not touch anything, but a face would flicker on the screen. It was a male probably about 19, he had short hair and sometimes you could see a red plaid shirt.

Now he was not even native, so I doubt it is a reservation haunting. When he shows there is no light and I would never have pressed the power button either. But I have never gotten creeped out by this man. No conversations with him, like I have had with the little girl, but no bad vibes like the ghost car on my street.

Recently I got a discman. Some of you may wonder why I got it instead of an iPod or an MP3. I would rather have the discman, I just like it more. Me and my brother were waiting to go inside a theatre to see U2-3D and my mom and her boyfriend went to research the parking meter. I was almost finished listening to the first song on my favourite CD, The Sufferer and the Witness. All of a sudden it went all staticy. In the left ear I heard nothing but static, but in the right ear I heard a scratchy voice saying ""GEEEET OOOOUUT"". This theatre is pretty new and as far as I know not built on or near anything old.

So I ask you all to help me figure out what this voice was and what it is trying to tell me.

My Pet Feels a Presence,Greece,Misc,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Misc :: My Pet Feels a Presence

I had just finished eating dinner. This happened 2 days ago. I was petting my rabbit and suddenly he froze. His ears went cold (when he's scared that happens to him) and he just stood in a place for more than a minute. I tried petting him and settling him down, but nothing would seem to comfort him. There was a breeze, a cold one, and the curtains to the kitchen window blew a little bit apart. Now, no window was open, and there is no crack in any of them because the are insulated. My rabbit at this point had huddled to the corner of his cage.

I was really concerned because if rabbits are shocked badly enough, it can induce a very violent heart attack. I took his cage and put it in the living room, where there was a fire going in the fire place. I sat down to read. He seemed to settle a bit since he was near me. I pet him and calmed him and spoke gently.

When I took him out for a run, he wouldn't leave my lap. Every time I put him down from the couch, he'd jump up again and stay beside my legs or curl up on my chest. Eventually, he lay down in my lap and I stroked him.

This has happened more than once, and I was very concerned because rabbits are really sensitive. I'm a very verbal person, and I'm quick to react to threats to my animals. I said (if I may say so, really angrily)

""I don't know what the hell is your business in my house, but leave my pet alone, got it? I don't want him to be scared because of you!""

I stroked my rabbit and put him down in another attempt. And you know what? He ran around as if he had never been scared. I don't think whatever it is wants to hurt me, but it seems to enjoy scaring my pants off.

Too Close for Comfort,Greece,Apparitions / Voices / Touches,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Apparitions / Voices / Touches :: Too Close for Comfort

I had gotten up for a glass of water. I went back to the couch. The living room has a fireplace, and we keep it lit almost all day. Naturally, the room is warm. It didn't seem like that at the moment.

There was a chill through the room, and then I felt like someone had their fingers on my neck. I felt the hairs on my nape rise up, like someone had been tickling me there. There was a small shiver down my spine. Then, just to make me travel to the brink of terror, there was a short constriction on my throat, but REALLY powerful. I choked and I was coughing for more than a minute. I tried to ignore it, but it's almost like someone's taunting me. I heard footsteps, and that's when I decided to bring my rabbit into the living room. Whatever it was, I don't want my pet to be alone. As you can see, I turn to him (rabbit) for comfort in many of my stories.

I surfed the net on my laptop, and then I felt someone grasp my feet really lightly. Then it was at my upper arm, then on my neck again. There was no one there. I might as well have screamed and laughed at the same moment. I'm extremely ticklish. For several more minutes, I felt like someone was passing over a really light cloth of some kind over my bare skin.

These little brushes really creep me out. What do you think it is? And if you do know what it is, how can I get rid of it?

Dreams that Grab my Conciousness,Greece,Psychic / Medium,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Psychic / Medium :: Dreams that Grab my Conciousness

I n my other stories, I have mentioned that the apartment I used to live in (I think), was haunted. Well, this is another of my experiences. Rather a small paragraph explaining them. At one instance, I was washing my face at the sink, it was about 6:00 PM. I heard a tapping at the window, and as I was wiping myself with a towel, I turned.

I saw a white face pressed into the window, along with hands. It was ghastly. We were are the fourth floor and there was no balcony that way. No one could possibly be there. The face vanished. Despite my fright, I opened the window and looked around. When I turned my head to the right, I saw something black disappear around the corner of the building. By this time, I was freaked, out. That night I rolled my shutters down completely, locked all the doors and slept with the lights on.

The other time, I was in bed. I had a nightmare about owls attacking my window and I was watching them press their beaks against the glass. I love animals, and I loved them then, but for some reason I was scared to death. They broke through the window and the glass fell on me. The owls were white. They started pecking me, and I hurt so much I opened my eyes. I knew it was a nightmare, but I had bolted upright to a sitting position. There on my feet, was sitting a white owl. Of course, I screamed bloody murder and my mother came running. Apparently she couldn't see anything. She sat down straight on the owl. The owl passed right through her. Next time I blinked, it was gone.

I was in bed this time, too. I was staring up at the ceiling, because I couldn't go to sleep. I saw movement on my ceiling and I sat up. I didn't see anything else, so I lay down again. I heard a rasping sound (I slept on a wooden bunkbed that had closets underneath it, instead of being double) on the wood, and I looked over the side. It was a big snake, beige and with orange spots. It slithered onto my bed and coiled around my neck and arms. It started to constrict. I screamed the house down (yet again, I was only about ten or eleven) and in a blink, the snake was gone. Later on at night, it appeared again, only this time with another green python. The next day, I looked them up. Both were a species of snakes.

Does anyone care to explain? This happens all the time. I see things. For instance, I was in my summer house and my parents room was next to me. I was trying to go to sleep. I got up for a glass of water. When I sat back down, I saw a man in a blue suit with red hair, hands outstretched towards my parents' bed. He was very tall, and strongly built, a bit chubby. His hair was spiky and he was wearing a white starched shirt, a blue tie and a blue suit and blue trousers. I yelled out to my parents. They woke up immediately. The man looked up at me, shrugged and disappeared. I was thoroughly shaken.

I am not crazy. I am very sane. And even if my family doesn't believe me, I swear I saw these things. Can anyone help?!

The Gentle Lady,Greece,Apparitions / Voices / Touches,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Apparitions / Voices / Touches :: The Gentle Lady

T his is taking place in my old apartment, my room. I have moved twice since. I was sitting on my bed, reading a book. I looked up to see the time and I rubbed my eyes and lay back for a while. I felt something cool on my cheek. I opened my eyes and it was a lady in a white nightgown. She had light auburn hair and blue eyes, and her skin was pale and icy cold. I backed away, scared out of my pants, nearly falling off the bed.

Only then did I notice that the lady wasn't on the floor (I slept on a high bunkbed, and instead of another bed underneath, it had drawers and a closet). At this point, I opened my mouth and took a deep breath for a blood-curdling scream. She put her hand on her lips in a ""Shush,"" gesture.

She looked so gentle that I obeyed. Instead, I stared like a dope and studied her. She was barefoot, too, about in her teens. I looked up at her face again. She smiled at me, very sweetly and faded away.

My jaw might have dropped to the floor. I don't know. But it did go a long, long way. I told my family. No one believed me. Everyone told me it was because I was being influenced my the stories I read. I was never a big fan of ghost stories - until I had experiences that were ghost stories. Only then did I look up ghosts and the whole subject of the paranormal.

Meeting the Deceased at the Wake,"Iowa, United States",Family / Friends Visits,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Family / Friends Visits :: Meeting the Deceased at the Wake

M y dad had 7 sisters and 5 brothers, making 13 siblings in his family. As they grew up things were pretty rocky, financially. Some married pretty young and began their own families, moved to other parts of the United States and began their own lives. Having said this, needless to say I have many, many cousins and a large extended family.

As I grew, I would spend time with a few family members here and there, just depended on what was going on at the time. With a family this size, you become accustomed to numerous family gatherings and obligations cropping up repeatedly and at short notice.

One Thursday afternoon, we received a call from my Aunt Jamie. This call was one of the calls you dread ever receiving. My uncle had passed away. He was unfortunately hit by a city bus. He had gotten off work at a local factory and stopped off for a few drinks with his buddies. Instead of driving home after his 2 beers, he decided it best to walk home. He stepped in front of the bus as the bus left one of its stops. The vehicle was not going very fast, but the impact was enough to knock him off of his feet, he hit his head on the raised curd of the side walk. The head injury caused bleeding, he never woke up.

The final arrangements had been made to afford the family and friends services to pay their respects. Both my mother and father had to work and were not able to go to the services as it would be 2 or 3 days away. It was decided that I would accompany one of my aunts to the services to pay respects for our branch of the family. We would be staying 2 nights and 3 days in Sioux City, IA to attend all of the functions.

Although I was only 15 years old at the time, I had been to several funerals prior to this, unfortunately. Again, this is what sometimes happens with a large family. I was not frightened or nervous about the services; at this point I had come to accept these rituals as part of life. I was, however, not happy about having to be gone from home for an extended time. When you are 15, 3 days can seem like a life time!

As we drove the 2 1/2 hours to Sioux City, much of the conversation revolved around my Uncle Danny. I had not seen him since I was 8 years old. He had gone off the so called beaten path. He did not choose to go to church, to be involved with a lot of the family after he moved to Iowa, so he was not always around. My aunt I was traveling with mentioned that he had gotten involved in an cult. She was not sure which one, how or their beliefs, but for a somewhat rural type family anything out of the norm such as a cult was just ghastly!

We arrived at a huge rambling older home. There were 6 bedrooms, 3 bathrooms and many, many other rooms including a concrete basement that spanned half of the house below ground. As we arrived, many other family members were already there milling around. I was kind of surprised that for a single man, my uncle had lived in such a large house. My aunt that I came with explained that someone had left the home to him in their will, my uncle fell in love with it and kept it. He apparently only lived in about half of the house, keeping the other rooms closed off.

I was assigned to a bedroom on the top floor of the three story home for my stay, right near my aunt I had come with. We climbed the stairs to the bedrooms to freshen up before the wake.

While climbing the stairs with my aunt behind me, my leading the way I kept getting the shivers. I thought maybe the air conditioning was turned up, it was August and a humid and sweltering 89 degrees out doors. I told my aunt as we climbed that I was cold. She said I was just tired. I mentioned the air condition and was informed that the house did not have air conditioning as it was too old and my uncle really didn't see the need for such frivolous comforts.

We reached the top landing and I was directed to got 2 doors down on the right and I would be staying there, apparently other family members had been up to clean and air the rooms and halls because the place was immaculate and spelled faintly or lavender. My aunt indicated that there was a restroom directly across from where I would be sleeping. All of the doors on this floor were closed. I found that odd, but thought maybe family was occupying these rooms and had the doors closed to get ready for the services.

I picked up a bag in each hand and started down the hallway. My aunt informed she had forgotten something in the car and would be right back; she ascended the stairs leaving her two bags lying at the top of the stairs near the landing.

I was road weary and couldn't wait for a shower and a change of clothes. I looked up and there were 3 white shadows hovering in the middle of the hallway. 1 of the shadows had a human shape to it, the other 2 just a dense white fog. I blinked a couple of times, and then heard what sounded like wind chimes and they were gone. Poof! Gone!

I ran down the hall and entered my assigned room, closed the door and locked it. What the heck! My heart was beating so loudly I couldn't stand it. I sat down on the bed and tried to find logic in what I had just witnessed.

There was a soft knock on the door, thinking it was my aunt, I jumped up, turned the lock and opened the door. There was a man standing there smiling at me. He stated he had seen me run into the bed room and wanted to make sure I was okay. I asked who he was. He smiled very wide and warmly and stated that he was a related to my dad and he knew just who I was. We entered the bed room, leaving the door open and sat in chairs facing each other, and visited. He was very easy to talk to. He told me stories about my dad and my aunts and uncles as they grew up. I was very relaxed.

About an hour later my aunt was calling to me from the hallway, I stuck my head out the door to acknowledge her. She stated it was time to go to the funeral home for the services. I told her we would be right out. I turned back around and there was no one in the room! He was gone.

I ran out of the room, telling my aunt about my visitor, that he said he was related. When she asked how he was related, I realized I did not know, I had not asked. My aunt stated that the ride and the heat must have gotten to me because there was only one door out of the room and I had been in that door way, there was no where for a person to go in the room. I grabbed my purse and we headed down the stairs.

As we reached the landing to the second, a framed photo to the left reflected the sun and caught my attention. I stepped off the landing into the hallway and walked over to the picture. It was a photograph of the man I had been visiting with! I asked my aunt who the man was. She told me it was the uncle whose wake service we were going to be late for if I did not hurry up. She said they kept the photo there on the wall because the second floor was his favorite. I explained that was the man I had been talking to! She stood there and stared at me for a few seconds the chastised me for trying to upset her by telling a fib like that. I just remained quiet. I was dumbfounded.

I continued through the next couple days services kind of in a fog. Before we were to leave for our trip home, we had tea with some of my other relatives. They were discussing the sale of the house. One of my uncles who were involved in the conversation stated we would not be able to sell until all of that nonsense on the second floor was gone and burned. Well, now I HAD to know what was on the second floor.

I kind of slinked away from the gathering and went up to the second floor. I stopped at the photo, staring at it for just a moment, then (I am not sure if this was a trick of my eyes or not) the photo winked at me.

I moved down the hallway and opened the first door on the right. It was painted bright red with a single kneeler with a red cloth draped over the top in the middle of the room. The windows were completely covered with tin foil so no sun light was visible. I shut off the light, suppressed a shiver and closed the door.

I opened the next room's door; it was painted black with a single kneeler with a black cloth draped over it. Windows covered the same way as in the other room. I shut off the light and closed that door.

As I neared the third door, I could hear a murmur of voices behind the door. I thought well there is other family up here; I am not by myself going through this mysterious house alone. I opened the door and the room was pitch black, there were no lights on. The murmur of voices was still there, very low in the room. I reached over and flipped on the light. The room was again painted black, but there were 3 rows of chairs in the room, each with a black cloth draped over it. There were no pictures or a pulpit or anything, just the chairs. All of the sudden, the murmur of voices got more intense, like being inside a bee hive. I closed the door, forgetting to turn off the light. I ran down the stairs and asked my aunt if we could leave, now! She asked what was wrong. I told her nothing, I just wanted to go home.

We drove for quite some time in complete silence. My aunt then told me in a very no nonsense voice that I should not have went on to the second floor of the house, that it was bad manners to poke around without permission.

We have never spoken of that visit to Sioux City since then and rarely is my uncle mentioned.

What does all this mean? I have no idea, but... It was terrifying and has stuck with me over all these years.

A Candle in the Snow,Greece,Family / Friends Visits,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Family / Friends Visits :: A Candle in the Snow

M any have come to call it ""follie""; I have always thought it as being the ""yearning"" of a ""young heart"" to dwell into the mysteries of love and seek for a sense of completion and, with that being the moving force, I set off to marry my good friend at the age of 19. It didn't last long! I still recall my grandfather's words when I ""admitted my defeat"" for the 1st time.

""Love is not to, simply, look at each other's eyes but when two sets of eyes look towards the same direction in life...""

It was at that moment when everything fell into place and I found the strength to pack my few belongings and declare ""I'm moving out!"" -a decision soon postponed due to an unfortunate event. That same day we learnt that my father-in-law was dying of lung cancer... It was high time I set my priorities aside.

I loved that man whom his family feared and disliked for his bad temper. To me, he was an angry little boy who, desperately seeking for attention, would, at times, cross the line! I observed him after each fight to see that he would retreat, only to hate himself for the pain he had caused.

He loved me too for seeing through him and forgiving his violent outbursts. His whole face would go red every time I hugged and kissed him only to prove how unfamiliar he was with physical contact.

During his last days, he would shift moods even more often. One day he'd be hopeful and calm, another, angry and bitter. I stayed with him, listened to him, encouraged him and then, cried with him.

Things soon took a turn for the worse preventing him from eating or even breathing until the end came to ease his pain and bring relief to the hearts of others.

It must have been a few weeks after his funeral when I woke up from a disturbing dream. I couldn't get his voice out of my mind.

""Why bother? He's dead,"" but after my persistence, she switched into ""customs dictate...""

Ten minutes later, I was on my way to his final resting place and battling with the early morning frost. I didn't know whether I could find his grave (having been there only once since the funeral) and since it was half an hour to sun rise I began questioning my decision.

As I entered the front gate I stopped to gaze at the most beautiful landscape that lay silent under a thick blanket of snow. And yet, it didn't look distant but rather inviting, not empty, simply awaiting stoically for those who have not yet forgotten.

I looked around in anxiety uncertain of what to do. I remembered that his grave was near the gate but where?! And then, in a single moment I caught the glimpse of a fainting light coming, as if, from under the snow.

I approached with hesitation and found myself in front of his headstone. I, then, bent over to the direction of the light to see a candle which, having burnt below the surface of the snow, had formed a small tunnel around it protecting its flame from the gentle wind.

I placed a small bowl of wheat next to the grave, lit a new candle and whispered a prayer wondering how strangely beautiful the world is.

Ghost at the Olympic Star Restaurant,"Illinois, United States",Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: Ghost at the Olympic Star Restaurant

W hen I was about six or seven years old, I went out to breakfast with my dad at a restaurant called 'Olympic Star'. I know it is either in or near Tinley Park, so maybe you have heard of it. I excused myself from the table to use the bathroom. I opened the squeaky door and went into the bathroom, and since there were only three stalls and all the doors were open, I knew no one was in the bathroom except for me.

I walked into one of the stalls and turned around and locked the door, and as soon as I did that, the door started to violently shake back and forth by itself, as if someone was trying to get in from the other side. I looked through the crack in the door, and all I saw was a transparent red color about 5 feet high, about where someone's shirt would have been, but I could see right through it!

Then, after the door stopped shaking, I heard a loud, prolonged sigh, as if someone was frustrated that they couldn't open the stall door. Suddenly, everything just stopped as if someone flipped a switch. No one had opened or closed the door leading into the bathroom the entire time I was in there, and if they did, I would have heard it. Plus, I would have been able to see the person's feet from the opening at the bottom of the stall door, but there weren't any feet to be seen! I immediately searched the bathroom to see if anybody really was in there, but there was no one. I find it very odd that a possible entity was angry because it couldn't open a door, when it could probably just walk right through it.

To this day, many years later, I still don't have a clue what happened in that bathroom, but something happened that I will never be able to explain.

Little Boy on the Stairs,"New York, United States",Ghost Hunting,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Ghost Hunting :: Little Boy on the Stairs

W e have started journaling the paranormal activity in our house. As far as we know, the previous owners had never talked about any paranormal activity. We didn't know them personally, but a co-worker was a good friend of theirs and had been to this house frequently. She said the previous owners never mentioned any paranormal activity to her. However, the next time she sees them, she is going to pointedly ask if they had any experiences. It has given me cause to start researching what previously stood on the site of the present house.

This is actually my husband's story, but he gave me permission to post it here.

On Saturday afternoon, I left the house with my two teen daughters and their friends to visit one of our local museums. (Yes, I have teens who actually enjoy museums... especially if they are haunted!) We left my husband Carl at home by himself except for our 9-year-old dog Meisha, a sheltie/terrier mix. Carl was in the kitchen next to the stairs that lead down to the basement. This is also Meisha's favorite hang out, so she was there, teasing for a belly rub.

Carl happened to glance down the steps and saw a little boy looking up at him. The boy was about 3 to 4 years old. He had blond hair and was wearing a blue shirt, black pants and suspenders. This little boy was smiling at Carl... And waving to him. Carl was very surprised. He had seen a white lady apparition in our upstairs hallway before, as well as white girl apparitions in the Rolling Hills Paranormal Research Center , the haunted asylum located in East Bethany, NY (open for public ghost hunts), but this was the first time he had seen a color apparition.

Carl quickly ran into the office to grab my camera to take pix, but the boy was gone when he returned. He then ran to our bedroom to grab his CellSensor EMF detector and took it down the stairs to the spot where he had seen the boy. The needle went off the gauge in this area and the alarm went off. When he received the EMF detector from his loving wife for Christmas, he had taken it around the whole house to see what kind of readings he got in different areas. In that landing at the bottom of the stairs, the needle had barely moved.

Besides seeing the little boy apparition, he also saw a shadow person about halfway across the family room in the basement, rising up from behind the love seat that sits perpendicular to the stairs door. The shadow person was also gone when he returned with the meter.

He immediately called my 13-year-old daughter (our ""ghost magnet"") on her cell phone to ask her to describe the little boy she had seen on the same set of stairs a different day, peaking up at her in the living room. The descriptions matched! Now we have to find out who the little boy is and why he is in our house.

The Shadow Figure at 2:48am,Canada,Apparitions / Voices / Touches,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Apparitions / Voices / Touches :: The Shadow Figure at 2:48am

T his took place in a Hotel in Ontario. I was in my room with my 3 friends watching t.v., then the lights went out. We thought it was everywhere in the hotel. But actually it was only our room. So we thought nothing of it and thought we should go to sleep and so we did.

I'm a very light sleeper and I woke up at 2:48, and went to the bathroom and than got a drink. I was walking back to my bed when out of the corner of my eye I seen someone or something standing in the corner where the bathroom door and the wall meet. I looked again and than it vanished and I thought I was just sleepy. The next morning I went to the manager and told that someone was in my room and he said that no one could have entered without the security key. I was really stunned.

Later that night I went to sleep at 9:00. I was scared that the shadow figure would show up. I fell asleep and than I woke up at 2:48.. .again. I was very scared and when I looked up I seen the figure, but this time it was at the foot of my bed. I was truly frightened. I stayed awake for the next couple of hours. Than I fell asleep. Nothing happened again...

What was happening? It only showed during the hour and always at that one corner except for the last night. Am I crazy or something?

Bathroom Attack,"Oregon, United States",Misc,"I was home alone one day in the bathroom, doing, well you know, girl things, hair, make-up etc. I started to get this weird feeling like I wasn't alone in my house. Usually I see glimpse of things moving around every once in a while, but this was different. The lights went off and I remember it getting extremely cold.

Without warning something grabbed my throat and was making me unable to breath. As it felt minutes passed on, which it was only seconds, I fell to the bathroom floor on my knees. I don't know how I did this but I was able to say ""why?"" Whatever held me by the neck let go and I was able to breath.

I looked up to see a dark figure in the shape of a man standing above me. It grabbed me again and knocked me off my knees making me bash me head against the sink. I remember it saying to me, ""You don't have the right to question me. You listen and do as your told..."" Here is where I made my second mistake. I tried to get up and run out of the bathroom. Before I could make it a step, it grabbed me and made me fall. It grabbed my arm and twisted it behind my back, then what it felt like finger nails dug into my arm.

This still happens but not always in the bathroom. If anyone knows why they are able to hurt us let me know. If anyone has any info on anything please write. Thanks

My Grandmother is Back,United Kingdom,Family / Friends Visits,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Family / Friends Visits :: My Grandmother is Back

I have already seen my dearly beloved grandmother, who passed in 2005, or so I thought. My other story says how I briefly saw her. Well one night laying in my bed, this teddy, that was described before, re-appeared on top of my tv, my younger brother had just had an operation, which he had before and my grandmother was alive for that, but I was just watching tv when I heard my dog scratching at the door, so I looked at the door, and just as I sat up to go open it, the bottom of my bed dipped, and the warmest and calmest feeling over whelmed me.

As I looked at the bottom of my bed there she was, just staring at my younger brother, and then she turned to me, she looked a lot younger than when she died, but I fought all fear inside of me and said ""Hi"" she smiled at me and answered, this is when our conversation started, we talked about how my younger brother was doing, how I was doing, and then I asked how she was doing, this is when things changed, the warm atmosphere left and everything went cold, she looked at me and said, ""not so good, I need to pass"", and she just vanished, without a sound. I said a prayer, and not being a big believer in god, hoped for the best, and the next time I asked god to help her pass.

Please tell me if I did the right things. And why do I keep getting the mixed feelings emitting from her... Please can anyone help me, private email or comments.

The Wolf Ghost at my Grandmother's Farm,Jordan,Pets / Animals,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Pets / Animals :: The Wolf Ghost at my Grandmother's Farm

T his happened at my grandmother's farm. We go there from time to time to enjoy our time and have fun. It is a pretty big farm and for some reason I believe that it has many secrets under its soil. I was 19 years old and we were on our way to get there. I was in the car with my parents and siblings driving all the way from our house to that farm that takes about an hour in a car, when I kept hearing howlings coming from somewhere as soon as we reached the area that has all the farms that I used to call ""the dead grounds"", as you can hardly notice any living being there, but still it's beautiful with amazing nature.

We reached the farm finding my cousins there, who are about my age. At night we made a big fire, sitting around it and talking when one of my cousins suggested that we start telling each other ghost stories, and since I have a lot of them I went first.

During the story I started hearing the howlings again and I looked around and asked them if they heard the same, they all said no. I asked my family who were with me in the car if they heard that when it happened and they also said no, so I just thought I'm hearing stuff.

After a while we decided to go treasure hunt like the old days when we were much younger, and I did not really find it a good idea because it was way too dark and I was the oldest between them all, and if anything happened to them I will be held responsible, but I agreed.

We took our flash lights and we went down to the woods that are around the farm. We kept searching and looking around in the dark. My little sister did not like it so she kept holding on to me, too scared. I suddenly started to hear the howling again and suddenly I saw this wolf standing on a rock looking at me with yellow eyes that actually looked like flash lights themselves. It kept staring at me for long, I stood in my place shocked and not being able to move, and I pointed the light right at it and it disappeared, and I heard the howling once again.

My sister was asking me what made me do that and I was like ""didn't you see that wolf?"". She said no to me and that I'm starting to scare her.

I yelled at my cousins and told them it's time to go back. While we were walking back I looked behind me and I saw the same wolf standing on the same rock looking at me but it did not look like it wants to attack me, it looked calm and just wanted to look right at me through my eyes.

After getting to the farm house I asked my grand mother if there are any wolves around there, and she told me that she never saw any wolf there, but only once in her life that she heard about a wolf who kept coming and the farmer who takes care of the farm saw the wolf one day, trying to eat one of the horses and he chased him down to the woods and shot him there.

New Year's Eve,Canada,Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: New Year's Eve

I have been meaning to write this story down on this web site for a while now. If anyone had read my story about the night of the eclipse in august, then you should know that this is just a continuation of events that have been happening in the trailer I live in. Another thing I should mention is that the only times there have been a lot of activity all at once were on the night of the eclipse and on New Year's eve.

It started at about dinner time when my boyfriend and I were cleaning up and getting ready to have people over. We kept losing things then finding them right back in the same place a few minutes later. We thought we were just imagining it but it kept happening over and over. It seemed like every time we needed something it would disappear.

After finally getting everything cleaned my friend Carson arrived. He, my boyfriend and I were sitting there watching T.V. talking about nothing in particular when my boyfriend said something and an unknown man's voice said, ""Right!"" in return. The three of us were so confused we looked everywhere to see if our roommates had come home but no one was there. We told them about it later and they told us that they had been hearing the same thing since the night of the eclipse.

A while later I went to the bathroom and I heard a loud cough behind my ear as I was washing my hands. All the hair on my neck stood up and I ran out of there. No one that was there believed me until the rest of our guests showed up. I was drinking after that and so was everyone else except for the 2 designated drivers. One got there before the other and they both said they heard a cough when they were in the bathroom. They didn't know I had heard it or that each other had either so its not hard to tell why everyone believed me after that.

Nothing happened to me the rest of the night but in the morning when I was sobered up as well as everyone else I heard the cough again.

Nothing has happened since though. I am getting worried about holidays and whatnot because it seems that is the only time anything really happens around here.

Family Ghost Story,"New Jersey, United States",Family / Friends Visits,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Family / Friends Visits :: Family Ghost Story

T his is a story that was related to me by my second cousin and then the happenings to me and my daughter in later years. My second cousin who would be in her 90's if alive today, told me her ghost story. When she was in her 20's she and her current boyfriend were talking about death and being contacted from beyond the grave, and he told her that if anything happened to him, he would let her know he was ok. She replied how and he said through a clock.

She said ok and wondered what he meant. 6 months later he killed himself and my cousin was so sad she couldn't eat, messed up at work and had trouble sleeping. She was on the verge of losing her job.

That night when she got home from work, her aunt (who was raising her) told her that the weirdest thing happened. She stated that an old broken clock in the basement kept gonging and gonging and wouldn't stop until she put it on the floor and stomped on it. My cousin took this as a sign from the boyfriend and it helped her to get over her grief.

In 1983 my mother died on Christmas Eve. In January I was going over her belongings (she lived with me) and decided to put her alarm clock in my den. It had a lighted dial and I thought it would be good to keep on top of the TV (this was before tvs displayed the time at a push of a button).

That night I had a dream, but it was really early in the am (still dark) and the dream consisted of me standing in darkness and a voice telling me I had psychic powers and to use them. At first I was scared and refused the ""gift"", the voice was persistent and so I agreed to having them. People started to appear in my dream and I ran up to each one telling them of my gift. Then a loud scary sound started, I woke up and still heard it and realized it was my mother's alarm clock going off.

I got out of bed, went into the den to turn off the alarm button. This old clock had the pin in the back that you pulled out to let it ring and push in to turn it off. BUT when I tried to push it in I realized it was already pushed in, the alarm was set to go off at 8 am and it was only 3:59. I then realized that it was ""mom"" saying hi. Instead I yanked the cord out of the wall to make it stop.

Years later in the 90's, after I moved to Florida, my daughter had the alarm clock sitting on her tv and on Christmas Eve one of those years it ran again and the pin was not pulled out at that time either.

Haunted Norfolk,"Virginia, United States",Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: Haunted Norfolk

H ere are a couple of occurrences that happened to me and my Navy buddies when we were stationed in Norfolk, VA. Three of us shared an apartment off base. It was a two bedroom 1 bath apartment. My friend Brian had one room and or friend Jason had the second room. I was more or less 'the guy on the couch'. If you've seen the racks (beds) in a ships berthing (sleeping quarters) you'd understand why I opted to stay on my friends couch.

We all had a great time during liberty and on nights that we weren't out raising you know what we'd chill out and watch movies, usually order a pizza. During one of our chill nights, our friend Jason started asking us if we'd ever experienced anything odd in the apartment. There were a few things that would weird us out but we never really discussed it much further. He would tell us about times that he would be there alone and hear a little girl laughing in his room. The TV would turn off and on by itself and the remote would always be moved from place to place. Very very strange we thought. We gave him a hard time and told him to chill out with the drinking ha ha.

A week or so after we all discussed this, we were in the living room watching a movie when Jason said, ""see! Look at my door, it's open now"". He claimed to have shut the door and now it was wide open. The three of us went to the door, shut it and each gave it a heave with our shoulder making sure that it wasn't just the door. Sure enough, we'd get in to watching the movie and look over and the door would be wide open! It would always do that from then on, like it didn't want the door shut.

I don't know if this is related but both Brian and Jason would ask me what I would do late at night after they went to bed because they would hear me talking in a weird voice in the living room. They would also venture in to the kitchen and see me sitting bolt upright facing the wall, unresponsive. Weird. I recall none of that.

We had another friend who lived on Ocean BLVD. Supposedly, a prostitute was murdered in the bathroom of the apartment. They had one of those Ghostbuster's toy back packs with the rod hanging on the wall as a joke... One night some people were over and we were talking about the woman who lost her life there and being the ignorant / intoxicated sailors they were that evening, they started yelling at 'her' and asking how much a night would be and cursing at her.

I was pretty disgusted at how disrespectful all that was when all of a sudden a loud, ""Vrreeer Vvvreeeer vvvrrreeer!"" broke the banter. That sound was coming from the Ghostbuster toy that was on the wall across the room from where EVERYBODY was. The only way to make it go off is to press the trigger on it. It is purely mechanical, not electrical at all so for it to go off, the trigger has to be pulled. Needless to say, the tough guys shut up very quickly and headed outside to the balcony.

I'm not going to say that I wasn't a bit freaked but I didn't chuckle to myself thinking, ""you showed them girl"". I stayed inside and talked with my friend who lived there and he proceeded to tell me hat on many occasions when he woke up his cell phone would be off his night stand and on the middle of the floor in a puddle of water or on a damp carpet. I think that may have tied in with her way of passing (bathtub = water).

Those are yet another few of my true stories. More to follow...

Orbs Caught on Film,Canada,Photographs / Videos / EVP,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Photographs / Videos / EVP :: Orbs Caught on Film

A few years ago, a friend of mine had a birthday party at this community centre in this park in town. Everyone was having fun moving between the park and the centre and one friend of mine was taking pictures of the party to give to my friend.

We were outside and he asked me and a few other friends for pictures. The first pictures that he took were normal but then he took one and immediately erased it. We asked what it was and he said his lens got dusty so he cleaned it and took another. Again he said his lens must be dusty and cleaned it off. He took another and finally we asked to see it. There are probably hundreds of little white orbs all over the picture. I told him to take another and it turned out the same. We then moved to a different place and took one more and it was still covered in these little white things. The next picture he took didn't have anything in it at all.

What I want help with is if anyone can tell me if these are genuine orbs or if it was just some camera trick. I know that there have been tragedies in that park before. I girl was murdered there when I was in kindergarten as well as a different girl being murdered there when my mom was in elementary school. It is also not the best area of town, there have been people known to OD or to freeze to death over night in that area before.

Please if you can tell me if these pictures are real or a trick of the camera let me know.

My Shadow Friend,"Wisconsin, United States",A Haunted Life,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: A Haunted Life :: My Shadow Friend

T his story is quite extensive; but I am being patient so I request politely that you are as well. I have quite an amount of information on the paranormal - but this is the one experience which has befuddled me for years. When I was 6 years old I lived in a 100 year old Victorian 3 story home in the (very) small village of Florenceville, New Brunswick, Canada. My father and I have always been quite close, but as a young child he was gone frequently on business. Being a kid - I missed him and would look foreward to the days he would come home. Even though I was young I remember this distinctively.

I was playing in my bedroom, drawing in cardboard boxes to make ""homes"" for my toys (I have a very vivid memory, mind you. This is all true and exactly as I remember.) From the hallway I heard my name being called in a man's voice. My father had been gone for some amount of weeks and I thought perhaps he had showed up at home to surprise me. (naive, I know). I was excited - and I ran out of my room to meet him. My bedroom was on the 2nd floor, and from the hallway outside my bedroom, I could look over a railing and see the entryway below. I looked over the railing (or rather - through the railing, being so short as I was) and below saw the figure of a man, standing silently. There was nothing significant about him, and I noticed immediately that he was not my father. In fact - he was not anything. Just a blackness... Contoured like a man... his, face? He had no face. Merely the outline of what a face would be... But blank. And just as dark. But I could tell - he looked up at me...

At that point I screamed and ran into my bedroom - my mother ran out of the kitchen and when she finally coaxed me out of my room there was nothing in the entry way.

I had dreams about that 'man' for years but it merely became a memory. Shortly after that particular incident my family moved from Florenceville to Moses Lake, Washington - so that my father wouldn't need to travel so often.

The next incident with the shadow - man was when I was about 8. I was sleeping in a bedroom which I shared with my younger sister - and woke up one night for no particular reason. At the time I was a very heavy sleeper (as opposed to now - I am an extremely light sleeper)... and it was surprising that I was awake. Something in the room felt - weird - as a child would think something was 'weird'. I sat up in my bed, and noticed immediately, at the end of the bed was the figure, his elbows leaned on the edge - ""head"" in ""hands""... staring at me. I thought I was seeing something, until it cocked its head... Needless to say I hid under the covers - naeseous - until morning.

Nearly a year later, I was in my bedroom nearing night, getting ready for bed. I opened my closet door - and in the corner was the figure of the man, his knees held up to his chest in a very childish position. His head hidden in his arms. The next few weeks he began appearing subtly in my dreams... But I didn't see him again for quite some time.

In fact - I don't remember seeing him again for many years afterwards.

When I was 11 I moved from Moses Lake to my current location in Central Wisconsin (for the sake of safety I won't give the name of the city.) I didn't think too much about the shadow - man until I turned 14. That year I started to become very agitated out of nowhere. When I walked up the stairs from my basement, my heart would race for no apparent reason. My basement is finished and so not scary in any way... Nothing provoked these feelings in any way.

Out of the corner of my eye, during all times of the day I started seeing a darkness that was slightly unnerving. Being older - I figured I was imagining things and refused to connect the darkness to the shadow - man I had seen as a child.

I began waking up in the middle of the night - scared to death for what seemed like no reason. Of course you could associate this to some sort of mental illness or whatnot, I'm sure... But I have no other history of being distraught or what have you.

I was having panic attacks on a regular basis because I became so frustrated and scared of whatever seemed constantly around me.

After a year of this - there was an evening that really set everything up for me. It had been a few months since my last panic attack and thought everything was a - okay. I was laying in bed, unable to sleep - thinking about school or friends or whatever - when I heard a loud rattling noise. My dog (which sleeps in my bedroom with me) was laying on the bed next to me... And she woke up upon hearing the noise. Immediately I recognized the noise as being the beads hanging on my closet door handle. They were rattling violently, and when I looked in their direction - the noise stopped. The beads were moving ever so slightly but the door was completely closed. What I first noticed though was a black figure, in the shape of a man - looking at me. I admit - I was shaken - ... but upon seeing him face to face for the first time since childhood... I didn't feel terrified. In fact I became quite calm.

I should more thoroughly explain this man. When I see him, like I just said, I feel calm... But sometimes when I merely catch him out of the corner of my eye I feel slightly uneasy. His full - bodied appearances are sometimes accompanied by slight tapping noises but since the bead night nothing quite so loud has ever been heard. When I look at him, he does not immediately disappear. He appears to be dark - but since I usually see him in darkness I recognize that he is not only black but is a void of all light. Darker than the dark that surrounds him. Like a black hole with a body.

There are countless other instances I could record, and if you have any interest in it I could share others. But for now there are a couple other points I'd like to make so you fully understand his nature... Or perhaps can help me to understand.

If I am feeling uneasy, when he's around I feel calm. Sometimes though, when I think too much about what he REALLY might be, I get frightened. I don't know his intentions... If I'm just crazy... If he's some sort of evil who is trying to trick me or just something that needs help. The fact that he's followed me from Canada, to Washington to Wisconsin is a bit unnerving. I didn't think spirits could tag along with a person? I've heard of possessions but I wouldn't even consider this as one.

When I become uneasy about his presence I have told him so. In fact on several occasions I have made his presence known aloud - speaking to him, saying hello... Or at times yelling at him to go away and leave me alone. Usually he doesn't... but sometimes he seems deterred and will leave for long periods of time (sometimes weeks or months).

My long time boyfriend is a partial believer in the paranormal, and certainly open minded. I have told him all the details of my shadow - man and he seems quite interested but thinks maybe it's ""all in my head"". At one point, he challenged him... Trying to provoke him to show himself.

A week later my boyfriend called me in the middle of the night. Stating that he awoke with a start - and as he looked towards his door, what seemed to be a cat - void of light - was at the foot of his bed. He described it with the exact same qualities of my shadow - man. This cat apparently leapt from the floor, claws out towards my boyfriend... As if it were trying to claw at his face. It disappeared before it made contact.

Whenever my boyfriend spends the night... There are occasions where Shadow (as we now call him) will show up. I have felt emotions from Shadow... Usually curiosity (when it's just me) or calmness... Or sadness.

But when my boyfriend is around I feel intense jealousy and anger... The only times I'm ever afraid of his presence

I need some opinions... Or some stories from anyone who has had a similar experience.

Can spirits (or whatever he is) be intelligent enough to have varying emotions? Is he maybe jealous of my boyfriend? My boyfriend thinks he may have a liking for me... Since he's been with me for nearly 11 years. Is this possible? Any experts out there?

I haven't seen him in a few months - the last time I saw him my boyfriend was with me, and I 'told him off'.

I hate to admit it but I kind of miss his presence, don't know whether to call him back or leave it be. Could he possibly need me for something? Should I be afraid or flattered?

Thank you for spending so much time reading all 8670 words to this story. I appreciate it greatly, any help would be fantastic. I'll post further stories (about unrelated ghost stories) at a later time.

HPI Chronicles: The Oakland Cemeteries Scouting Mission,"California, United States",Ghost Hunting,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Ghost Hunting :: HPI Chronicles: The Oakland Cemeteries Scouting Mission

I am getting up at 6am tomorrow (Feb 9, 2008 Saturday). I am meeting a bunch of HPI Paranormal Investigators-in-Training/Scouts at Starbucks on 15th and Broadway at 8am and then we are headed over to Starbucks at 420 West Grand, Oakland to meet up with Anah Denzeiberg, HPI Paranormal Investigator and Guide that will take us to two cemeteries. One is located at 6450 Camden Street, Oakland, and the other is located at 5000 Piedmont Avenue in Oakland.

Michele Stump, HPI Paranormal Investigator/Historian/Researcher, she says:

""The first one (cemetery) contains a mass grave of 412 unidentified victims of the Jonestown massacre. This is the Evergreen cemetery. Here is the website:

http://www.findagrave.com/cgi-bin/fg.cgi?page=gr&GRid=4734 --- The other one contains the grave of Elizabeth Short, aka ""The Black Dahlia"". She was perhaps the most famous murder victim of all time. Her body was found completely bi-sected and lying in an empty lot in Downtown Los Angeles in 1947. Her murder is still a mystery and her killer was never brought to justice. This is the Mountain View Cemetery. Here is the website for more information: http://www.findagrave.com/cgi-bin/fg.cgi?page=gr&GRid=4490""

A quick look into the history of the Peoples' Temple. Charismatic Reverend Jim Jones started the Peoples' Temple in San Francisco. The church he created started innocently enough and he gathered many followers. Jones became friends with politicians and made sure his congregation would support the candidate of Jones' choice.

There were rumors of abuse being done on the members of the Peoples' Temple. Jim Jones decided to move his congregation to an isolated area in Guyana and called his new retreat Jonestown. More rumors surfaced, everything from torture, rape, slavery, drug use, brainwashing, unhealthy living conditions and many other atrocities. It was time for Senator Leo Ryan to look into these allegations. The Senator brought his team to investigate and when secret notes were passed to the Senator detailing the horror of Jonestown, the Senator took some members of the congregation with him. A team of Jones' assassins gunned the Senator and his team down. Later Jim called for a 'white night' and forced his congregation to drink poisoned Kool-Aid. Over 900 people died, including Jim Jones.

Let's do another quick look into history. Let's talk about Elizabeth Short, aka The Black Dahlia. January 1947, police found the body of a woman cut in half at the torso. Her body was found in the Crenshaw district of Los Angeles, CA. The body was of The Black Dahlia, she had been tortured, maimed and murdered. BD was carved into her body and her body was actually sawed in half. There was grass pushed into her private area. It was the worse crime scene that Los Angeles has ever experienced.

The Black Dahlia was a woman that was hungry for fame. She was a small town girl that went to Hollywood to become a movie star. She was very promiscuous and fooled with many servicemen and people in the movie business, as the story goes. She was even rumored to have had intimate relations with Marilyn Monroe. She finally met her grisly fate to an unknown killer. The Black Dahlia was playing Russian Roulette with her life by being a free spirit and trusting strangers. One of those strangers took her life in a horrific way.

Now that we looked into the history of these infamous cases, it's up to HPI to see if we can locate any paranormal activity at these grave sites.

Roll Call for HPI Paranormal Investigators-in-training: Anah Denzeiberg - Guide; Kevin Jones - Videographer for Current TV; Stephen Henderson; Monica Talani, Debbie Talani, Scott Reber, Jessie Garcia, Tavia Jones, Karen Dowd, Maria Alarcon, Amberine Frehman, Nicol Fletcher and Maria Eivers.

Roll Call for HPI Core Member Paranormal Investigators: Holly DeLaughter - Sensitive/Professional Photographer; Michele Stump - Researcher/Historian; Paul Dale Roberts - Ghostwriter, Tim Hawkins - Lead Investigator, Chris Grissom - Technician and Shannon McCabe, HPI president.

Our first stop was the Evergreen Cemetery. Michele Stump and I, gave a briefing on the history of the Peoples' Temple, Jonestown and the Guyana Poisoned Kool-Aid Massacre for all the investigators. Shannon McCabe gave a briefing in regard to how to use various ghost hunting equipment, how to analyze what they find and areas to conduct their search.

Shannon and I, broke up the teams and sent them on their way to do their investigations. Tim Hawkins located the Guyana victim's mass grave site, we all brought out our audio digital recorders for some possible EVPs. Debbie Talani scouted out a location for the Oakland Chapter Hell's Angels grave sites. I gave a history lesson on the Hell's Angels for the group and then we took digital photographs of the grave sites and did some EVP work. Debbie Talani took a picture of one of the Hell's Angel's grave site and it appears she captured some ectoplasm on her film. But after further scrutiny by Debbie, she ruled out the ectoplasm and determined it to be a glare. Debbie also showed Shannon and I, a picture she took at the last scouting mission at the Sutter Creek Palace, in which she captures what looks like a ghostly face on a picture hanging on the wall.

Our second stop was the gorgeous Mountain View Cemetery and Anah points out Section 66, which is where Elizabeth Short aka the Black Dahlia is buried. Michele Stump and I, give a brief history lesson the horrible crime that was committed upon the Black Dahlia, while Kevin Jones filmed away for Current TV. We did some more EVP work and snapped a whole lot of photos. Everything we investigated is pending analysis. After this investigation, Shannon and I, gave a debriefing on the purpose of this scouting mission, what we are seeking and how we can all become better investigators.

To end this fantastic scouting mission, we all headed over to the Raj India Cuisine, 4086 Piedmont Avenue, Oakland, CA 94611. If you ever have a chance, stop at this fabulous restaurant and try out their exotic food. I tried out their spicy lamb with bell peppers, herbs, Indian spices, tomatoes, curry over rice. My God, it made my ghostly taste buds tingle!

This day was a gorgeous, warm beautiful day, with clear blue skies, it was an exciting scouting mission and as I packed up Debbie, Scott, Monica and Michele in my car, we did a convoy back to Sacramento, with Chris Grissom and Tim Hawkins leading us out of Oakland and back to Sacramento. Now the core members have to get ready for another investigation, an all-nighter at the Sacramento Theater Company! We are all meeting at 11:15pm to stay awake until the wee hours!

HPI Paranormal Investigators roll call: Bryan Coleman - Videographer; Michele Stump - Researcher/Historian; John Wachter - Vice President; Paul Dale Roberts - Ghostwriter; Chris Grissom - Technician; Donna Reynolds - Sensitive; Tim Hawkins - Lead Investigator; Shannon McCabe - President; Maria Eivers - Empath; Holly DeLaughter - Professional Photograph / Sensitive.

Guests from Chicago and San Jose, CA: Greg McAleer and David Jimenez- These two great guys will be having a national ghost hunting show on a very famous channel! Greg flew in from Chicago to ""interview"" HPI for his upcoming show!

Sacramento Theater Company Costume Shop Manager: Jessica Minnihan.

As soon as we walked in, Michele Stump felt this 'elevator' feeling in one of the rooms of this theater. Maria felt her hands go numb in the same room. It was turning out to be an exciting night!

I interviewed both Greg and David and asked them what type of paranormal experiences they had and how they got into reality TV, here is what they said:

Greg McAleer: Greg tells me that he investigated the Whaley House in San Diego with a lot of great results. He lived in a haunted house growing up. He moved in this home at the age of 11. In this home, someone committed suicide. He remembers hearing ghostly footsteps and at age 16 there were a series of loud knocks on the walls that frightened him. Once Greg walked into what felt like a force field and when he came out of it, his brain felt like it was swimming in water, he felt like he had a hangover, but hadn't been drinking, he will never forget that eerie experience. After living in this haunted house, Greg has always had a fascination for the paranormal. He is also an incredible cameraman.

David Jimenez: Once he was taking pictures and felt a strong tug at his arm by an unseen force. His camera malfunctioned in a haunted location for no apparent reason. When David lived in Boston he remembers a time when he saw a full body apparition of a woman sitting on the floor watching TV and when he approached the woman, she vanished. He felt a presence at a local tattoo parlor. David is actually Greg's cast member for their upcoming reality series!

Be on the lookout for the show: Sorry we can't tell you the name, but when we can, we will!

After my interviews with Greg and David, I floated around to the teams in various locations of the theater to see what they were experiencing. We saw some floating orbs on the video monitor, we conducted two seances in two different locations of the theater that has the most activity and there were no results. Chris, Holly and Michele heard metallic tapping sounds in the costume shop area, but the tapping sounds had no intelligent responses back. Michele and Holly heard strange creaking sounds, but that could be chalked up to the building being so old. I captured a possible EVP of a dog barking which sounded like 'yip yip'. John Wachter also took a picture of a blueish orb, we need further analysis on it to determine if it is paranormal. The only thing that I found really paranormal that happened tonight was when I conducted the two seances, someone's stomach made a loud growling noise, which made the seance circle jump!

All the evidence is being analyzed and we'll send our results to Shannon. Be sure to check www.HPIparanormal.net for updated findings.

Since I am in the comic book business, it is my duty for my business Jazma Online! To see what comic books are on the market. I do reviews, interviews within the comic book industry. Also, since I am in the ghost hunting business, I might as well combine both industries and discover what paranormal comic books are in the market right now. On Feb 8, 2008, Friday, I went to A1 Comics and checked out their racks for new and exciting paranormal comics or comics that touch upon the paranormal and here is what I found: Midnighter #16 - Wildstorm; Northlanders - Sven the Returned - Vertigo; The Vinyl Underground #5 - Vertigo; Doktor Sleepless - Your Imaginary Friend #5 - Avatar; Eve - Vampire Diva #3 - Arcana; Full Cirkle 1a - Full Circle; Incursion #3 - Platinum Studios; Jungle Girl 4 - Dynamite; The Misadventures of Clark and Jefferson Book 2 - Ape Entertainment; MidKnight - Red 5 Comics; The Overman Book 3 - Image; Space Doubles - The 3rd World News; Ubu Bubu - Slave Labor Graphics; Ed Burn's Dockwalloper - Virgin Comics. Marvel Comics has a whole slew of bizarre comics like: The Twelve, Omega the Unknown, Moby Dick, Lords of Avalon, Sword of Darkness, Clandestine, Annihilation Conquest and Anita Blake - Vampire Hunter.

So, if you don't have any paranormal work to do, stop by A1 Comics in Sacramento and discover some intriguing paranormal comics to read! While you are conducting surveillance and are getting bored to your wits end, you can read a good paranormal comic book! That is my recommendation!

Before I go, I wrote the article called 'The 6 Types of Hauntings'. Then remembered there is a 7th Type of Haunting! It's called 'The Religious Haunting'. The Religious Haunting is where a dwelling, an establishment or even a person may be haunted by something of religious significance. Case Example: The Miracle of Fatima, in which the Virgin Mary appeared. Some people make claims of seeing the face of Jesus Christ in the bark of their oak tree or even in a bowl of Cheerios. Some people fall victim of stigmata, the bleeding of the palms, forehead, feet. These are the locations of the body, in which Jesus received his wounds after being crucified on the cross. There are angel sightings, many angel sightings have occurred at car crashes with fatalities. So add this to your list of hauntings!

Debbie Talani contacted me and told me that at the Evergreen Cemetery, when Shannon was explaining about the temperature fluctuations, an EVP was picked up of a cat meowing and there were no cats around.

Debbie Talani laid her audio digital recorder at the Elizabeth Short gravesite. And when Anah and Michele were talking, the EVP of a male voice says ""I'm in love"".

Seeing Family Relatives,"New York, United States",Family / Friends Visits,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Family / Friends Visits :: Seeing Family Relatives

A s we sometimes set in my parent's living room we will see a figure of a person go by the living room window. My dad he also experience this in his living room. I have actually seen a women with a red turban on her head run by. My other aunt who is still alive says my aunt who passed away wore this color turban on her head.

I have also seen a man figure. My dad or I will go to the door thinking someone has come to visit and nobody will be there. Just recently my mom had seen someone walk by and no one was there. This gives me cold chills because I don't understand what is happening to my dad and me. My gut feeling tells me it is my grandfather and my deceased aunt. I also have dreams of someone getting sick and it happens not to the person I dream about, but to somebody I know usually in the same family. I dreamed my younger brother went in a coma and it actually happened to my brother who was two years older.

If you could help me with this experiences, I will tell some more things that have happen to me in my dreams also. It has happened to me so much, I tell my mother to watch out for family members who seem sick. I just had a dream in october 2007 my dad had a stroke but it was my uncle and he died shortly after.

Chester Haunting,United Kingdom,Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: Chester Haunting

I have always been quite taken with the idea of the paranormal and was luckily enough to live in a haunted house for 8 years. This was a town house in chester and shortly after moving in, we got used to hearing the slamming of the front door, followed by the sound of someone running up the stairs... this, we explained by the fact that our neighbours front door and stairs were just through the wall from ours and we thought it was them, slamming their own front door and running upstairs.

However we quickly came to realize, that our neighbours consisted of a quite slow moving older lady, not given to slamming or running anywhere, and her disabled daughter who couldn't do either. But we never gave it much thought, it was ""just one of those things"".

Then, one evening when I was working late, my very skeptical partner, was lying in bed, not, he assured me asleep, turning over a particularly difficult work concern over and over in his mind, when he became aware of something standing next to him. On opening his eyes he caught a glimpse of a slight, small figure in white with very blond hair, slipping out of the bedroom. Our daughter was 3 or 4 at the time and had blond hair and was wearing a white nightdress that night, so my partner quickly got up, thinking she had been disturbed in her sleep and come for help, returning to her own room when she thought he was asleep. He found our little girl fast asleep. She would have only been a few paces ahead of him anyway, but she was snuggled down, as warm as toast, and quite deeply asleep.

He checked the boys, both of whom were fast asleep and it was only on returning to our room he realized that he hadn't heard the bedroom door open, it was quite heavy and dragged on the carpet when opening. So now we were a little more aware, not alarmed, but a little more watchful.

We had good friends who lived a few doors away, we held front door keys for each other and would check each others houses, putting lights on, feeding cats etc, if either of us were away from home. A year of so after the bedroom incident, a 3rd friend turned up to visit my friend of a few doors away, ""Is C poorly?"" she asked, enquiring after my little girl, ""No, why?"" asked my friend ""oh I saw her looking out of her bedroom window, when I passed, she looked quite pale and didn't wave back to me"" said the other friend. My friend said she went quite cold when told this and replied ""but the whole family are away for the weekend, I opened the curtains and turned the lights out a couple of hours ago""... her husband was called and the 3 of them searched the house from top to bottom and, of course found nothing.

So this was how things went for the time we stayed in that house, every month or so there would be the slam of the door, and then the running footsteps, sometimes you would catch something white on the edge of your vision. Having young children, and this being in the time of negative equity, we kept quiet about it, it didn't frighten us and just became something we lived with.

Then one day I was off work, the middle boy had some childhood illness. And I'd taken the day to be with him. I had just come out of his bedroom, my arms full of dirty bed sheets. He was quite ill. And was about to walk down the stairs, the front door being at the end of the short hallway, right in front of me, when I heard the door slam, of course I looked up to see the door in its usual place, and then the running steps came up the stairs, ran right behind me and disappeared into my eldest sons bedroom. The hairs on my neck certainly prickled! And then my poorly son called to ask if that was his big brother coming home.

On another occasion when the oldest son was 15 he had a very bad bout of chicken pox and was off school, when he heard the door slam and heard the running footsteps. He knew it was too early for either I or his dad to be home and also, as the house was quiet, heard the footsteps run into his room. He phoned me at work demanding why we hadn't told him the house was haunted. He was so angry!

We moved out a couple of years after that. Due to having to relocate for employment reasons, and it was only recently that we told the younger children, who were also put out at living in a haunted house and not knowing... smiles. I can honestly say we, those of us in the house who knew about it, never felt frightened by the experience. The strangest thing was, when we moved out to suffolk, we had to take a temporary house for a few months and then moved into our own home.

On the evening of the move I was completely worn out, it was early summer and my husband said he would take the kids off for a walk while I took myself off for a bath and early bed. I was just getting into bed when I heard the front door slam and the sound of running feet, climbing stairs. I called out a ""hi"" to let them know I was awake still and got no reply. I realized then that I'd heard the sound of feet running up stairs. The new house was a bungalow. We never heard or saw anything in that house after that. Now my current home, built in the 1700s is quite another story...

Man Figure Falls Into a Ditch,Mexico,Apparitions / Voices / Touches,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Apparitions / Voices / Touches :: Man Figure Falls Into a Ditch

M ost members of my family live in Atlixco, Mexico. A small village like place, the kind of place were everyone knows each other. Last year in August, me and my mother went there to pay respect to my deceased brother, like every other year for five years, but this visit was different.

We were staying at my grandfather's place (my mother's dad, since she doesn't get along with my father's side of the family) and he lives down this big hill, basically it's sort of isolated but the view is amazing. Since it's only one room I had to sleep on the floor while my mother slept on the bed, my uncle slept in a corner on the other side of the room, and we were all asleep, well they were, I wasn't.

It was raining that night and I can't sleep when it rains for some odd reason. I started to hear noises outside of the door (which is like this blue metal door with designs on it but no glass to cover up the top of it which is bare.) I went to check it out and there was someone or something standing outside at the bottom of the stairs. I couldn't really make out the figure but it looked like a man.

So I'm thinking it's my grandpa because he's not inside, and because the dogs aren't barking, he owns a lot of dogs. So I stood there watching him thinking maybe I should open the door for him but as I open the latch my uncle's kitten (also known as my great aunt) comes out hissing at the figure, panicking, I closed the door back up. And the figure just starts backing away, towards this deep ditch (my grandpa dug for some reason I think he said it was to keep us safe or something.) and I'm thinking Oh my god he's going to fall so I run out in the pouring rain, but it's to late he just falls into the ditch or so it looked like it. I bend over to see but there's no one there. I went back inside, and still everyone's asleep and that's when I notice my Grandfather sleeping under the table (he's paranoid that someone's trying to get him or maybe he was drunk.)

I remember just thinking what if it comes back? Or maybe I'm insane. Either way I got the nerve to go back outside, and I sat on the ground leaning next to the door, with a blanket, I don't think it was for me since I didn't use it. The rest of it is a blur.

The next day my mother confronts me at dinner, asking me why I was sitting outside all of last night, I couldn't remember doing this so I told her that I didn't now what she was taking about. Then after an awkward silence she asked me who was the man I was waiting for. I had no clue what she was talking about, but it was freaking me out.

Later she told me that when she had asked me in the morning, what was I doing sitting out here, I responded by saying I'm waiting for him to come back. I can't even remember any of this except for seeing the figure. I still have no idea what compelled me to go towards the figure or even why I sat outside waiting for it. It still bothers me maybe I should have let it in.

I'm beginning to think maybe it was the spirit of my brother and it makes me feel guilty.

The Mirror at Anima,Greece,Haunted Places,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Haunted Places :: The Mirror at Anima

I 'm writing a fragment of a much larger story with certain reluctance. In most parts, it still remains a mystery refusing to unravel. On a few occasions I dare to think that I might have found the answers to my questions but not with absolute certainty.

When my second husband and I got married three years ago, we decided that, having spent quite a long time teaching, we were ready to take up a new challenge and start our own business (we would be teaching in the morning and running a bar-restaurant) at night. We bought the business from a distressed acquaintance of ours who, after ten years, wished to ""take it easy"" for a while. I instantly fell in love with the place which had a hundred and fifty year-old history behind it. It used to be the home of a Turkish family which had lived on the island for over 200 years. The first owner's son had, at some time, turned it into the first Turkish restaurant in town introducing its eastern dishes to the Greek inhabitants. Then the restaurant changed hands when the first owner grew too old to run it and after all these years, here we come in the picture to buy the business but not the land or the construction on it. That still belongs to the same family.

Just to acquaint you with the place I will just say that the house remains as it was, built of stone in a c-shape. On the front, there's a busy road and at the back there's a 600-square-meter yard where everything grows and flourishes! That includes a 150-year-old vine, numerous trees and an amazing collection of plants and flowers.

During renovations, I would spend endless hours in that yard listening to every sound, touching every single flower cutting every dead leaf. I feel a very close connection to nature and always believed that if you stand still for a while, you will hear it whisper back to you. So, when my husband asked me to name the place, I felt that the place had already chosen its name and that was and still is ""Anima"" from the Latin word which means life/soul.

When renovations finished, I was responsible for decorating it and, having discovered some antiques in one of the store-rooms I decided to give it an ""eastern touch"" (carpets on the walls, large cushions on the wooden floors and such). Old mirrors and candle holders were once again polished and added to the rest of the decoration.

The first couple of years Anima was everyone's popular meeting place and everyone wanted to work for us. That, of course, came to change... It was at around 7pm one day when I was parking my car outside. During weekdays the only ones working there were the cook who came at 4pm for an hour and a half kitchen preparations and then back again at 8 and a bar-tender (apart from my husband and myself). As I came out of the car, I noticed that every light in the bar was switched on (the dimmer was turned to maximum) and the girl who was working inside the bar that night, was sitting outside with the front door open.

I froze for a moment as I realized that something serious had happened. When I finally approached to ask her what was wrong she started crying and telling me that she feared I was going to laugh at her. I managed to calm her down for a while and persuaded her to get inside with me. When inside, she finally let on that she had been hearing crashing noises coming from the kitchen and the bathroom and that she had, at some point, felt like something had passed in front of her.

I asked her to direct me to the place she had heard the sounds in an attempt to see if she would stick to her story and all this had not simply been a panic attack. She pointed towards the kitchen and the bathroom again but when I made my way towards that direction, she fled towards the front door once more. Having inspected the kitchen and finding nothing more than a few pieces of broken glass on the floor, I proceeded to the bathroom with my patience running thin because of that girl's childish behaviour. I was absolutely convinced that she must have placed a drinking glass too close to the edge of the kitchen table and had then knocked it over. But, upon entering the bathroom, I felt my heart coming to a halt as I noticed some more pieces on the floor and, as I turned my eyes to check around, I realized that the pieces had fallen off the bathroom mirror on the left. I gained some courage as I, for an instance, ""captured"" the logic behind the phenomenon and yelled at her to come back in.

""I found the suspect"" and smiled to Elisavet who was now half way in. ""Help me collect the pieces"". She asked me what I meant and I told her that the mirror in the bathroom had somehow broken and that these things happen when objects wear off with time. ""As for the kitchen, you must have knocked off a glass or something"" I added to hear her deny the accusation. ""I was out here when I heard the noise in there! And I felt like this cold wind passing by me, almost through me! Oh, I'm never coming in here first unless one of you is here already!""

I gave up the effort to calm her down and I proceeded to clean up the place myself but as I entered the kitchen again, I felt like something was watching me from a corner. I attributed this feeling to an influence her panic had on me but, just to be on the safe side, I kept talking with her as I went about my business. I collected the broken glass and started making coffee when I felt what I can only describe as something had sat on my chest making it difficult for me to breathe. I pretended to ignore the feeling and in less than 20 minutes the cook arrived accompanied by my husband.

Time passed with all of us running about to welcome and serve the customers but on our way back home I felt my heart pounding as my husband told me that he was really fed up fixing ""that freaking mirror for the third time"". He was convinced that the cleaning lady had been careless with it. It was at that when I realized that, had the cleaner broken it, Elisavet would have seen the glasses as soon as she entered the bar and even if she had missed it, the cook who had previously been there to make preparations for the night, would have cleaned them up before coming back at 8.

The Story of Sleeping Sydney,"California, United States",Ghost Hunting,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Ghost Hunting :: The Story of Sleeping Sydney

A year ago we found out that in our house, in 1878, a 15 year old girl had been murdered. She was sleeping, and was stabbed in the back with a knife. Her name was Sydney Hyde. The Hydes never lived there again. Now, the spirit of Sydney haunts our house for over a year.

We moved in 2006 about Christmas time. After living in the house for about a month I couldn't sleep all night and I noticed that the lights in the hall were flickering, and of course I thought it was my little 7 year old daughter not sleeping in the middle of the night, so I went to check on her and when I walked out of my bedroom I saw she was sleeping in her bed and the lights were flickering off and on by themselves.

Afterwards my daughter told me that when she woke up one day to go to school and went into her changing room, the hangers with her clothes were sliding. I thought this had to be dealt with in some way so my husband and I sat in my little girl's room as she slept, and screaming was heard coming from everywhere. It woke my daughter and we all ran from it.

My husband and I called a ghost hunter that was closest to us in Glendale. He came the next morning and said he'd have to stay in my little girl's room that night so he could see what Sydney wants and how to maybe get rid of her. So he sat with us and discussed the matter closely and asked questions like, ""Around what time did the screaming start?"" or ""Did you notice any particular smell or something that you really wanted at the time, like some ghosts make you want watermelon or to drink lemonade?"" It all sounded queer as if I was some kind of a show contestant, but I still answered his questions and we found out that my daughter was the most sensitive to the ghost.

She told us that every time she is in the room alone she smells some type of perfume that she doesn't know the name of. I was amazed at this fact. The ghost hunter suggested that we should see if she can recognize the perfume. He took out his case that he was carrying and told her to sniff little samplers. She shook her head no to everything and the ghost hunter almost lost hope of finding the right perfume when she sniffed the second to last sampler and told him that was it. The perfume was an old French Chanel 5. It was mid 17th century. We took turns smelling the sampler and trying to remember the smell so that we could recognize it when the room begins to smell like it.

That same night we sat in my girl's room and listened, and there it was again that frightening screaming that almost deafened us. It was not that it was very loud, it was that it was so scary. We stayed in the room with the hunter this time so we could see what he was going to do. He leaned against the bed and almost yelled, ""Are you Sidney Hyde?"" The screaming ceased. It was quiet as the dead for the next few moments and then the pillows in the bed rocked silently. The hunter nodded to us. ""You like Chanel 5 don't you?"" he asked the ghost. The clothes hangers screeched against the metal bar they were hanging on. The hunter nodded to us again and the smell came into the room.

It became very cold all of a sudden and my daughter ran and hid behind me and I told the ghost hunter that we would continue this later when she gets to sleep a little. She had been awake for three nights and had no naps whatsoever so I would assume that she was tired. We went to my bedroom and I sat next to my daughter as she lay there on my bed. ""Mommy, I can't sleep I'm thinking about... About her..."" she told me. I insisted on her sleeping but she kept repeating that she was thinking of her, of Sydney.

I told the ghost hunter that we had to get out of the house and my husband called a hotel, Comfort Suites. We drove there and on our way there she finally fell asleep. She was that tired that it overpowered everything she was thinking of. We went to sleep as well and by morning we heard a fire truck or a siren of that sort. When we went back home we discovered that the house was charcoal black and that all of out belongings were burnt. The house itself was standing in perfect shape it was just that it was black. We were told that the oil pipes were leaking and that something made a spark and the house was on fire for split seconds before it turned black but luckily, no one was inside.

Shadow of my Old Cat,"New York, United States",Pets / Animals,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Pets / Animals :: Shadow of my Old Cat

M y family and I had a cat named Deliah for ten years. We've gotten really close to her, then she started growing these growths (they weren't cancerous so they can't really be called tumors) it was like one HUGE clump, or should I say a series of lumps. Deliah would always limp whenever she would walk, it was such a sad sight.

So one day (her last day) she had a vet's appointment, how I dreaded that day. I was too sad to go, because we all knew what was destined for Deliah. My parents just asked, ""Is it time doc?"" He said ""Yes, oh yes, it's time..."" That was it, Deliah was dead. BAM, for awhile I hated the vets, because they just KILL an animal like that, but I guess it's better that way...

Then a little over a month later, we adopted another cat named Dora. She was great, she would explore everywhere! Once morning, I had to wake up for school. I was eating breakfast, and I hate having the light on when I just woke up. I saw a black figure walk past my chair in the dark, it was a little figure of course, it was a cat.

I know it wasn't Dora (the new cat) because she had white, big, patchy spots on her back. Deliah's back was all black. And Dora was somewhere else in the house.  I don't know it could've been my eyes...

But a year or so later, I was at my aunt and uncle's house for thanksgiving. Their dog died, months ago. I could've sworn I saw a dog like figure when I was there, but I'm not so sure so don't take my word on it. I've always wanted to see a ghost, so seeing a cat or dog's ghost is really cool. But I don't really know if I did, but I'm pretty sure that I did see Deliah...

Something in the Atmosphere,Australia,Apparitions / Voices / Touches,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Apparitions / Voices / Touches :: Something in the Atmosphere

F eeling relaxed and confident that the children were fast asleep I decided to have my fare share of net surfing while I could, at 11pm. Hubby was out back in his workshop doing some last minute maintenance on our 1991 Toyota Torago. Roaming a few sites I ended up on Friendster, a network site and a way of keeping in touch with family and friends from Philippines.

I was checking my messages and updating photos to my account when a shadow cast itself upon the wall in front, as though someone had passed behind me. Thinking it was my eldest daughter passing by to retrieve ice from the freezer nearby, as she normally does at any time of day or night, I waited for the opening of the freezer door and the rattling of the ice box, but there was no sound at all.

Instantly, there was a change in the atmosphere as if something bad was present in the room. For some odd reason I felt so afraid. The hairs on the back of my neck stood up on ends. A cold chill ran down my spine and I began to break out in a sweat, all over. Unable to explain what was happening I jumped from the chair and ran out to the garage to where hubby was tinkering away at whatever it was he needed to do. ""There's someone in the house!"" I grabbed his hand and lead him into the house.

He immediately searched every room without question. ""Where'd you see him?"" he finally asked. Now, how was I to explain that the one I was speaking of was not of this world? Feeling embarrassed, I told him what had happened. Hubby just looked at me, confused, then said ""Just pray my love..."" With that he kissed me and went back to his maintenance. I guess, he was used to my explanations of paranormal occurrences, unlike myself, I am still not getting used to them.

This event happened late last year. It truly freaked me out, and until now, when I think about it, it still gives me the chills...

Feelings of Dread and Orbs,Australia,Orbs / Lights / Mists,"You are here: Real Ghost Stories :: Orbs / Lights / Mists :: Feelings of Dread and Orbs

F our nights ago, my husband and I went to bed quite late, around 12:30am. I guess we both dozed off as soon as our heads hit the pillow. I was suddenly awakened. Thinking it was time to wake the children to get ready for school, I checked the mobile phone for the time, and it was only 2:58am.

Just as suddenly as I had waken up, a feeling of dread filled the room. Even in my state of half awake, I felt the room cool and it seemed as though there was a bad presence nearby. I closed my eyes and prayed that this feeling, deep in the pits of my stomach, would go away.

After a minute or so, I opened my eyes, and there floating around the room were three spirit like objects. Two in the shape of orbs and one big one which looked like a faint white bed sheet. It seemed that the two orbs were aggressively following the bigger spirit around the bedroom. They would intertwine with this other spirit as if they were trying to push it away.

Soon the bigger spirit disappeared and the two orbs were entwining with each other as though playing. The bad feeling immediately went away and a happy feeling filled the atmosphere. I watched these orbs as they played and chased each other. I felt at peace and enjoyed watching them at play.

I couldn't go back to sleep for the rest of the night. It was an incredible experience.
